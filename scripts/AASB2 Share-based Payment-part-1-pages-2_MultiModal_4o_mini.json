        "text": "# Accounting Standard AASB 2\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board made Accounting Standard AASB 2 Share-based Payment under section 334 of the Corporations Act 2001 on 24 July 2015.\n\nThis compiled version of AASB 2 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. It incorporates relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 20 December 2021 (see Compilation Details).\n\n## Accounting Standard AASB 2\n### Share-based Payment\n\n#### Objective\n1. The objective of this Standard is to specify the financial reporting by an entity when it undertakes a share-based payment transaction. In particular, it requires an entity to reflect in its profit or loss and financial position the effects of share-based payment transactions, including expenses associated with transactions in which share options are granted to employees.\n\n**AusCF1** AusCF paragraphs and footnotes included in this Standard apply only to:\n- (a) not-for-profit entities; and\n- (b) for-profit entities that are not applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards).\n\nSuch entities are referred to as \u2018AusCF entities\u2019. For AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is defined in AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF paragraphs or footnotes.\n\n#### Scope\n2. An entity shall apply this Standard in accounting for all share-based payment transactions, whether or not the entity can identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received, including:\n- (a) equity-settled share-based payment transactions,\n- (b) cash-settled share-based payment transactions, and\n- (c) transactions in which the entity receives or acquires goods or services and the terms of the arrangement provide either the entity or the supplier of those goods or services with a choice of whether the entity settles the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by issuing equity instruments,\n\nexcept as noted in paragraphs 3A\u20136. In the absence of specifically identifiable goods or services, other circumstances may indicate that goods or services have been (or will be) received, in which case this Standard applies.\n\n3A. A share-based payment transaction may be settled by another group entity (or a shareholder of any group entity) on behalf of the entity receiving or acquiring the goods or services. Paragraph 2 also applies to an entity that:\n- (a) receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group entity) has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction, or\n- (b) has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same group receives the goods or services\n\nunless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity receiving them.",

        "text": "\n# AASB 2 - Compiled\n\n## 4\nFor the purposes of this Standard, a transaction with an employee (or other party) in his/her capacity as a holder of equity instruments of the entity is not a share-based payment transaction. For example, if an entity grants holders of a particular class of its equity instruments the right to acquire additional equity instruments of the entity at a price that is less than the fair value of those equity instruments, and an employee receives such a right because he/she is a holder of equity instruments of that particular class, the granting or exercise of that right is not subject to the requirements of this Standard.\n\n## 5\nAs noted in paragraph 2, this Standard applies to share-based payment transactions in which an entity acquires or receives goods or services. Goods includes inventories, consumables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets. However, an entity shall not apply this Standard to transactions in which the entity acquires goods as part of the net assets acquired in a business combination as defined by AASB 3 Business Combinations, in a combination of entities or businesses under common control as described in paragraphs B1\u2013B4 of AASB 3, or the contribution of a business on the formation of a joint venture as defined by AASB 11 Joint Arrangements. Hence, equity instruments issued in a business combination in exchange for control of the acquiree are not within the scope of this Standard. However, equity instruments granted to employees of the acquiree in their capacity as employees (e.g. in return for continued service) are within the scope of this Standard. Similarly, the cancellation, replacement or other modification of share-based payment arrangements because of a business combination or other equity restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this Standard. AASB 3 provides guidance on determining whether equity instruments issued in a business combination are part of the consideration transferred in exchange for control of the acquiree (and therefore within the scope of AASB 3) or are in return for continued service to be recognised in the post-combination period (and therefore within the scope of this Standard).\n\n## 6\nThis Standard does not apply to share-based payment transactions in which the entity receives or acquires goods or services under a contract within the scope of paragraphs 8\u201310 of AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation or paragraphs 4.2\u20134.7 of AASB 9 Financial Instruments.\n\n## 6A\nThis Standard uses the term \u2018fair value\u2019 in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of fair value in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. Therefore, when applying AASB 2 an entity measures fair value in accordance with this Standard, not AASB 13.\n\n## Recognition\n\n## 7\nAn entity shall recognise the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction when it obtains the goods or the services are received. The entity shall recognise a corresponding increase in equity if the goods or services were received in an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, or a liability if the goods or services were acquired in a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.\n\n## 8\nWhen the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction do not qualify for recognition as assets, they shall be recognised as expenses.\n\n## 9\nTypically, an expense arises from the consumption of goods or services. For example, services are typically consumed immediately, in which case an expense is recognised as the counterparty renders service. Goods might be consumed over a period of time or, in the case of inventories, sold at a later date, in which case an expense is recognised when the goods are consumed or sold, because they do not qualify for recognition as assets. For example, an entity might acquire goods as part of the research phase of a project to develop a new product. Although those goods have not been consumed, they might not qualify for recognition as assets under the applicable Standard.\n\n## Equity-settled share-based payment transactions\n\n### Overview\n\n## 10\nFor equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, directly, at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the\n",
