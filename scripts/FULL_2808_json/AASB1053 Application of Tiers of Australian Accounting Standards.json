The notion of public accountability is consistent with the\nnotion adopted by the IASB in its International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized\n_Entities (IFRS for SMEs). It is different from the notion of public accountability in the general sense of the_\nterm that is often employed in relation to not-for-profit, including public sector, entities.  \nB2 The following for-profit entities are deemed to have public accountability:  \n(a) disclosing entities, even if their debt or equity instruments are not traded in a public market or are\nnot in the process of being issued for trading in a public market;  \n(b) co-operatives that issue debentures;  \n(c) registered managed investment schemes;  \n(d) superannuation plans regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) other\nthan Small APRA Funds as defined by APRA Superannuation Circular No. III.E.1 Regulation of\n_Small APRA Funds, December 2000; and_  \n(e) authorised deposit-taking institutions.  \nB3 Some entities may also hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders because they hold\nand manage financial resources entrusted to them by clients, customers or members not involved in the\nmanagement of the entity. However, if they do so for reasons incidental to a primary business (as, for\nexample, may be the case for travel or real estate agents, schools, charitable organisations, co-operative\nenterprises requiring a nominal membership deposit and sellers that receive payment in advance of delivery\nof the goods or services such as utility companies), that does not make them publicly accountable.  \nB4 Examples of entities that hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders as one of its\nprimary businesses are most likely to include banks, credit unions, insurance companies, securities\nbrokers/dealers, mutual funds and investment banks.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Background to Differential Reporting in Australia  \nBC2 A form of differential reporting has been incorporated in Accounting Standards in Australia since the early\n1990s. The concept of \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is at the core of this differential reporting regime. Statement of\nAccounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity deals with the reporting entity concept. The\nAASB Glossary of Defined Terms includes the definition of a reporting entity[1] as:  \nAn entity in respect of which it is reasonable to expect the existence of users who rely on the\nentity\u2019s general purpose financial statement for information that will be useful to them for making\nand evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources. A reporting entity can be a single\nentity or a group comprising a parent and all of its subsidiaries.  \nBC3 Most Australian Accounting Standards include the requirements of corresponding International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRSs) and have the following application paragraph:  \nThis Standard applies to:  \n(a) each entity that is required to prepare financial reports in accordance with Part 2M.3 of\nthe Corporations Act and that is a reporting entity;  \n(b) general purpose financial statements of each other reporting entity; and  \n(c) financial statements that are, or are held out to be, general purpose financial statements.  \nPrior to AASB 1053, for-profit and not-for-profit (NFP) entities falling within the scope of this application\nparagraph were subject to all the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements of\nthose Standards. These entities included entities incorporated under the _Corporations Act 2001 that are_\nreporting entities.  \nBC4 Under the Corporations Act, disclosing entities, public companies (including companies limited by\nguarantee), large proprietary companies and registered schemes must prepare and lodge financial statements\nthat comply with accounting standards. Large proprietary companies are those companies that meet at least\ntwo of the three size thresholds set out in the Corporations Act relating to:  \n(a) the consolidated revenue for the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any);  \n(b) the value of the consolidated gross assets at the end of the financial year of the company and the\nentities it controls (if any); and  \n(c) the number of employees of the company and the entities it controls (if any) at the end of the\nfinancial year.  \nThese Corporations Act size thresholds effectively remove the external reporting obligations for small\nproprietary companies.[2]  \nBC5 Accordingly, prior to AASB 1053, a reporting burden that is less than compliance with full Australian\nAccounting Standards was only available to non-reporting entities in the preparation of financial statements\nthat are not general purpose financial statements. The financial statements of non-reporting entities are\nclassified as special purpose financial statements and, like general purpose financial statements, are subject\nto true and fair view requirements of the Corporations Act where they fall within the scope of that Act.  \n1 This definition is included in paragraph Aus7.2 of AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements.  \n2 Under Sections 292(2), 293 and 294 of the Corporations Act, small proprietary companies must prepare and lodge financial reports in\ncertain circumstances such as when the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) directs them, or they are controlled\nby a foreign company, or 5% of shareholders vote to have a financial report.  \n-----  BC6 Entities eligible for this reduced reporting burden included those incorporated under the Corporations Act\nthat are not reporting entities but are required to prepare financial statements. Only AASB 101\n_Presentation of Financial Statements, AASB 107_ _Statement of Cash Flows,_ AASB 108 _Accounting_\n_Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, AASB 1031_ _Materiality and AASB 1048_\n_Interpretation of Standards_ apply to such entities, by virtue of the application paragraphs in those\nStandards.  \nBC7 The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has expressed the view[3] that non-reporting\nentities required to prepare financial statements in accordance with Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act\nshould comply with the recognition and measurement requirements of all accounting standards. Under\nASIC\u2019s view, the only \u2018relief\u2019 for these entities is not having to apply the disclosure requirements contained\nin Standards other than AASB 101, AASB 107 and AASB 108.  \nBC8 In addition to AASB pronouncements that incorporate IFRSs, there are Australian Accounting Standards\n(including Interpretations) that apply specifically to some or all NFP entities, including:  \n(a) AASB 1004 Contributions;  \n(b) AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting;  \n(c) AASB 1050 Administered Items;  \n(d) AASB 1051 Land Under Roads;  \n(e) AASB 1052 Disaggregated Disclosures; and  \n(f) AASB Interpretation 1038 _Contributions by Owners Made to Wholly-owned Public Sector_\n_Entities._  \nBC9 Prior to AASB 1053, entities not incorporated under the Corporations Act, (which include many NFP\nentities and most public sector entities), were required to apply, where applicable, the recognition,\nmeasurement, presentation and disclosure requirements of these and other Australian Accounting Standards\nif they were reporting entities or holding out financial statements to be general purpose financial statements.",

        "page_content=": "## The Need to Review the Differential Reporting Framework  \nBC10 The Board identified a number of concerns with the differential reporting framework that existed prior to\nAASB 1053. These concerns included that:  \n(a) costs of preparing general purpose financial statements for some entities were greater than\nbenefits for the users of those general purpose financial statements, because the framework\nresulted in requirements for general purpose financial statements that were overly burdensome for\nmany entities; and  \n(b) user needs were not being satisfied for other entities, because the framework was being applied in\na way that some entities (which should prepare general purpose financial statements) were being\ntreated as non-reporting entities and preparing only special purpose financial statements.  \nBC11 When it was initially considering these concerns, the Board noted that the International Accounting\nStandards Board (IASB) was developing an IFRS for SMEs that would result in general purpose financial\nstatements that would not be compliant with IFRSs. Accordingly, the Board decided that, in revising its\ndifferential reporting framework, it was appropriate for the Board to also consider requirements for general\npurpose financial statements that differ from (full) Australian Accounting Standards. The Financial\nReporting Council has been kept apprised of these developments.  \nBC12 The Board issued a number of consultative documents containing its proposals for addressing the concerns\nnoted in paragraph BC10. These documents were, in sequence:  \n(a) Invitation to Comment ITC 12 _Request for Comment on a Proposed Revised Differential_\n_Reporting Regime for Australia and IASB Exposure Draft of A Proposed IFRS for Small and_\n_Medium-sized Entities \u2013 issued in May 2007;_  \n(b) Consultation Paper _Differential Financial Reporting \u2013 Reducing Disclosure Requirements (A_\n_Proposed Reduced Disclosure Regime for Non-publicly Accountable For-profit Private Sector_\n_Entities and Certain Entities in the Not-for-profit Private Sector and Public Sector)_ \u2013 issued in\nFebruary 2010; and  \n(c) Exposure Draft ED 192 Differential Reporting Framework \u2013 also issued in February 2010.  \n3 ASIC Regulatory Guide 85 Reporting requirements for non-reporting entities.  \n-----  BC13 These consultative documents contained proposals relating to both of the concerns (a) and (b) noted in\nparagraph BC10 above. The Board refined its ITC 12 proposals in the light of comments it received on the\nITC, and reflected its revised proposals in the Consultation Paper and accompanying ED 192. After\nconsidering constituent comments on ED 192, the Board decided to issue AASB 1053 in response to\nconcern (a), and to undertake further research prior to deciding how it would deal with concern (b).  \nBC14 In relation to concern (b), many constituents agreed with the manner in which the Board proposed to\naddress the concern, which was to change the focus from reporting entity to general purpose financial\nstatements and clarify the meaning of general purpose financial statements in an Australian context. This\nwas on the grounds that:  \n(a) the application of reporting entity involves a high degree of subjectivity and the term is open to\ndiffering interpretations; and  \n(b) the use of reporting entity for differential reporting is not universally understood.  \nThis group was of the view that the use of the reporting entity concept does not provide the intended result,\nand the uncertainty surrounding its application reduces its usefulness as a robust criterion for differential\nreporting purposes.  \nBC15 In contrast, other constituents expressed the view that the concept of reporting entity works well and should\nbe retained as one aspect of differential reporting. They commented that they have not seen evidence of\nmajor problems with its application. This group, therefore, considered that those entities that currently\nclaim to be non-reporting entities and prepare special purpose financial statements do not have dependent\nusers and the evidence does not support a view that there is a systemic problem with reporting entities\nclaiming a non-reporting entity status to evade their reporting responsibilities under Australian Accounting\nStandards.  \nBC16 The Board concluded that, in the light of these contrasting claims, further research should be carried out on\nthe impact of the ED 192 proposals on those entities currently preparing special purpose financial\nstatements. This is primarily with a view to ensuring that those entities currently appropriately preparing\nspecial purpose financial statements are not disadvantaged by the proposals. Consistent with this, the Board\ndecided that, under the first stage of revisions to the differential reporting framework, concern (a) should be\naddressed. The Board\u2019s approach to dealing with concern (a) leaves the current differential reporting\nframework based on the reporting entity concept and general purpose financial statements intact, including\nthe requirement for entities required to prepare financial reports in accordance with Part 2M.3 of the\nCorporations Act to apply AASB 101, AASB 107, AASB 108, AASB 1031 and AASB 1048, by virtue of\nthe application paragraphs in those Standards.  \nBC17 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions focuses on the basis for the Board\u2019s conclusions relating to\nconcern (a).",

        "page_content=": "## Different Tiers of Requirements for General Purpose Financial Statements  \nBC18 The Board decided to retain full IFRSs as adopted in Australia as the first Tier (Tier 1) of reporting\nrequirements, and make it mandatory for a relatively small number of entities in the private and public\nsectors in their preparation of general purpose financial statements. These entities are limited to publicly\naccountable entities in the for-profit private sector and Governments in the public sector (see paragraphs\nBC25 and BC52). Accordingly, AASB 1053 does not reduce the reporting burden of those entities.\nRetention of full IFRSs as adopted in Australia requirements for these entities is consistent with the\napproach adopted by the IASB to require certain entities to continue to comply with full IFRSs in order to\nclaim IFRS compliance.  \nBC19 The Board decided to introduce a second Tier (Tier 2) of requirements to substantially reduce the burden of\nfinancial reporting for other entities in both the private and public sectors in their preparation of general\npurpose financial statements. Tier 2 retains the recognition, measurement and presentation requirements[4] of\nfull IFRSs as adopted in Australia, but requires disclosures that are substantially reduced when compared\nwith those required under full IFRSs as adopted in Australia.  \nBC20 The Board regards AASB 1053 as a pragmatic and substantive response to the need to reduce the burden of\ndisclosure requirements on Australian reporting entities. However, the Board does not regard it as a\ncomplete or final answer to that need. In addition to the further research referred to in paragraph BC16\nabove, the Board intends continuing its deliberations on revising the differential reporting framework with a  \n4 Except for presentation of a third balance sheet required under Tier 1.  \n-----  view to ongoing improvements (including having regard to decisions made by the IASB in relation to its\n_IFRS for SMEs \u2013 see paragraph BC98). The Board concluded that the reforms in AASB 1053 should not be_\ndelayed while consideration of other possible areas of reform continues. The Board notes that important\nreforms are also being considered to reduce the complexity of full IFRSs, including in the area of financial\ninstruments, which would help reduce reporting complexities when adopted in Australia, including for\nentities that would be subject to Tier 1 requirements. The IASB is expected to move beyond financial\ninstruments in its efforts to simplify requirements and the AASB will continue to encourage and support\nthose efforts.  \nBC21 The new Tier 2 requirements do not change the current AASB policy of the same transactions and other\nevents being subject to the same accounting requirements to the extent feasible (that is, transaction\nneutrality), for all entities preparing general purpose financial statements (whether for-profit or NFP).  \nBC22 The Board considered whether a third tier of reporting requirements for general purpose financial\nstatements should be introduced to provide simpler financial reporting requirements for smaller NFP\nentities since those entities might find the adoption of Tier 2 requirements overly burdensome on costbenefit grounds. The Board noted that many NFP entities in the private sector are established as companies\nlimited by guarantee under the Corporations Act or as associations under relevant Incorporated Associations\nActs in each State and Territory. Moreover, many non-trading cooperatives are regulated by State or\nTerritory Acts. Having regard to this legislation, the Board noted that a reason for contemplating the need\nfor a third tier was that there is generally no NFP equivalent to the outright exemption from reporting that\nexists for small proprietary companies (see paragraph BC4 above).  \nBC23 The Board noted that while there is some support from constituents for creating a third tier, there are\ndifferent views about the requirements of such a tier and the way entities applying those requirements\nshould be identified. The Board also considered the proposals for reporting relief in the Discussion Paper\npublished by the Australian Government in June 2007 titled _Financial Reporting by Unlisted Public_\n_Companies in relation to the creation of a third tier of reporting requirements for companies limited by_\nguarantee[5].  \nBC24 The Board decided not to introduce a third tier of reporting requirements on the basis that:  \n(a) the Government intended to alleviate the reporting burden of small companies limited by\nguarantee through amendments to the Corporations Act; and  \n(b) Tier 2 requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements would help reduce the\ndisclosure burden of NFP entities significantly.",

        "page_content=": "## Applicability of the Different Tiers to For-Profit Entities  \n### Public Accountability\nBC25 The Board concluded that for-profit entities that are publicly accountable (as defined in _International_\n_Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities [IFRS for SMEs]) should be required to_\napply full IFRSs as adopted in Australia. This is on the basis of consistency with international reporting\nrequirements in the for-profit private sector. The Board noted that, since Australia has adopted full IFRSs,\nit would be logical to use the public accountability notion used by the IASB in determining which entities in\nthe for-profit sector should apply Australian Accounting Standards in full.  \nBC26 The Board acknowledged constituents\u2019 comments about some aspects of the definition of public\naccountability that the application of the definition in some cases may involve interpretation or judgement.\nSome respondents to ED 192 noted it would be helpful for the Board to clarify certain terms used in the\ndefinition. These include the term \u2018public market\u2019 referred to in the first leg of the definition and the terms\n\u2018fiduciary\u2019, \u2018broad\u2019, \u2018outsiders\u2019 and \u2018primary business\u2019 referred to in the second leg of the definition.\nHowever, the Board noted it is not a policy of the Board to further interpret the IASB\u2019s terms and\ndefinitions. Accordingly, the Board decided that, instead of interpreting the terms in the definition, AASB\n1053 should identify entities that the Board deems to be publicly accountable in the Australian context, to\nsupplement the IASB\u2019s definition of public accountability (see Appendix B of AASB 1053).  \nBC27 In relation to identifying entities that should be deemed to be publicly accountable in the Australian context,\nsome respondents to ED 192 questioned whether captive insurers should be classified as publicly\naccountable since, in their view, there is unlikely to be a broad group of outsiders involved. The Board\nnoted that the nature of captive insurers varies. Some only provide insurance to subsidiaries within their  \n5 The outcome of the proposals in the Discussion Paper are included in the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Reporting Reform) Act\n_2010._  \n-----  group while others also insure joint venture businesses. Some captive insurers, such as association captive\ninsurers, can insure a wide range of members. Those that provide insurance to subsidiaries within groups\nmay also deal with outsiders. For example, they may offer products that have public beneficiaries (such as\npublic or product liability, or professional indemnity).  \nBC28 The Board concluded that, whilst it expects that most insurance companies will be publicly accountable,\nthere may be certain general insurers, such as some captive insurers, that may not be publicly accountable.\nAccordingly, the Board did not deem all regulated insurance entities as publicly accountable.  \nBC29 Some respondents to ED 192 also questioned whether Small Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\n(APRA) Funds (SAFs) should be deemed to be publicly accountable, given the small number of members\nand the limited users of their financial statements.  \nBC30 The Board noted that SAFs are usually similar in size to self-managed super funds (SMSFs) but, unlike\nSMSFs (which are regulated by the Australian Taxation Office [ATO]), are regulated by APRA because\nthey do not meet all conditions to be a SMSF. The Board noted there may be users (such as regulators and\ntrustees) of the financial statements of SAFs who can command information they need and the outsiders for\nwhom the SAF holds assets in a fiduciary capacity. Accordingly, those users do not seem to constitute a\nbroad group and the Board decided not to deem SAFs as publicly accountable.  \nBC31 Furthermore, some respondents questioned whether all entities holding an Australian Financial Services\nLicence (AFSL) would meet the definition of publicly accountable.  \nBC32 The Board noted that AFSL holders undertake a range of activities and are a diverse group of entities. The\nBoard concluded that whether an AFSL holder is publicly accountable depends on the circumstances,\nincluding the nature of the services they provide. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for the Board to\ndeem AFSL holders as publicly accountable or not publicly accountable.",

It noted that, although there are some who argue that the IASB definition of\npublic accountability may cover some NFP entities on the grounds that they hold funds in a fiduciary\ncapacity for a broad group of outsiders, the IASB definition has a for-profit context that makes it unsuitable\nfor the NFP sector.  \nBC43 The Board also considered using a modified definition of public accountability in the NFP sector context.\nThe Board noted the disparate views among constituents about whether such a notion can effectively be\nmodified and used to identify entities falling under different reporting Tiers in the NFP sector.  \nBC44 The Board noted that some constituents believe that the level of public accountability, for example, for each\ncharity, depends on a number of entity-specific factors, which reduce the usefulness of \u2018public  \n-----  accountability\u2019 as a stand-alone criterion for differential reporting purposes in the NFP sector. Some\nconstituents argued that the degree of public accountability of a charity has a direct relationship to the\nfollowing.  \n(a) Sources of funds: for example, if the sources of funds are public donations (particularly those\nthat are tax deductible by the donor) or government grants, then a high degree of public\naccountability is expected. Voluntary labour may be regarded as a form of donation and,\ntherefore, a high degree of public accountability might be expected when significant voluntary\nlabour is involved. Generally the level of public accountability is high where public funds are\ninvolved, such as when community or social activities are carried out on behalf of government.\nHowever, when the source of funds is an individual or a corporation, a much lower degree of\npublic accountability is expected on the basis that the individual or corporation involved can\nprobably access the financial information they need. A moderate level of public accountability\nmay be envisaged when the sources of funds are grants from foundations or sponsors.  \n(b) _Number of stakeholders in the entity: the wider the spectrum of stakeholders, the higher the_\nexpected level of public accountability.  \n(c) _Scale of operations and geographical coverage: generally charities active at the national or_\ninternational level are seen as being publicly accountable at a high level.  \nBC45 The Board concluded that a modified definition of public accountability in the NFP private sector context\nwould not provide a robust basis for identifying entities falling under different reporting Tiers since NFP\nprivate sector entities, (with the likely exception of smaller member-based entities), are typically seen as\nhaving differing degrees of public accountability in the general sense of the term.  \nBC46 The Board reached a similar conclusion about whether a definition of public accountability could provide a\nrobust basis for identifying NFP public sector entities falling under different reporting Tiers. This is on the\nbasis that these entities are regarded as publicly accountable in the general sense of the term.",

However,\nother respondents were concerned about using size thresholds, citing the following reasons:  \n(a) size thresholds are arbitrary;  \n(b) size thresholds will become outdated over time; and  \n(c) particularly in the public sector, unless jurisdiction-specific thresholds are prescribed, it would\nlead to similar entities applying different requirements across different State and Territory\njurisdictions.  \nBC49 There were also differences of view between respondents as to the amounts of the appropriate thresholds.\nSome thought the thresholds noted in paragraph BC47 are too low and should be raised to be comparable to\n\u2018important\u2019 entity thresholds contemplated for the for-profit sector noted in paragraph BC33. Others\nthought the thresholds being contemplated are too high, which would mean that too few NFP entities would\napply full IFRSs as adopted in Australia.

The Board noted commentators\u2019 views on ITC 14 Proposed\n_Definition and Guidance for Not-for-Profit Entities that NFP entities can generally be identified as being in_\none of three categories based on the nature of their operations and sources of funding:  \n(a) charities;  \n(b) member-based entities; and  \n(c) public sector entities;  \nand that there may be a need for a fourth \u2018other\u2019 category to cater for entities such as schools and religious\norganisations. The Board noted the significant disparities in the size of entities within each of the above\ncategories.  \nBC56 Some constituents argued that the disclosures required by full IFRSs (or the _IFRS for SMEs) would not_\nsatisfy the information needs of users of financial statements of, for example, charities. These Standards, it\nwas noted, have a for-profit focus while the nature of charities\u2019 activities is such that not all disclosures in\nthese Standards are pertinent to the needs of users of the financial statements of charities. Moreover, there\nare disclosures that relate to the nature of operations of charities and specific issues of public interest that  \n-----  are not required by these Standards and that may be within the scope of financial reporting. It was argued\nthat the stakeholders of a charity are interested in the accountability of the entity in achieving objectives\nstated in the entity\u2019s mission statement using funds provided by those stakeholders. They noted that donors,\ngrantors and other contributors who provide resources in the form of money or voluntary services and the\npublic at large (which includes the beneficiaries of charitable activity) are all interested in the accountability\nof charities.  \nBC57 The Board noted that a similar view exists in regard to all NFP entities. This view links accountability to\nthe objective of each NFP entity and advocates disclosure of particular performance-related information to\nhelp inform a wide range of stakeholders about the way a NFP entity is utilising its resources in achieving\nits purpose.  \nBC58 The Board decided that there should not be subclassifications of different types of entities in the NFP sector\nother than between private and public sector entities, for differential reporting purposes. In arriving at this\ndecision, the Board noted that:  \n(a) in a transaction-neutral reporting environment, subclassifications should not make a reporting\ndifference as far as the recognition and measurement of transactions are concerned; and  \n(b) a choice between Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements would provide different levels of disclosures\nappropriate for entities with different levels of activities.  \nBC59 The Board noted that its conclusion on this matter does not rule out specific projects directed at particular\ntypes of NFP entities and decided that its separate project on Disclosures by Private Sector Not-for-Profit\nEntities should be the vehicle through which it determines whether disclosures in addition to those required\nby full IFRSs as adopted in Australia should be required of Tier 1 or Tier 2 NFP entities.

The Board noted regulators may\ndevelop their own size thresholds to identify those entities about which there would be sufficient interest to\njustify applying Tier 1 requirements. To arrive at consistent results, the Board noted it might be appropriate\nto use a number of different size indicators such as total assets, revenue, and number of employees as the\nbasis for thresholds.",

If such subsidiaries are not\nthemselves publicly accountable but apply full IFRSs (as they are already applying full IFRS\nrecognition and measurement for consolidation purposes), they are required to disclose\ninformation that is onerous to prepare and is often of no benefit to users. If they were to adopt the\n_IFRS for SMEs as proposed, they could choose to refer to a full IFRS for an option that is not_\nincluded in the _IFRS for SMEs. However, they are then required to follow the disclosure_\nrequirements of that full IFRS. A stand-alone _IFRS for SMEs that includes only the absolute_\nminimum necessary disclosures, more topics and more of the treatment options from full IFRSs\nmay alleviate the problem. However, it seems likely that subsidiaries within large groups would  \n-----  be involved in a wider range of activities and transactions than an equivalent SME that is not part\nof a group. Accordingly, it may be necessary for the IASB to consider permitting subsidiaries of\npublicly accountable entities to prepare general purpose financial statements by applying all the\nrecognition and measurement requirements of full IFRSs, but permitting reduced disclosures\nsimilar to those required by the IFRS for SMEs.  \nBC72 However, the IFRS for SMEs, published in July 2009, did not address many of the Australian constituents\u2019\nconcerns. The _IFRS for SMEs changes some of the full IFRS recognition and measurement accounting_\npolicy options by mandating or eliminating a particular option or introducing \u2018new\u2019 options. That means\nsome of the full IFRS recognition and measurement accounting policy options are not available to SMEs\nand there are some that differ from comparable full IFRS recognition and measurement requirements.  \nBC73 The AASB discussed the IFRS for SMEs with a view to assessing its suitability as Tier 2 requirements. The\nAASB noted that there are concerns about adopting the _IFRS for SMEs in Australia for the following_\nreasons:  \n(a) some of the accounting policy options that have been removed would be the favoured accounting\npolicies for many Australian entities;  \n(b) changes to full IFRS recognition and measurement requirements under the IFRS for SMEs and the\nabsence of some accounting policy options from the IFRS for SMEs would force subsidiaries to\nadjust accounting policies for consolidation purposes when parents apply full IFRSs;  \n(c) entities applying the _IFRS for SMEs would be deprived of improvements and simplifications as_\nthey become available at the full IFRS level because the IASB has stated that it will only update\nthe IFRS for SMEs once there have been two years of broad adoption and, thereafter, every three\nyears;  \n(d) possible benefits that might result from comparability with overseas entities applying the _IFRS_\n_for SMEs would:_  \n(i) depend on how widely adopted it becomes;  \n(ii) be limited because entities seeking to access international capital markets would\ngenerally apply full IFRSs; and  \n(iii) be mitigated due to a loss of comparability across all types of entities\u2019 general purpose\nfinancial statements within Australia;  \n(e) having different streams of recognition and measurement requirements involves different streams\nof knowledge, such that education and training at the tertiary level and within the accounting\nprofession would become more costly;  \n(f) there would be start up costs because entities preparing general purpose financial statements have\nalready made the effort to apply full IFRSs;  \n(g) adoption of the _IFRS for SMEs may be seen as a retrograde step in a country that has already_\nadopted full IFRS recognition and measurement accounting policy options;  \n(h) the actual changes in recognition and measurement requirements in the IFRS for SMEs would not\nproduce any real economies for Australian SMEs; and  \n(i) in the event that an entity moves to, or from, full IFRSs, there would be costs involved in\nmigrating from the recognition and measurement requirements of one Tier of reporting to\nanother.  \nBC74 The Board concluded that the IFRS for SMEs is not presently a suitable set of requirements for Tier 2 in\nAustralia. However, the Board decided it will continue to monitor and contribute to further changes in the\n_IFRS for SMEs and that it is open to the possibility of adopting the_ _IFRS for SMEs in future should the_\nchanges in that Standard make it practicable in an integrated for-profit/NFP sector reporting environment.  \nBC75 The Board noted that the introduction of the RDR as Tier 2 is supported by a majority of respondents to\nED 192 who have also provided reasons for not supporting the adoption of the IFRS for SMEs as Tier 2 in\nplace of the RDR or as an alternative alongside it.",

        "page_content=": "## Approach to Determining Disclosure Requirements under the RDR  \nBC76 In determining the RDR, the Board sought to balance the need to reduce disclosures with the need to satisfy\nthe objective of general purpose financial statements. From amongst a number of possible approaches to\ndetermining disclosure requirements under the RDR, the Board decided to adopt an approach that:  \n-----  (a) draws on the _IFRS for SMEs to identify disclosures in cases where the recognition and_\nmeasurement accounting policy options available or requirements under the RDR align with those\nunder the IFRS for SMEs; and  \n(b) applies \u2018user need\u2019 and \u2018cost-benefit\u2019 principles (that is, the same basic principles used by the\nIASB in determining disclosures under the _IFRS for SMEs) to arrive at reduced disclosure_\nrequirements in cases where the recognition and measurement accounting policy options or\nrequirements under the RDR differ from those under the IFRS for SMEs.  \nIn applying this approach, the Board concluded that satisfying the objective of general purpose financial\nstatements should be the overriding basis for determining the disclosures under the RDR whether or not the\nrecognition and measurement accounting policy options available or required under that regime align with\nthose provided under the IFRS for SMEs. The Board applied this approach to each disclosure requirement\nin each Australian Accounting Standard. The results are reflected in AASB 2010-2.  \nBC77 The Board noted that its approach would help minimise the cost of determining and maintaining disclosures\nunder the RDR.  \nBC78 Consistent with the IASB\u2019s approach in the _IFRS for SMEs, the AASB concluded that users of general_\npurpose financial statements of non-publicly accountable for-profit entities are particularly interested in\ninformation about:  \n(a) short-term cash flows and about obligations, commitments or contingencies, whether or not\nrecognised as liabilities;  \n(b) liquidity and solvency;  \n(c) measurement uncertainties;  \n(d) the entity\u2019s accounting policy choices;  \n(e) disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements; and  \n(f) transactions and other events and conditions encountered by such entities.  \nBC79 The Board also concluded that, in addition to the particular information needs of users of non-publicly\naccountable for-profit entities noted in paragraph BC78, the information needs of the users of general\npurpose financial statements of NFP entities in both the private and public sectors would be satisfied by\nadopting a similar approach, having regard to the specific needs of users of NFP, including public sector,\nentity financial statements. The AASB uses its Process for Modifying IFRSs for PBE/NFP in assessing the\nneed for specific requirements relating to NFP entities.  \nBC80 The Board noted that, although the IFRS for SMEs has been developed to apply to for-profit private sector\nentities, broadly it is considered reasonable to rely on the judgements made in developing the _IFRS for_\n_SMEs in respect of both for-profit and NFP (including public sector) entities in Australia given that IFRSs_\nare generally applied to all types of Australian entities.",

        "page_content=": "## Application of Standards  \nBC81 AASB 2010-2 specifies the disclosures in each Australian Accounting Standard from which Tier 2 entities\nare exempted. However, some Standards are equally applicable to both Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities.\nAccordingly, such Standards do not provide reduced disclosures for Tier 2 entities. Examples are AASB 4\n_Insurance Contracts and AASB 1004 Contributions._  \nBC82 Some Standards apply only to Tier 1 entities, but Tier 2 entities may elect to use them. Examples are\nAASB 8 _Operating Segments and AASB 133_ _Earnings per Share, which generally apply only to entities_\nthat access public capital markets, as stated in their application paragraphs.  \nBC83 AASB 134 _Interim Financial Reporting_ applies to disclosing entities\u2019 half-year financial statements.\nConsistent with the Board\u2019s approach to other Standards in respect of annual general purpose financial\nstatements, other Tier 1 entities and Tier 2 entities that elect to prepare interim general purpose financial\nstatements would be required to apply AASB 134 (which specifies reduced disclosure requirements under\nTier 2), by virtue of the application paragraph in that Standard.  \nBC84 Entities applying AASB 134 may prepare condensed interim financial statements or present a complete set\nof financial statements as interim financial statements. Tier 2 entities are exempted from some disclosures\nwhen preparing condensed financial statements and would apply Tier 2 requirements in AASB 101 when\npreparing a complete set of financial statements as their interim financial statements.  \nBC85 There are also Standards that are only applicable to Tier 1 entities, and Tier 2 entities cannot elect to apply\nthem in preparing financial statements. These Standards are identified by virtue of their application  \n-----  paragraphs. Currently the only example is AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General Government_\n_Sector Financial Reporting._  \nBC86 In considering possible reductions in disclosure requirements of:  \n(a) AASB 4 _Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023_ _General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038_ _Life_\n_Insurance Contracts for insurers that might not be publicly accountable, such as potentially some_\ncaptive insurers (see paragraphs BC27-BC28); and  \n(b) AAS 25 Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans for superannuation plans that might not be\npublicly accountable, such as SAFs (see paragraphs BC29-BC30);  \nthe Board noted that such decisions should be made after applying further due process, including public\nexposure of proposed reductions. This is because ED 192 did not include proposed reduced disclosures for\nAASB 4, AASB 1023, AASB 1038 and AAS 25. In particular, the Board considered it would need to\nconsult widely about whether some life insurers could be given relief from disclosures under AASB 1038\nbecause the Board\u2019s initial view is that life insurance is of high public interest and comprehensive\ninformation on life insurance is needed by users of general purpose financial statements.  \nBC87 The Board noted that, until the above due process is completed, all insurers and superannuation plans\npreparing general purpose financial statements would continue to apply these Standards in full.\nAccordingly, if there are any Tier 2 insurers or superannuation plans preparing general purpose financial\nstatements, the only benefits of reduced disclosure requirements available to them would be through the\nreduced disclosures in other Standards.",

        "page_content=": "## Transition  \nBC88 The Board considered the transitional requirements for entities adopting Tier 2 requirements for the first\ntime and moving between Tiers. The Board identified three main scenarios for transition that should be\ndealt with in AASB 1053:  \n(a) transition by an entity that prepared its most recent previous financial statements in the form of\nspecial purpose financial statements to Tier 1 or Tier 2;  \n(b) transition by an entity applying Tier 1 to Tier 2; and  \n(c) transition by an entity applying Tier 2 to Tier 1.  \nBC89 The Board noted that, for transitioning from special purpose financial statements to general purpose\nfinancial statements, an assessment of whether the preparer has applied recognition and measurement\nrequirements in its most recent previous financial statements is of paramount importance. Accordingly, an\nentity that has applied recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards\nselectively or not at all in its special purpose financial statements should be treated differently from one that\nhas applied the recognition and measurement requirements of applicable Australian Accounting Standards,\nincluding those of AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC90 AASB 1 includes disclosure requirements. Entities transitioning from special purpose financial statements\nto Tier 2 are exempted from some of the disclosure requirements in that Standard, using the principles\napplied in determining disclosures under Tier 2 (see paragraph BC78).  \nBC91 Entities transitioning from Tier 1 to Tier 2 would not apply AASB 1. However, entities transitioning from\nTier 2 to Tier 1 would need to apply AASB 1 in full to claim compliance with IFRSs, as under Tier 2 they\nwould only have applied some of the disclosure requirements of AASB 1. This is consistent with the\nBoard\u2019s policy that for-profit entities complying with Australian Accounting Standards simultaneously\ncomply with IFRSs.  \nBC92 Entities that transition to Tier 1 need to apply AASB 1 in full in order to be able to claim compliance with\nIFRSs, in accordance with AASB 101, including making an unreserved statement of compliance as required\nby AASB 101.  \nBC93 The Board considered whether entities transitioning between Tiers for which compliance with IFRSs is not\npertinent, in particular NFP entities that are subject to Aus paragraphs, should be subject to AASB 1 on\ntransition. The Board concluded that AASB 1 is not applicable in those circumstances because, at the time\nof transition between Tiers, Australian Accounting Standards or Australian Accounting Standards \u2013\nReduced Disclosure Requirements, which have common recognition and measurement requirements, have\npreviously been complied with. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to imply, through application of\nAASB 1, that the basis of accounting has changed.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Operative Date  \nBC94 The Board concluded that mandatory application of Tier 2 requirements should be annual reporting periods\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2013. The Board noted a long transitional period is particularly required to\nallow entities that prepare special purpose financial statements to make necessary preparations for\ntransitioning to Tier 2 requirements should they choose to prepare general purpose financial statements\nunder Tier 2. The Board considered it would be beneficial to have a relatively long transition period to\nallow these entities to prepare their internal reporting systems for transition.  \nBC95 However, the Board decided to allow early adoption of Tier 2 requirements for those entities that want to\navail themselves of the reduced disclosure requirements under that Tier before the mandatory application\ndate of 1 July 2013. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods that begin on or after\n1 July 2009 but before 1 July 2013. The Board decided not to permit early adoption for annual reporting\nperiods that begin before 1 July 2009 due to the difficulty of identifying relevant Standards applying to\nthose earlier periods and making consistent judgments as to which disclosures in those Standards would be\napplicable under Tier 2.  \nBC96 The Board also noted that a long transition period would potentially enable any outcome of the second stage\nof the project to be made operative from the same date as the first stage, to facilitate minimal disruption on\ntransition. The Board will not decide whether the second stage should be progressed until the results of the\nresearch project it has commissioned are known.  \nBC97 The transition period is also consistent with the Board\u2019s normal policy regarding transition periods for its\nStandards. The Board concluded that making Tier 2 requirements mandatory from the date of issue of\nrelevant Standards may inappropriately require entities that currently apply Tier 1 to select that Tier and\nmake disclosures related to that selection rather than continue their current accounting disclosures that\ncomply with current GAAP.",

Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors\nthan to others.  \nBC2 In June 2012 the Board issued AASB 2012-5 Amendments to _Australian Accounting Standards arising from_\n_Annual Improvements 2009\u20132011 Cycle incorporating the IASB Standard Annual Improvements to_\nIFRSs 2009\u20132011 Cycle. The amendments AASB 2012-5 made to AASB 1 _First-time Adoption of_\n_Australian Accounting Standards relate to an entity returning to Australian Accounting Standards that_\npreviously applied Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs, but in its most recent previous annual\nfinancial statements did not include an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with Australian\nAccounting Standards or IFRSs. Irrespective of whether AASB 1 has previously been applied, the\namendments permit such an entity to apply AASB 1, or the option under AASB 1 to apply Australian\nAccounting Standards retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in_\n_Accounting Estimates and Errors as if the entity had never stopped applying Australian Accounting_\nStandards or IFRSs. Additional disclosure requirements were also specified in the amendments.  \nBC3 At its May 2013 meeting the Board noted that these AASB 1 amendments have implications for AASB\n1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards (June 2010). Accordingly, the Board decided\nto clarify some of the existing requirements in, and propose introducing new requirements into, AASB 1053\n(June 2010).  \nBC4 Subsequently, the Board issued Exposure Draft (ED) 248 _Amendments to AASB 1053 \u2013 Transition to and_\n_between Tiers, and related Tier 2 Disclosure Requirements in March 2014 for comment by 19 May 2014._\nTwo written submissions were received. One submission expressed concern about the loss of reconciliation\ninformation that would result from the proposals (see paragraph BC20 below). The other submission\nexpressed concern about the complexity of the proposals (see paragraph BC5 below).  \nBC5 In relation to the latter concern, the respondent did not support certain aspects of the proposals in ED 248\nand recommended simplifying the transition rules such that AASB 1 is always required to be applied when\nan entity transitions from special purpose financial statements (SPFSs) to Tier 2 general purpose financial\nstatements (GPFSs), even if the entity previously applied applicable recognition and measurement\nrequirements. Moreover, the respondent suggested simplifying the transition rules such that AASB 1 is\nalways required to be applied when an entity transitions to Tier 1 GPFSs, even if the entity does not intend\nto comply with IFRSs.  \nBC6 The Board considered that while the respondent\u2019s suggestions might simplify requirements by increasing\nthe number of scenarios where AASB 1 would be required to be applied, the consideration and application\nof AASB 1 would not necessarily be a simplification for particular entities.  \nBC7 Accordingly, the Board decided not to make any substantive changes to the proposals in ED 248 when\nprogressing to the final Standard AASB 2014-2, the basis for which is explained in paragraphs BC8-BC25\nbelow.",

        "page_content=": "## Reapplication of Tier 1 Reporting Requirements that does not entail Transition from Tier 2  \nBC10 The Board noted that amendments made to AASB 1 in June 2012 by AASB 2012-5, referred to in\nparagraph BC2 above, introduced an option for entities returning to Australian Accounting Standards or\nIFRSs. An entity can either:  \n(a) apply AASB 1 (including all of its disclosure requirements); or  \n(b) apply Australian Accounting Standards[1] retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 (as if the\nentity had never stopped applying Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs), with some\nassociated disclosures.  \nBC11 The Board noted that AASB 1 provides exceptions from applying some of the normal Tier 1 reporting\nrequirements retrospectively on the basis that the cost of retrospectively applying some Tier 1 requirements\nwould be likely to exceed the benefits to users of financial statements. However, the amendments made\nthrough AASB 2012-5 acknowledge that the costs of applying AASB 1 without recourse to the AASB 108\noption in AASB 1 might exceed the benefits of doing so for an entity that had previously applied Tier 1\nrequirements. In particular, the AASB 2012-5 amendments allow an entity resuming the application of\nTier 1 reporting requirements to do so using the more cost-beneficial approach. In applying the AASB 108\noption in AASB 1, an entity would apply Tier 1 requirements retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108\nas if the entity had never stopped applying Tier 1 requirements.  \nBC12 However, the Board decided there should be a restriction in relation to the use of the AASB 1 option for\nretrospective application in accordance with AASB 108 in the Australian financial reporting environment.\nThis arises because compliance with Tier 1 reporting requirements does not translate into compliance with\nIFRSs in all cases. For example, a not-for-profit entity applying AASB 1004 Contributions would apply\nrecognition and measurement requirements that are different from those under IFRSs. Accordingly, the\nBoard decided that an entity that is to claim IFRS compliance on resuming Tier 1 reporting requirements,\nbut which was not previously IFRS compliant (i.e. it is effectively becoming IFRS compliant for the first\ntime), would not be able to avail itself of the option in AASB 1 for retrospective application in accordance\nwith AASB 108. Such an entity would apply AASB 1, without recourse to the AASB 108 option in\nAASB 1, on resuming Tier 1 reporting requirements.  \nBC13 The Board observed that the effect of the AASB 2012-5 amendments might be regarded as not having been\nfully reflected in AASB 1053 at the time of making AASB 2012-5. In particular, some considered that\nAASB 1053 needed to be amended to make it clear that entities could apply Australian Accounting\nStandards retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 in the circumstances described in\nparagraphs BC11-BC12 above. Accordingly, the Board concluded it should make the clarification by\nreplacing paragraph 19 of AASB 1053 (June 2010) with paragraphs 19 and 19A.",

Consistent with this prohibition, the\nBoard decided to clarify in paragraphs 19B and 20[2] of AASB 1053 that an entity that has applied Tier 2\nreporting requirements in a previous reporting period, but whose most recent previous annual financial\nstatements did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with those requirements, and\nthe entity continued to apply all applicable recognition and measurement requirements, should also be\nprohibited from applying AASB 1 (and the AASB 108 option in AASB 1), on resuming Tier 2 reporting\nrequirements. This is consistent with the view that it would not be appropriate to imply, through application\nof AASB 1, that the basis of accounting has changed.  \nBC15 The Board also decided to require entities returning to Tier 2 reporting requirements meet the disclosure\nrequirements equivalent to those in paragraph 23A (and, where relevant, paragraph 23B) of AASB 1, which  \n1 It is relevant to note that the term \u2018Australian Accounting Standards\u2019 encompasses both Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements.\n2 Paragraph 20 of AASB 1053 (June 2010) clarified that first-time transitioning to Tier 1 reporting requirements from SPFSs that applied  \napplicable recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards (including those of AASB 1, where relevant)\nwould entail application of the full disclosure requirements of AASB 1. This clarification is no longer needed because paragraph 18 of\nAASB 1 is clear that Tier 1 reporting requirements would apply on first transition, irrespective of the degree of application of\nrecognition and measurement requirements prior to transition.  \n-----  would require an entity to disclose the reason it stopped applying Tier 2 requirements and the reason it is\nresuming reporting in accordance with those requirements (and the reasons it elected to use the AASB 108\noption in AASB 1, where that election is available and adopted).[3] The Board is of the view that these\ndisclosure requirements provide users with useful information and the disclosures in paragraph 23A would\ndiscourage the intentional omission of the statement of compliance with Tier 2 reporting requirements\nsolely to allow an entity to take advantage of the exemptions in AASB 1.  \nBC16 The Board noted, however, that entities returning to Tier 2 reporting requirements in circumstances noted in\nparagraph BC14 above are prohibited from applying AASB 1 and, by extension, they would be exempted\nfrom the disclosures of paragraph 23A (and the disclosures in paragraph 23B would not be applicable).\nAccordingly, to provide relevant information to users, the Board concluded it should amend AASB 1053 to\nrequire the same disclosures as those in paragraph 23A of AASB 1 for entities resuming Tier 2 reporting\nrequirements that are prohibited from applying AASB 1 and the AASB 108 option in AASB 1.",

        "page_content=": "## First-time Application of Tier 2 Reporting Requirements that does not entail Transition from Tier 1  \nBC17 The Board is of the view that entities transitioning to Tier 2 reporting requirements from SPFSs for the first\ntime should not be bound by AASB 1 for first-time application. In some cases it is envisaged that such\nentities might find application of Tier 2 reporting requirements retrospectively in accordance with\nAASB 108 more appropriate on cost-benefit grounds and should, therefore, be able to avail themselves of\nsuch a treatment. Accordingly, consistent with first-time adoption requirements that existed before AASB 1\nwas issued, the Board decided to amend AASB 1053 to permit entities transitioning from SPFSs to Tier 2\nrequirements for the first time to apply those requirements retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108\nwithout going through AASB 1, when and only when an entity had not applied, or only selectively applied,\napplicable recognition and measurement requirements in its most recent SPFSs (see paragraph BC19\nbelow). [In contrast, the Board decided that transition from SPFSs to Tier 1 reporting requirements for the\nfirst time should only be carried out using AASB 1, irrespective of whether an entity intends claiming IFRS\ncompliance, consistent with the Board\u2019s IFRS adoption approach for Tier 1 entities.]  \nBC18 The Board noted the rationale for the prohibition in paragraph 19(a) of the June 2010 version of\nAASB 1053 (see paragraph BC93 of AASB 1053 (June 2010)) for entities that had previously applied all\napplicable recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards from applying\nAASB 1 on first transition to Tier 2 reporting requirements. Consistent with this rationale, the Board\ndecided to amend AASB 1053 to prohibit the same entities from applying Tier 2 reporting requirements\nthrough AASB 1, or retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 on first transition to Tier 2 requirements.\nThose entities would continue to apply the applicable recognition and measurement requirements, whether\nthey had previously initially applied recognition and measurement requirements consistent with AASB 1 or\na predecessor to AASB 108, whichever was applicable at the time.  \nBC19 The Board noted that in some cases entities would not have applied, or only selectively applied, applicable\nrecognition and measurement requirements in preparing their most recent previous annual financial\nstatements. Consistent with the rationale in paragraph BC89 of AASB 1053 (June 2010), the Board\nconcluded that such entities should be treated differently from those that had applied all applicable\nrecognition and measurement requirements in those financial statements. Accordingly, the Board decided\nthat such entities would need to apply AASB 1, or, as explained in paragraph BC17 above, Tier 2 reporting\nrequirements retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108, on first transition to Tier 2 reporting\nrequirements.  \nBC20 The Board noted the concern expressed by one respondent to ED 248 (see paragraph BC4 above) that\nallowing an entity to apply AASB 108 rather than AASB 1 in the circumstances proposed would mean that\nan entity making such an election would not be required to include the type of reconciliation of financial\nstatements that would be required if AASB 1 were to be required to be adopted. The respondent regards the\nreconciliations as useful for in-depth understanding of an entity\u2019s financial statements and obtaining\ncomparative information.  \nBC21 The Board decided that the disclosure requirements in AASB 108 in relation to change of accounting\npolicies provide adequate information to users to understand the nature and effect of changes arising from\nan entity applying Tier 2 requirements for the first time.  \n3 These disclosures would be in addition to any other disclosures required by other Standards (including comparative information in  \naccordance with AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements).  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Optional exemption relating to the measurement of the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures  \nBC5 One subset of entities affected by the removal of SPFS is foreign-controlled proprietary companies.  \nHistorically, many of these entities have prepared SPFS. However, they are required to prepare GPFS for the\nfirst time for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2021.  \nBC6 When preparing their SPFS, these entities may or may not have complied with the recognition and  \nmeasurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards and may or may not have presented\nconsolidated financial statements.  \nBC7 AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards provides transition relief for entities  \ntransitioning from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS. The transition relief allows entities to apply either AASB 1 _First-_\n_time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards or AASB 108_ _Accounting Policies, Changes in_\n_Accounting Estimates and Errors to the transition._  \nBC8 In principle, AASB 1 requires the retrospective application of all Australian Accounting Standards on  \ntransition to Australian Accounting Standards. However, AASB 1 establishes two categories of exceptions\nto this principle:  \n(a) mandatory exceptions that prohibit the retrospective application of some aspects of other\nAustralian Accounting Standards; and  \n(b) optional exemptions from some requirements of other Australian Accounting Standards.  \n-----  BC9 AASB 1 paragraph D16(a) contains an optional exemption that permits a subsidiary that becomes a first\ntime adopter later than its parent to measure its assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts that would be\nincluded in the parent\u2019s consolidated financial statements. However, the exemption in paragraph D16(a)\ncould only be applied where a parent entity has adopted Australian Accounting Standards and not where a\nparent entity has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards or IFRSs). This is the\ncase even where compliance with IFRSs by the parent entity would result in the same outcome as\ncompliance with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC10 In many cases, affected foreign-controlled proprietary entities are subsidiaries of an overseas parent that  \nprepares consolidated financial statements that include information about the entity and comply with IFRSs.  \nBC11 The Board received feedback from stakeholders that being able to use the information included in their  \noverseas parent\u2019s IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements when preparing GPFS for the first time\nwould provide a less costly approach to the transition of such subsidiaries to GPFS. For example:  \n(a) the entity would not need to remeasure its assets and liabilities at its date of transition to\nAustralian Accounting Standards;  \n(b) the entity would not need to apply AASB 1 to any historical business combinations; and  \n(c) the entity would not need to apply Australian Accounting Standards retrospectively where\nrequired by certain Australian Accounting Standards (e.g. AASB 16 _Leases, if a modified_\nretrospective approach to transition is adopted).  \nInstead, the entity would use the information already included in the overseas parent\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements.  \nBC12 Further, in many cases, it is expected that IFRS-compliant information for the entity is already being  \nprepared and possibly audited to assist the overseas parent in preparing its consolidated financial statements.\nIf prepared, this information would be based on the parent\u2019s date of transition to IFRSs. Using this\ninformation would mean the entity would not be required to keep two sets of records \u2013 one based on the\nparent entity\u2019s date of transition to IFRSs for consolidation purposes and another based on the entity\u2019s date\nof transition to Australian Accounting Standards for its own reporting purposes.  \nBC13 The Board observed that when the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) included the optional  \nexemption in IFRS 1 _First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the objective of_\nthe exemption was to eliminate the need for subsidiaries to keep two parallel sets of records, which would be\nburdensome and not beneficial to users. The exemption was also expected to ease some practical problems\nassociated with the transition to IFRSs. The IASB was also of the view that the exemption would not\ndiminish the relevance and reliability of the subsidiary\u2019s financial statements because it permits a\nmeasurement that is already accepted in accordance with IFRSs in the consolidated financial statements of\nthe parent.[1]  \nBC14 The Board considered that the objective of the exemption would still be met if the application of AASB 1  \nparagraph D16(a) was extended to include circumstances where an overseas parent has adopted IFRSs.\nTherefore, ED 315 proposed an amendment to AASB 1 to allow Australian entities to apply the exemption\nin AASB 1 paragraph D16(a) where their parent has adopted either Australian Accounting Standards or\nIFRSs.",

        "page_content=": "## Entities transitioning to consolidated Tier 2 Simplified Disclosures financial statements  \nBC16 Another subset of entities affected by the removal of the reporting entity concept is entities that were  \npreparing unconsolidated GPFS (Tier 2 \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements). That is, the GPFS complied  \n1 IFRS 1 Basis for Conclusions, paragraphs BC59\u2013BC62.  \n-----  with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards without\npresenting consolidated financial statements, in accordance with an exemption in AASB 10. This includes\nsome entities that are classified under Australian taxation legislation as \u201ccountry-by-country reporting\nentities\u201d (CBC entities).  \nBC17 CBC entities are required to prepare GPFS to comply with their CBC reporting obligations to the Australian  \nTaxation Office (ATO). However, some CBC entities that are parent entities maintained they were not\nreporting entities as defined in Australian Accounting Standards and continued to apply the exemption in\nAASB 10 that did not require the presentation of consolidated financial statements if neither the parent\nentity nor the group was such a reporting entity. The Board understands that this approach was\nacknowledged as an available option in ATO guidance.  \nBC18 However, as the \u2018reporting entity\u2019 definition in Australian Accounting Standards no longer applies to certain  \nfor-profit private sector entities, including CBC entities, for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2021, these\nentities can no longer apply the consolidation exemption in AASB 10. Instead, they will be required to\nprepare consolidated financial statements under AASB 10 for the first time.  \nBC19 The Board noted that such entities were not required to present consolidated financial statements in prior  \nperiods as outlined in paragraph BC17. Further, their most recent Tier 2 GPFS complied with all relevant\nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards. The Board acknowledged\nan absence of specific guidance in Australian Accounting Standards for these entities.  \nBC20 However, the Board noted that specific guidance was included in AASB 1053 (paragraph 18A(b)) to  \nexplicitly allow entities that were preparing SPFS on the same basis \u2013 that is, their SPFS complied with all\nthe recognition and measurement requirements without presenting consolidated financial statements, on the\nbasis that neither the parent nor the group was a reporting entity \u2013 to apply AASB 1, including the relief for\nthe first-time preparation of consolidated financial statements set out in Appendix C, to their transition to\nTier 2 GPFS.  \nBC21 The Board previously considered whether the transitional relief in paragraph 18A(b) should also be extended  \nto entities transitioning from unconsolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements GPFS to\nconsolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Simplified Disclosures GPFS. However, when finalising AASB 2020-2, the Board\ndecided that it would not be appropriate to extend the transition relief at that time as the extent to which\nentities would be affected was unknown, although it was expected to be limited. Furthermore:  \n(a) the Board expected that such entities should already have comprehensive IFRS-compliant\ninformation available to help produce consolidated financial statements, as the entity would be\nreporting that information to its parent; and  \n(b) entities that previously were preparing SPFS instead would be required to provide new additional\ndisclosures as well as potential changes to recognition and measurement requirements, and hence\nit could be argued that not having such other challenges would mean entities already preparing\nGPFS would have enough resources to consolidate retrospectively.[2]  \nBC22 Following the issue of AASB 2020-2, the Board received feedback from stakeholders expressing concern  \nthat it was unclear whether entities transitioning from unconsolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Reduced Disclosure\nRequirements GPFS to consolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Simplified Disclosures GPFS were able to apply AASB 1, as\nthere was no specific guidance in Australian Accounting Standards to explain the basis on which their first\nconsolidated financial statements should be prepared. Therefore, Australian Accounting Standards could be\nread to require such entities to apply the consolidation requirements fully retrospectively. Stakeholders were\nconcerned about this, based on their view that many of these entities do not have sufficient information to\nretrospectively consolidate as information might be prepared at a higher group level that is not relevant at\nthe level of the ultimate Australian parent entity. Further, stakeholders were also concerned about the ability\nfor comparative information to be audited retrospectively.  \nBC23 Although the Board previously considered this matter as noted in paragraph BC21, as the subsequent  \nfeedback was inconsistent with the Board\u2019s expectations, ED 315 proposed providing explicit relief to also\nallow entities transitioning from unconsolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements GPFS to\nconsolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Simplified Disclosures GPFS to apply AASB 1 when preparing consolidated financial\nstatements for the first time.  \nBC24 The Board acknowledged that proposing this transition relief would allow entities to potentially restate  \npreviously recognised amounts in accordance with AASB 1, even though the previous Tier 2 \u2013 Reduced\nDisclosure Requirements GPFS complied with all recognition and measurement requirements without\npresenting consolidated financial statements. However, the Board noted that this outcome is consistent with\nthe application of the relief available in AASB 1053 paragraph 18A(b) for entities that were preparing SPFS  \n2 AASB 2020-2 Basis for Conclusions, paragraph BC142.  \n-----  on the same basis (ie their SPFS complied with all the recognition and measurement requirements, without\npresenting consolidated financial statements, on the basis that neither the parent nor the group was a\nreporting entity).",

The Board acknowledged that compliance with IFRSs might not result in compliance with\nAustralian Accounting Standards as they apply to NFP entities, where NFP-specific recognition and\nmeasurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards are relevant to an entity. The Board noted\nthat a NFP entity would be unable to apply the optional exemption when transitioning to Australian\nAccounting Standards in relation to amounts included in a parent\u2019s IFRS-compliant consolidated financial\nstatements that do not comply with Australian Accounting Standards as they apply to NFP entities. NFP\nentities are required to comply with the applicable NFP requirements in Australian Accounting Standards\nwhen transitioning to those Standards, subject to any specific exceptions and exemptions in AASB 1.  \nBC31 The Board noted that this outcome is consistent with how the optional exemption is currently being applied  \nin some circumstances. For example, a NFP entity is unable to apply the optional exemption to assets and\nliabilities where the amounts included in the parent\u2019s consolidated financial statements do not comply with\nAustralian Accounting Standards as they apply to NFP entities. This could occur where a NFP entity has a\nfor-profit parent that prepares consolidated financial statements for the mixed group (ie a group that includes\nboth for-profit and NFP entities) using accounting policies appropriate to for-profit entities.",

The Board noted that referring only to IFRSs as\nproposed in ED 315 is consistent with the approach to first-time adoption in AASB 1. The Board was also\nconcerned about potential unintended consequences if the proposed amendment could be applied where a\nparent entity prepared financial statements that complied with IFRS-equivalent Standards, including possible\ndifficulties in determining which standards are considered IFRS-equivalent Standards.  \n-----  ",

However, two respondents suggested that the proposed amendment was unnecessary. In summary,\nthese respondents suggested that because the unconsolidated GPFS are separate financial statements, the\nentity would be applying Tier 2 requirements in the consolidated financial statements for the first time (if\nthey have not prepared consolidated financial statements in the past). Therefore, the entity could use AASB\n1 without the proposed amendment, as they would be a first-time adopter of Australian Accounting\nStandards in the consolidated financial statements. This is because an entity can be a first-time adopter in\nrelation to a set of financial statements \u2013 for example, its separate financial statements or consolidated\nfinancial statements \u2013 rather than in relation to the entity as such.  \nBC36 The Board noted that AASB 1 paragraph D17, although written in the context of a parent becoming a first\ntime adopter later than its subsidiary, appears to support the view that distinct \u2018first-time adoptions\u2019 are\npossible for an entity\u2019s separate financial statements and for its consolidated financial statements. Paragraph\nD17 states that \u201c\u2026 if a parent becomes a first-time adopter for its separate financial statements earlier or\nlater than for its consolidated financial statements, it shall measure its assets and liabilities at the same\namounts in both financial statements, except for consolidation adjustments.\u201d  \nBC37 The Board considered this feedback and decided to proceed with the proposed amendment to AASB 1053.  \nAlthough the Board acknowledged that the proposed amendment might not be strictly necessary due to the\nrequirements in AASB 1 paragraph D17, the Board considered that the amendment:  \n(a) is helpful to stakeholders because it clarifies that an entity can apply AASB 1 on transition from\nunconsolidated Tier 2 \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements GPFS to consolidated Tier 2 \u2013\nSimplified Disclosures GPFS;  \n(b) is consistent with the approach adopted by the Board in AASB 2020-2 for entities transitioning\nfrom SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS; and  \n(c) provides entities with an accounting policy choice that would otherwise be unavailable; that is,\nthey can choose whether to apply AASB 1 or AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in_\n_Accounting Estimates and Errors to their transition._  \nBC38 Two stakeholders also provided feedback suggesting that the proposed paragraph 20A of AASB 1053  \nshould also be available to NFP entities. The stakeholders suggested that broadening the scope of the\namendment would avoid any unforeseen effects on NFP entities that are currently preparing unconsolidated\nTier 2 \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements GPFS and that might decide to transition to consolidated Tier 2 \u2013\nSimplified Disclosures GPFS.  \nBC39 The Board acknowledged this feedback but reconfirmed its view that as NFP entities are not affected by the  \nremoval of SPFS and the \u2018reporting entity\u2019 definition in Australian Accounting Standards at this stage, they\ncan continue to consider themselves to be non-reporting entities and prepare single-entity Tier 2 \u2013\nSimplified Disclosures GPFS, applying the exemption in AASB 10, if appropriate. For this reason, the\nBoard decided no changes to the proposed AASB 1053 amendment were necessary.",
