        "page_content=": "## Classification of property as investment property or owner-occupied property  \n6 [Deleted]  \n7 Investment property is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. Therefore, an investment\nproperty generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by an entity. This distinguishes\ninvestment property from owner-occupied property. The production or supply of goods or services (or the\nuse of property for administrative purposes) generates cash flows that are attributable not only to property,\nbut also to other assets used in the production or supply process. AASB 116 applies to owned owneroccupied property and AASB 16 Leases applies to owner-occupied property held by a lessee as a right-ofuse asset.  \n8 The following are examples of investment property:  \n(a) land held for long-term capital appreciation rather than for short-term sale in the ordinary course\nof business.  \n(b) land held for a currently undetermined future use. (If an entity has not determined that it will use\nthe land as owner-occupied property or for short-term sale in the ordinary course of business, the\nland is regarded as held for capital appreciation.)  \n(c) a building owned by the entity (or a right-of-use asset relating to a building held by the entity)\nand leased out under one or more operating leases.  \n(d) a building that is vacant but is held to be leased out under one or more operating leases.  \n(e) property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property.  \n9 The following are examples of items that are not investment property and are therefore outside the scope of\nthis Standard:  \n(a) property intended for sale in the ordinary course of business or in the process of construction or\ndevelopment for such sale (see AASB 102 _Inventories), for example, property acquired_\nexclusively with a view to subsequent disposal in the near future or for development and resale.  \n(b) [deleted]  \n(c) owner-occupied property (see AASB 116 and AASB 16), including (among other things)\nproperty held for future use as owner-occupied property, property held for future development\nand subsequent use as owner-occupied property, property occupied by employees (whether or not\nthe employees pay rent at market rates) and owner-occupied property awaiting disposal.  \n(d) [deleted]  \n(e) property that is leased to another entity under a finance lease.  \nAus9.1 In respect of not-for-profit entities, property may be held to meet service delivery objectives\nrather than to earn rental or for capital appreciation. In such situations the property will not meet\nthe definition of investment property and will be accounted for under AASB 116, for example:  \n(a) property held for strategic purposes; and  \n(b) property held to provide a social service, including those which generate cash inflows\nwhere the rental revenue is incidental to the purpose for holding the property.  \n10 Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and another\nportion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. If\nthese portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease), an entity accounts\nfor the portions separately. If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is investment property\nonly if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for\nadministrative purposes.  \n11 In some cases, an entity provides ancillary services to the occupants of a property it holds. An entity treats\nsuch a property as investment property if the services are insignificant to the arrangement as a whole. An\nexample is when the owner of an office building provides security and maintenance services to the lessees\nwho occupy the building.  \n-----  12 In other cases, the services provided are significant. For example, if an entity owns and manages a hotel,\nservices provided to guests are significant to the arrangement as a whole. Therefore, an owner-managed\nhotel is owner-occupied property, rather than investment property.  \n13 It may be difficult to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that a property does not qualify\nas investment property. For example, the owner of a hotel sometimes transfers some responsibilities to third\nparties under a management contract. The terms of such contracts vary widely. At one end of the spectrum,\nthe owner\u2019s position may, in substance, be that of a passive investor. At the other end of the spectrum, the\nowner may simply have outsourced day-to-day functions while retaining significant exposure to variation in\nthe cash flows generated by the operations of the hotel.  \n14 Judgement is needed to determine whether a property qualifies as investment property. An entity develops\ncriteria so that it can exercise that judgement consistently in accordance with the definition of investment\nproperty and with the related guidance in paragraphs 7\u201313. Paragraph 75(c) requires an entity to disclose\nthese criteria when classification is difficult.  \n14A Judgement is also needed to determine whether the acquisition of investment property is the acquisition of\nan asset or a group of assets or a business combination within the scope of AASB 3 Business Combinations.\nReference should be made to AASB 3 to determine whether it is a business combination. The discussion in\nparagraphs 7\u201314 of this Standard relates to whether or not property is owner-occupied property or\ninvestment property and not to determining whether or not the acquisition of property is a business\ncombination as defined in AASB 3. Determining whether a specific transaction meets the definition of a\nbusiness combination as defined in AASB 3 and includes an investment property as defined in this Standard\nrequires the separate application of both Standards.  \n15 In some cases, an entity owns property that is leased to, and occupied by, its parent or another subsidiary.\nThe property does not qualify as investment property in the consolidated financial statements, because the\nproperty is owner-occupied from the perspective of the group. However, from the perspective of the entity\nthat owns it, the property is investment property if it meets the definition in paragraph 5. Therefore, the\nlessor treats the property as investment property in its individual financial statements.",

These costs include costs incurred initially to acquire an investment property and costs incurred\nsubsequently to add to, replace part of, or service a property.  \n18 Under the recognition principle in paragraph 16, an entity does not recognise in the carrying amount of an\ninvestment property the costs of the day-to-day servicing of such a property. Rather, these costs are\nrecognised in profit or loss as incurred. Costs of day-to-day servicing are primarily the cost of labour and\nconsumables, and may include the cost of minor parts. The purpose of these expenditures is often described\nas for the \u2018repairs and maintenance\u2019 of the property.  \n19 Parts of investment properties may have been acquired through replacement. For example, the interior walls\nmay be replacements of original walls. Under the recognition principle, an entity recognises in the carrying\namount of an investment property the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time\nthat cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced\nis derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard.  \n19A An investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset shall be recognised in accordance with\nAASB 16.",

AASB 1058** **_Income of Not-for-Profit Entities addresses the_**\n**recognition of related amounts.**  \n21 The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable\nexpenditure. Directly attributable expenditure includes, for example, professional fees for legal services,\nproperty transfer taxes and other transaction costs.  \n22 [Deleted]  \n23 The cost of an investment property is not increased by:  \n(a) start-up costs (unless they are necessary to bring the property to the condition necessary for it to\nbe capable of operating in the manner intended by management),  \n(b) operating losses incurred before the investment property achieves the planned level of occupancy,\nor  \n(c) abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour or other resources incurred in constructing or\ndeveloping the property.  \n24 If payment for an investment property is deferred, its cost is the cash price equivalent. The difference\nbetween this amount and the total payments is recognised as interest expense over the period of credit.  \n25 [Deleted]  \n26 [Deleted]  \n27 One or more investment properties may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a\ncombination of monetary and non-monetary assets. The following discussion refers to an exchange of one\nnon-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence. The\ncost of such an investment property is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks\ncommercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably\nmeasurable. The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise\nthe asset given up. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying\namount of the asset given up.  \n28 An entity determines whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance by considering the extent\nto which its future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An exchange transaction\nhas commercial substance if:  \n(a) the configuration (risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from\nthe configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred, or  \n(b) the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity\u2019s operations affected by the transaction\nchanges as a result of the exchange, and  \n(c) the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged.  \nFor the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entityspecific value of the portion of the entity\u2019s operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash\nflows. The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations.  \n29 The fair value of an asset is reliably measurable if (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value\nmeasurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the\nrange can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring fair value. If the entity is able to measure\nreliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given\nup is used to measure cost unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.  \n29A An investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset shall be measured initially at its cost in\naccordance with AASB 16.",

It is highly unlikely that a change from the\nfair value model to the cost model will result in a more relevant presentation.  \n32 This Standard requires all entities to measure the fair value of investment property, for the purpose of either\nmeasurement (if the entity uses the fair value model) or disclosure (if it uses the cost model). An entity is\nencouraged, but not required, to measure the fair value of investment property on the basis of a valuation by\nan independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent\nexperience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.  \n**32A** **An entity may:**  \n**(a)** **choose either the fair value model or the cost model for all investment property backing**\n**liabilities that pay a return linked directly to the fair value of, or returns from, specified**\n**assets including that investment property; and**  \n**(b)** **choose either the fair value model or the cost model for all other investment property,**\n**regardless of the choice made in (a).**  \n32B Some entities operate, either internally or externally, an investment fund that provides investors with\nbenefits determined by units in the fund. Similarly, some entities issue insurance contracts with direct\nparticipation features, for which the underlying items include investment property. For the purposes of\nparagraphs 32A\u201332B only, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation\nfeatures. Paragraph 32A does not permit an entity to measure property held by the fund (or property that is\nan underlying item) partly at cost and partly at fair value. (See AASB 17 _Insurance Contracts for terms_\nused in this paragraph that are defined in that Standard.)  \n32C If an entity chooses different models for the two categories described in paragraph 32A, sales of investment\nproperty between pools of assets measured using different models shall be recognised at fair value and the\ncumulative change in fair value shall be recognised in profit or loss. Accordingly, if an investment property\nis sold from a pool in which the fair value model is used into a pool in which the cost model is used, the\nproperty\u2019s fair value at the date of the sale becomes its deemed cost.",

When lease payments\nare at market rates, the fair value of an investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset at\nacquisition, net of all expected lease payments (including those relating to recognised lease liabilities),\nshould be zero. Thus, remeasuring a right-of-use asset from cost in accordance with AASB 16 to fair value\nin accordance with paragraph 33 (taking into account the requirements in paragraph 50) should not give rise\nto any initial gain or loss, unless fair value is measured at different times. This could occur when an election\nto apply the fair value model is made after initial recognition.  \n42\u2013\n47 [Deleted]  \n48 In exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when an entity first acquires an investment property (or when\nan existing property first becomes investment property after a change in use) that the variability in the range\nof reasonable fair value measurements will be so great, and the probabilities of the various outcomes so\ndifficult to assess, that the usefulness of a single measure of fair value is negated. This may indicate that the\nfair value of the property will not be reliably measurable on a continuing basis (see paragraph 53).  \n-----  49 [Deleted]  \n50 In determining the carrying amount of investment property under the fair value model, an entity does not\ndouble-count assets or liabilities that are recognised as separate assets or liabilities. For example:  \n(a) equipment such as lifts or air-conditioning is often an integral part of a building and is generally\nincluded in the fair value of the investment property, rather than recognised separately as\nproperty, plant and equipment.  \n(b) if an office is leased on a furnished basis, the fair value of the office generally includes the fair\nvalue of the furniture, because the rental income relates to the furnished office. When furniture is\nincluded in the fair value of investment property, an entity does not recognise that furniture as a\nseparate asset.  \n(c) the fair value of investment property excludes prepaid or accrued operating lease income, because\nthe entity recognises it as a separate liability or asset.  \n(d) the fair value of investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset reflects expected cash\nflows (including variable lease payments that are expected to become payable). Accordingly, if a\nvaluation obtained for a property is net of all payments expected to be made, it will be necessary\nto add back any recognised lease liability, to arrive at the carrying amount of the investment\nproperty using the fair value model.  \n51 [Deleted]  \n52 In some cases, an entity expects that the present value of its payments relating to an investment property\n(other than payments relating to recognised liabilities) will exceed the present value of the related cash\nreceipts. An entity applies AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to determine\nwhether to recognise a liability and, if so, how to measure it.",

However, in exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when an entity**\n**first acquires an investment property (or when an existing property first becomes investment**\n**property after a change in use) that the fair value of the investment property is not reliably**\n**measurable on a continuing basis. This arises when, and only when, the market for comparable**\n**properties is inactive (eg there are few recent transactions, price quotations are not current or**\n**observed transaction prices indicate that the seller was forced to sell) and alternative reliable**\n**measurements of fair value (for example, based on discounted cash flow projections) are not**\n**available. If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is**\n**not reliably measurable but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably measurable when**\n**construction is complete, it shall measure that investment property under construction at cost until**\n**either its fair value becomes reliably measurable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier).**\n**If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property (other than an investment**\n**property under construction) is not reliably measurable on a continuing basis, the entity shall**\n**measure that investment property using the cost model in AASB 116 for owned investment property**\n**or in accordance with AASB 16 for investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset. The**\n**residual value of the investment property shall be assumed to be zero. The entity shall continue to**\n**apply AASB 116 or AASB 16 until disposal of the investment property.**  \n53A Once an entity becomes able to measure reliably the fair value of an investment property under construction\nthat has previously been measured at cost, it shall measure that property at its fair value. Once construction\nof that property is complete, it is presumed that fair value can be measured reliably. If this is not the case, in\naccordance with paragraph 53, the property shall be accounted for using the cost model in accordance with\nAASB 116 for owned assets or AASB 16 for investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset.  \n53B The presumption that the fair value of investment property under construction can be measured reliably can\nbe rebutted only on initial recognition. An entity that has measured an item of investment property under\nconstruction at fair value may not conclude that the fair value of the completed investment property cannot\nbe measured reliably.  \n54 In the exceptional cases when an entity is compelled, for the reason given in paragraph 53, to measure an\ninvestment property using the cost model in accordance with AASB 116 or AASB 16, it measures at fair\nvalue all its other investment property, including investment property under construction. In these cases,\nalthough an entity may use the cost model for one investment property, the entity shall continue to account\nfor each of the remaining properties using the fair value model.  \n-----  **55** **If an entity has previously measured an investment property at fair value, it shall continue to**\n**measure the property at fair value until disposal (or until the property becomes owner-occupied**\n**property or the entity begins to develop the property for subsequent sale in the ordinary course of**\n**business) even if comparable market transactions become less frequent or market prices become less**\n**readily available.**",

The\ndate of disposal for investment property that is sold is the date the recipient obtains control of the\ninvestment property in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is\nsatisfied in AASB 15. AASB 16 applies to a disposal effected by entering into a finance lease and to a sale\nand leaseback.  \n68 If, in accordance with the recognition principle in paragraph 16, an entity recognises in the carrying amount\nof an asset the cost of a replacement for part of an investment property, it derecognises the carrying amount\nof the replaced part. For investment property accounted for using the cost model, a replaced part may not be\na part that was depreciated separately. If it is not practicable for an entity to determine the carrying amount\nof the replaced part, it may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced\npart was at the time it was acquired or constructed.

In other cases it may\nbe difficult to discern how much fair value should be reduced for the part being replaced.
