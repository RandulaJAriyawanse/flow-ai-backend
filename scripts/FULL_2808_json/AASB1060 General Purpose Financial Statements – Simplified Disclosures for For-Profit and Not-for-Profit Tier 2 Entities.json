This information may be based on acquittal processes applied by an\nentity. When spending limits imposed by parliamentary appropriation or other authorisation have not been\ncomplied with, information regarding the amount of, and reasons for, the non-compliance is relevant for\nassessing the performance of management, the likely consequences of non-compliance, and the ability of the\nentity to continue to provide services at a similar or different level in the future.  \n241 Broad summaries of the major categories of appropriations and associated expenditures, rather than detailed\nreporting of appropriations for each activity or output, is sufficient for most users of such an entity\u2019s financial\nstatements.

Service concession\nassets of a similar nature may form a subset of a class of assets disclosed in accordance with these sections or\nmay be included in more than one class of assets disclosed in accordance with these sections. For example,\nfor the purposes of the section covering Property, Plant and Equipment and Investment Property at Cost, a\ntoll bridge may be included in the same class as other bridges, and for the purposes of paragraph 242 may be\nincluded with service concession assets reported in aggregate as toll roads.",

An entity assesses whether\ninformation, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its\nfinancial statements taken as a whole.  \nInformation is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users of\nfinancial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The following are examples of circumstances\nthat may result in material information being obscured:  \n(a) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the financial\nstatements but the language used is vague or unclear;  \n(b) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is scattered throughout the\nfinancial statements;  \n(c) dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated;  \n(d) similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and  \n(e) the understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a result of material information being\nhidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what\ninformation is material.  \nAssessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary\nusers of a specific reporting entity\u2019s general purpose financial statements requires an entity to consider the\ncharacteristics of those users while also considering the entity\u2019s own circumstances.  \nMany existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to provide\ninformation directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial\ninformation they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose financial\nstatements are directed. Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of\nbusiness and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At times, even wellinformed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex\neconomic phenomena.  \n45 Definition of IFRSs amended after the name changes introduced by the revised Constitution of the IFRS Foundation in 2010.  \n-----  **_Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the statement of financial position,_**\n**statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, separate income statement (if**\n**presented), statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows.

However, in March 2020 the Board decided to remove this ability based on the\nfeedback received on the March 2018 Consultation Paper ITC 39 Applying the IASB\u2019s Revised Conceptual\n_Framework and Solving the Reporting Entity and Special Purpose Financial Statement Problems and the_\nsubsequent ED 297 Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for Certain For-Profit Private Sector\n_Entities._  \nBC5 AASB 2020-2 removes the ability to prepare SPFS for the following for-profit entities:  \n(a) for-profit private sector entities that are required by legislation to comply with either Australian\nAccounting Standards or accounting standards;  \n(b) other for-profit private sector entities that are required only by their constituting document or\nanother document to comply with Australian Accounting Standards, provided that the relevant\ndocument was created or amended on or after 1 July 2021; and  \n1 In January 2020, the IASB moved its Disclosure Initiative \u2013 Subsidiaries that are SMEs project to the standard-setting programme. The\nobjective of the project is to develop a reduced disclosure IFRS Standard that would apply on a voluntary basis to subsidiaries that do not\nhave public accountability.  \n2 AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards, paragraphs 11-13  \n-----  (c) other for-profit entities that elect to prepare GPFS and apply the revised Conceptual Framework\n_for Financial Reporting_ (Conceptual Framework) and the consequential amendments to other\npronouncements set out in Accounting Standards AASB 2019-1 _Amendments to Australian_\n_Accounting Standards \u2013 References to the Conceptual Framework and AASB 2020-2 Amendments_\nto Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 _Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for_\n_Certain For-Profit Sector Entities._  \nBC6 To help reduce the cost burden for for-profit entities that will be affected by the removal of SPFS, and noting\nthe comments received on ITC 39, the Board agreed to make further reductions to the disclosures that apply\nto Tier 2 entities compared to the GPFS Tier 2 RDR framework.  \nBC7 The Board also noted the strong preference expressed by respondents to ITC 39 for a framework that includes\nfull R&M requirements in AAS on the grounds that it would enhance the comparability, consistency and\ntransparency of the financial statements. Feedback from targeted outreach emphasised that users agreed the\nusefulness of information within financial statements for decision making is adversely affected where entities\nhave not consistently applied R&M requirements. Further discussion of the Board\u2019s consideration on this\nmatter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC108\u2212BC114.  \nBC8 While some respondents had called for more than one Tier 2 GPFS framework for for-profit entities, the\nBoard noted that given the small number of for-profit entities required to publicly lodge financial statements\nwith ASIC, which will be even less following the increase of the reporting thresholds for large proprietary\ncompanies (April 2019), the development and maintenance of more than two GPFS disclosure frameworks\nwas not warranted. The Board further emphasised that entities without a statutory requirement to comply with\nAAS, such as those below the now doubled large proprietary thresholds, would be able to continue to tailor\ntheir financial statements to the needs of their specific users and therefore additional Tiers were not required.\nFurther discussion of the Board\u2019s consideration on this matter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs\nBC99\u2212BC107.  \nBC9 However, separate targeted consultations will be undertaken in relation to the implementation of the IASB\u2019s\nrevised Conceptual Framework by not-for-profit (NFP) private and public sector entities which may result in\nmore than two tiers for those sectors, as the characteristics of those sectors are quite different. For these\nentities, this Standard is therefore an interim measure until more progress is made through further consultation\nand outreach.  \nBC10 After having considered the various options outlined below and the feedback received on ED 295 General\n_Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities, the_\nBoard is of the view that this Standard addresses stakeholders\u2019 concerns and provides an appropriate balance\nbetween user needs and preparer costs.",

Alternative 1 was\nthe existing Tier 2 RDR under AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards which\nrequires compliance with the full R&M requirements of AAS (as amended for NFP specific issues) and with\nminimum disclosures specified in each Standard.  \nBC13 The second proposed alternative, the Specified Disclosure Requirement (SDR), was a revised disclosure\nframework. It required full R&M requirements of AAS (as amended for NFP specific issues) and included\nthe disclosure of those Standards that are currently mandatory for entities required to prepare financial\nstatements in accordance with Chapter 2M of the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cwth), being AASB 101\n_Presentation of Financial Statements, AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows, AASB 108 Accounting Policies,_\n_Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, AASB 1048_ _Interpretation of Standards and AASB 1054_\n_Australian Additional Disclosures, and disclosures required by AASB 15_ _Revenue from Contracts with_  \n-----  _Customers, AASB 112 Income Taxes, AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures and AASB 136 Impairment of_\n_Assets._  \nBC14 After issuing ITC 39, the Board held targeted outreach with key stakeholders, including State, Territory and\nNational regulators, audit offices, accounting firms, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), the Australian\nTaxation Office (ATO), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), credit rating agencies\nand professional bodies. The ITC 39 proposals were also presented at various forums, workshops, roundtables\nand discussion groups.  \nBC15 The Board received feedback on its proposals in ITC 39 through 33 formal comment letters from professional\nservice firms, regulators, professional bodies, academics, preparers, users of financial statements and other\nrespondents. Furthermore, feedback was sought via targeted user and preparer surveys in quarter 3 of 2018,\nwhich received a total of 37 user and 49 preparer responses[3]. The surveys were focussed on the specific\nmatters for comment in ITC 39, and were used to get a better understanding of which of the Tier 2 GPFS\nframeworks proposed in ITC 39 users preferred (and why), as well as what transitional relief would be helpful\nto preparers.  \nBC16 The feedback on the proposed SDR framework was that the SDR had too many disclosures in some ways but\nfell short in many other ways. For example, the feedback received from roundtables, surveys and submissions\non ITC 39 was that whilst the disclosures in SDR are important, requiring full disclosure of those nine\nStandards (as explained in paragraph BC13) was too much. Most participants further suggested that SDR\nmight not be appropriate for all industry sectors and is missing some critical disclosures to help predict the\nviability of an entity such as liquidity, contingent liabilities, subsequent events and commitment disclosures.  \nBC17 At the same time, respondents noted that refining the principles used in determining the level of disclosures\nrequired for Tier 2 entities to achieve an appropriate balance between the benefits of financial information to\nusers and the costs to preparers of providing that information is crucial. The feedback from the roundtables,\nsurveys and submissions on ITC 39 indicated that RDR has too many disclosure requirements.",

        "page_content=": "## Revisiting the proposals in ED 277  \nBC18 The RDR disclosure requirements in Australia and New Zealand are essentially the same and are based on an\napproach developed by the Board in 2010. That approach draws on the disclosure requirements in the IFRS\n_for SMEs Standard when Tier 2 R&M requirements are the same as those under the IFRS for SMEs Standard;_\nand applies the \u2018user needs\u2019 and \u2018cost-benefit\u2019 principles applied by the IASB in developing its _IFRS for_\n_SMEs Standard when full R&M requirements are not the same as those available under the IFRS for SMEs_\nStandard. A top-down approach is used which starts with the full IFRS disclosures and then identifies those\nthat can be removed. The Board noted that there could be a tendency to retain disclosures in circumstances\nwhere a direct comparison is not possible.  \nBC19 A post implementation review of the RDR framework was carried out by the Board which identified that the\nRDR disclosure requirements had not delivered the expected outcome and that take up of the RDR framework\nby entities was consequently low[4]. In response to the findings of the post implementation review, the Board\nissued ED 277 in January 2017 as a joint project with the New Zealand Accounting Standards Board\n(NZASB).  \nBC20 ED 277 proposed adopting an RDR decision-making framework, together with accompanying operational\nguidance. The framework was based on Key Disclosure Areas (KDAs) which were meant to result in\ninformation that meets user needs. Judgement was required when applying this framework, and the\noverarching principles of user needs and cost-benefit were considered when determining the disclosures that\nTier 2 entities should make.  \nBC21 The approach taken in the proposed Tier 2 framework in ED 277 was to include an Australian Appendix in\neach AAS that identifies the disclosures that Tier 2 entities are required to provide, thereby addressing\nconcerns by those that find the shading used to identify disclosures that can be omitted confusing. However,\nwhile ED 277 was based on clear disclosure principles, the cost-benefit analysis was difficult to apply in the  \n3 See AASB Staff Paper Enhancing the revised Conceptual Framework and replacing Special Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 For-profit\n_User and Preparer Survey Results._  \n4 As per paragraph BC14 of ED 277, the level of adoption among other types of companies, including large proprietary companies was\nvery low \u2013 with the likely reason being that the general level of disclosure under Tier 2 was still viewed as burdensome. A research paper\n(Potter, B., Tanewski, G., and Wright, S., 2016, Financial Reporting by Private Companies in Australia: Current Practice and\nOpportunities for Research, paper presented at the AASB Research Forum, November 24 2016, Sydney) on the financial reporting\npractices by a sample of large proprietary companies in Australia lodging annual financial statements with ASIC identified that:\n(i) less than 10 percent of the total sample use Tier 2 disclosures; and  \n(ii) of those large proprietary companies sampled that prepare GPFS, around 20 percent use Tier 2 disclosures.  \nA subsequent analysis of financial reports of for-profit non-disclosing entities lodging financial statements with ASIC in 2018 confirmed\nthat 71 percent of these entities were still lodging SPFS with ASIC, 13 percent lodged Tier 2 GPFS and 16 percent Tier 1.  \n-----  context of disclosures and the top-down approach resulted in too many disclosures being retained, as removal\nwas difficult to justify with the KDAs.  \nBC22 Feedback from Australian stakeholders confirmed that ED 277 still resulted in too many disclosures. While\nthe Board had intended to conduct further outreach and consultation on the proposals in ED 277, any further\nwork was put on hold following the issue of the revised Conceptual Framework by the IASB in March 2018\nand the decision by the Board to reform the Australian Financial Reporting Framework and propose removing\nthe ability for entities to prepare SPFS when required to comply with AAS by legislation or otherwise.",

The Board\nfurther noted that the IASB had added a research project on Subsidiaries that are SMEs to their agenda in\nMarch 2019, which was moved to the standard-setting programme in January 2020. Consistent with the policy\nof adopting Standards issued by the IASB for application by Australian entities, AASB 1060 may ultimately\nbe replaced with the Standard developed by the IASB. This would not only remove the need for the Board to\nmaintain a separate Tier 2 Standard, but also provide comparability and consistency for subsidiary reporting\nglobally. However, this is a longer-term project and the Board needs to have a revised disclosure framework\nin place in time for the removal of SPFS from 1 July 2021. While the Board could therefore not wait for the\nIASB to complete their project, the Board will monitor the progress of the IASB\u2019s project closely.  \nBC25 The disclosures that are relevant to Tier 2 entities are set out in a separate Standard, being AASB 1060, which\nwas exposed for public comment in August 2019 as ED 295, together with ED 297. The comment period for\nboth EDs ended on 30 November 2019.  \nBC26 Extensive outreach was conducted on the proposals, including roundtables in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane,\nPerth and Adelaide, attended by 127 stakeholders, a webinar with 162 participants, as well as separate\nconsultations with the AASB\u2019s User Advisory Committee, credit analysts and private equity investors.  \nBC27 The Board received 25 formal submissions on ED 295 from stakeholders representing professional services\nfirms, regulators, professional bodies, academics, preparers, public sector audit offices, software providers\nand others.  \nBC28 The following section details the matter considered by the Board in developing the proposals and this\nStandard, including the Board\u2019s decisions on how to address stakeholders\u2019 feedback as part of the exposure\nprocess.",

        "page_content=": "## Costs vs benefits  \nBC29 The Board identified the following benefits arising from the adoption of the new Tier 2 Standard over the\nother options considered:  \n(a) The IASB has developed the disclosures in the _IFRS for SMEs Standard with for-profit private_\nsector entities that are not publicly accountable entities in mind and considers that they are adequate\nto meet the needs of the relevant users[5].  \n(b) A comparison of the new disclosures to the disclosures that would be required under the SDR and\nRDR has confirmed that adoption of the new Tier 2 Standard addresses stakeholders concerns by\nresulting in a level of disclosures that lies in between the current RDR and the proposed SDR\nrequirements.  \n(c) This option is based on a bottom-up approach in developing disclosures and avoids needing to\nidentify specific full IFRS disclosures that need to be retained and those that can be excluded. It is\na more rigorous and targeted way of reducing disclosures to an appropriate level (based on previous  \n5 The IASB was guided by the broad principles set out in paragraph BC41, but also relied on the recommendations of a working group\nwhich undertook a comprehensive review of the disclosure proposals in the exposure draft, and the comments on those proposals in\nresponse to the exposure draft. In addition, the IASB received feedback from representatives of a number of German banks that lend\nextensively to small private entities and provided the IASB with a comprehensive report on disclosure needs from a bank lender\u2019s\nperspective. See paragraphs BC44-BC47 and BC156-158 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard \u2013 Part B.  \n-----  experiences with the RDR approach, as it involves needing to justify additional disclosures rather\nthan the removal of disclosures from full IFRS).  \n(d) This option introduces more flexibility as it allows drafting disclosures to suit the circumstances\nand not be restricted by existing full IFRS disclosures.  \n(e) Setting out the disclosures in a separate Standard will make it easier for stakeholders, as it avoids\nhaving to identify applicable disclosures via shading in between the full disclosures. The Board\nnoted that this will also improve readability where parts of sentences were shaded in the RDR (ie\nexcluded).  \nBC30 However, the Board noted that adopting this Standard will result in a divergence from the New Zealand RDR\nFramework. The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework sets out that differences between\naccounting Standards issued in Australia and New Zealand for for-profit entities should be minimised\nwherever possible to reduce the costs for entities operating trans-Tasman. This divergence could cause\ninconvenience for entities operating trans-Tasman. Notwithstanding this, the Board noted that the R&M\nrequirements for entities applying the Tier 2 reporting frameworks in Australia and New Zealand would\nremain consistent and given the current situation of many Australian entities not complying with full R&M\nrequirements, the overall outcome is likely to be more consistency with NZ requirements than currently. The\nBoard further noted that the NZ XRB has asked its stakeholders about the importance of harmonisation with\nAustralia in their Targeted Review of the Accounting Standards Framework in July 2019 and that the NZASB\nwill consider the feedback in future discussions on whether and how to respond to the developments in\nAustralia and internationally.  \nBC31 The Board also noted that the simplified Tier 2 disclosures are contained in a separate Standard which might\nnot be welcomed by preparers who prefer seeing the disclosure requirements together with the R&M\nrequirements in each Standard. However, only four respondents to ED 295 did not like having a separate\ndisclosure standard. Feedback at the roundtables and webinars was overwhelmingly positive.  \nBC32 Finally, for entities that were previously preparing SPFS, the adoption of AASB 2020-2 means a step-up in\ntheir disclosures. The disclosures will also likely exceed what would have been required under the SDR\nproposals outlined in paragraph BC13. However, there will be some disclosure relief, as SPFS currently are\nrequired to comply with all the disclosures in the mandatory standards (AASB 101, AASB 107, AASB 108,\nAASB 1048 and AASB 1054) which go beyond what is required under AASB 1060. Furthermore, the\ndoubling of the reporting thresholds for large proprietary companies in April 2019 has already reduced the\nnumber of entities that are required to prepare and lodge financial statements with ASIC by approximately\n2,300 companies, and the Board has further reduced the burden for affected entities by providing transitional\nrelief for entities that are adopting AASB 2020-2 and AASB 1060 early, ie for financial years beginning\nbefore 1 July 2021. Further discussion of the Board\u2019s consideration on this matter is available in\nAASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC122\u2212BC153.  \nBC33 After considering both the advantages and disadvantages noted above, the Board was of the view that the\nsimplified disclosures strike the right balance between user needs and cost to preparers and appropriately\naddress the concerns raised by respondents to ITC 39. In particular, the Board noted the strong support for a\nconsistent reporting framework which requires compliance with full R&M requirements in AAS but revisits\nthe current disclosures that are required for Tier 2 entities under the RDR framework. The disclosures in\nAASB 1060 will not only be beneficial for entities that are already reporting under Tier 2 but also those\nentities that will have to step up from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS when the removal of SPFS for certain for-profit\nprivate sector entities that are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS or accounting\nstandards through AASB 2020-2 becomes applicable.",

        "page_content=": "## Methodology and principles applied  \nBC34 In accordance with AASB 1053, Tier 2 requirements comprise the R&M requirements of Tier 1 but\nsubstantially reduced disclosure requirements. AASB 1053 sets out the eligibility criteria that entities must\nmeet to report in accordance with the Tier 2 framework. This framework does not change those criteria.  \nBC35 The Board agreed to develop the new disclosures via a bottom-up approach, starting with the existing\ndisclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. This avoids having to identify specific full AAS disclosures that\nneed to be retained and those that can be excluded. This approach also avoids the tendency to retain\ndisclosures in circumstances where a direct comparison is not possible. To distinguish the new disclosure\nframework from the previous RDR framework, it will be referred to as the \u2018Simplified Disclosures\u2019\nframework.  \n-----  BC36 While the Board has decided not to adopt the IFRS for SMEs Standard as an alternative for Tier 2 reporting[6],\nthe IASB\u2019s assessment of user needs and cost-benefit considerations in relation to the disclosures for this\ngroup of entities will be similarly relevant to Australian for-profit private sector entities without public\naccountability. The Board therefore considers the IFRS for SMEs based disclosures an appropriate starting\npoint for developing a disclosure Standard for this group of entities.  \nBC37 The Simplified Disclosures framework is based on the premise that the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard should be retained where the R&M requirements and options are the same or similar in the IFRS for\n_SMEs Standard and full IFRS. Disclosures relating to R&M options or treatments in the_ _IFRS for SMEs_\n_Standard that are not available in full IFRS will be removed. Disclosures have only been added in comparison_\nwith the IFRS for SMEs Standard base where the R&M principles were significantly different or certain topics\nare not addressed under the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  \nBC38 In considering the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board noted that the nature and degree of the differences\nbetween the disclosures in full IFRS Standards and the disclosures in the _IFRS for SMEs Standard is_\ndetermined on the basis of users\u2019 needs and cost-benefit analyses[7]. The Board noted that the overall increase\nin disclosures for entities transitioning from SPFS (eg related party and financial instrument disclosures)\noffsets the loss of some disclosures as a result of not having to fully comply with AASB 101, AASB 107,\nAASB 108, AASB 1048 and AASB 1054. In some instances, based on user feedback, public policy interest\n(eg audit fees and tax reconciliation \u2013 see paragraphs BC75 and BC79\u201380) or to reflect Australian specific\nissues (eg imputation credits \u2013 see paragraphs BC83-BC84), the Board has retained additional disclosures\nabove IFRS for SMEs.  \nBC39 The disclosure requirements in the _IFRS for SMEs Standard are therefore substantially reduced when_\ncompared with the disclosure requirements in full IFRS Standards. The IASB identified the following four\nprinciples as being used for the reductions:  \n(a) some disclosures are not included because they relate to topics covered in IFRS Standards that are\nomitted from the IFRS for SMEs Standard (as per paragraph BC88 of IFRS for SMEs Standard 2015\n\u2013 Part B);  \n(b) some disclosures are not included because they relate to R&M principles in full IFRSs that have\nbeen replaced by simplifications in the IFRS for SMEs Standard (as per paragraphs BC98\u2013BC136\nof the IFRS for SMEs Standard 2015 \u2013 Part B);  \n(c) some disclosures are not included because they relate to options in full IFRS Standards that are not\nincluded in the IFRS for SMEs Standard (as per paragraphs BC84\u2013BC86 of the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard 2015 \u2013 Part B); and  \n(d) some disclosures are not included on the basis of users\u2019 needs or cost-benefit considerations (as per\nparagraphs BC44\u2013BC47, BC157 and BC158 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard 2015 \u2013 Part B).  \nBC40 In addition to these principles, the Board further decided that disclosures should be reduced from the IFRS\n_for SMEs Standard where the disclosure requirements_ have been removed from full IFRS after the IFRS for\n_SMEs Standard was finalised and as a result exceed what is currently required under the full IFRS (as per_\nparagraphs BC43, BC66\u2013BC67 and BC71 of this Standard).  \nBC41 In determining what disclosures to add, the following broad principles have been applied by the Board, which\nare consistent with those applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard[8]:  \n(a) users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not publicly accountable entities are\nparticularly interested in information about short-term cash flows and about obligations,\ncommitments or contingencies, whether or not recognised as liabilities. Thus disclosures in full\nIFRS Standards that provide this sort of information are necessary;  \n(b) users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not publicly accountable entities are\nparticularly interested in information about liquidity and solvency. Thus disclosures in full IFRS\nStandards that provide this sort of information are necessary;  \n(c) information on measurement uncertainties is important;  \n(d) information about an entity\u2019s accounting policy choices is important;  \n6 In considering the feedback received on ITC 39, the AASB noted in February 2019 that while a minority of respondents had asked the\nBoard to consider the IFRS for SMEs Standard as an option or alternative for Tier 2 GPFS, these respondents did not provide any new\narguments as to whether the IFRS for SMEs Standard would be preferable to full R&M. The AASB further noted that the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard includes requirements for consolidated financial statements, deferred tax accounting, financial instruments accounting and\nrelated party disclosures that are not substantively different to full IFRS R&M requirements. For these reasons, the AASB decided not to\npropose a Tier 2 GPFS framework with differential R&M requirements as an option or alternative for Tier 2 GPFS for the for-profit\nsector. Further discussion of the Board\u2019s consideration on this matter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC99\u2212BC107.  \n7 As per paragraph BC46 of IFRS for SMEs Standard \u2013 Part B.  \n8 See paragraph BC157 of IFRS for SMEs Standard \u2013 Part B.  \n-----  (e) disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not\npublicly accountable entities are important for an understanding of those statements; and  \n(f) some disclosures in full IFRS Standards are more relevant to investment decisions in public capital\nmarkets than to the transactions and other events and conditions encountered by typical for-profit\nentities that are not publicly accountable entities.  \nBC42 In addition, to these principles the Board agreed to add disclosures where they address matters of public policy\n(eg audit fees and tax reconciliation \u2013 see paragraphs BC75 and BC79\u2013BC80) or reflect Australian specific\nissues (eg imputation credits \u2013 see paragraphs BC83-BC84).  \nBC43 Consistent with the IASB\u2019s intentions in relation to the Subsidiaries that are SMEs project, tailoring of the\nIFRS for SMEs disclosure requirements has further been restricted to the absolute minimum. As identified in\nparagraph BC70, this resulted in the retention of termination benefit disclosures which are not required under\nfull AAS. However, consistent with the principle in paragraph BC40, where the IASB has removed\ndisclosures from full IFRS after the IFRS for SMEs Standard was finalised, these reductions were carried over\nto AASB 1060. This has affected in particular the leasing disclosures, see paragraphs BC66\u2013BC67 and\nresulted in the removal of a number of employee benefits disclosures.  \nBC44 To identify R&M differences, the Board has referred to:  \n(a) the AASB staff paper _Comparison of Standards for Smaller Entities prepared and published in_\nApril 2018;  \n(b) full IFRS vs _IFRS for SMEs Standard comparisons included in the_ _IFRS for SMEs Standard_\nmodules published by the IASB; and  \n(c) individual analyses of Standards, where a topic is covered by neither of these two sources.  \nBC45 Judgement was exercised when applying the framework and the overarching principles of user needs and\ncost-benefit were considered when determining the disclosures that are relevant for Tier 2 entities. Significant\njudgements made in this process are explained in paragraphs BC54\u2212BC93.  \nBC46 The disclosures that are relevant to Tier 2 entities are set out in this Standard (ie are not shaded in the body\nor the appendix of each AAS). They are considered by the Board to be appropriate for GPFSs that are publicly\nlodged or are required to comply with AAS, but do not relate to entities that are publicly accountable.  \nBC47 As a general rule, the presentation requirements of full AAS have been retained, and the Board noted that it\ndid not intend to make any changes to the presentation requirements or accounting treatments available under\nAAS.  \nBC48 This applies in particular to the presentation requirements in AASB 101 and AASB 107 even though these\nStandards have been replaced in their entirety with AASB 1060 paragraphs 8 to 97. The only exception made\nrelates to the option of not presenting a separate statement of changes in equity as noted in paragraph BC62.  \nBC49 ED 295 further proposed to replace the presentation requirements of AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for\n_Sale and Discontinued Operations with those included in the_ _IFRS for SMEs Standard. However, after_\nconsidering the feedback received on ED 295, the Board decided to amend the proposals to align the\npresentation requirements in AASB 1060 with those in AASB 5. This will ensure consistency in the\npresentation of discontinued operations between Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities and is consistent with the overall\nintention to retain the presentation requirements from full AAS and only adopt the IFRS for SMEs disclosures.  \nBC50 The Board noted that any future changes made to AAS will be assessed using the above principles, to\ndetermine whether and how the changes would require amendments to AASB 1060. Where necessary,\namendments to AASB 1060 will be made in time to ensure they are effective at the same time as the\namendments to the full AAS. This will ensure AASB 1060 will continue to be appropriately aligned with the\nrequirements of full AAS.",

Making AASB 1060 applicable to all Tier 2 entities, whether for-profit or NFP, will result in\nan immediate reduction in disclosures compared to the current RDR framework, and NFP private sector\nentities will be able to benefit from this reduction in disclosures while waiting for legislative action on the\nACNC legislative review recommendations and for a revised NFP Financial Reporting Framework to be  \n-----  developed[9]. Similarly, public sector entities will also benefit while consideration is being given to improving\npublic sector financial reporting[10]. The Tier 2 disclosure framework may still be relevant to NFP entities as\none of the tiers of reporting for that sector even after a revised NFP Financial Reporting Framework is\ndeveloped.  \nBC52 While respondents to ED 295 had suggested deferring the mandatory date of AASB 1060 for NFP entities\npossibly until the NFP private and public sector financial reporting frameworks have been finalised, the Board\ndecided against different application dates to avoid the confusion for users that would come from having two\nTier 2 reporting frameworks in operation at the same time.  \nBC53 In determining whether disclosures would need to be added to address any R&M differences that are specific\nto NFP private sector and public sector entities, the Board has applied paragraph 28 of the AASB\u2019s Not-for_Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and the principles listed in paragraphs BC41 and BC42 above._\nWhile those principles have been developed with a specific focus on the users of the financial statements of\nprivate sector entities, the Board considers that they are also relevant to the users of the financial statements\nof NFP entities. However, the Board also acknowledged that certain transactions or items in the financial\nstatements are unique to NFP entities and may require additional information, as set out in the AASB\u2019s Not_for-Profit Entity Standard Setting Framework. A limited number of disclosures have been added to_\nAASB 1060 for that reason.

New paragraphs 20A and 20B are added to AASB 1057 _Application of_\n_Australian Accounting Standards_ to note that entities applying this Standard do not need to comply with\nAASB 7 Financial Instruments:Disclosures, AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, AASB 101,\nAASB 107 and AASB 124. These Standards will be replaced with the following sections from the IFRS for\n_SMEs Standard:_  \n(a) Financial Statement Presentation (AASB 101): paragraphs 8 \u2013 33  \n(b) Statement of Financial Position (AASB 101): paragraphs 34 \u2013 47  \n(c) Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income (AASB 101): paragraphs 48 \u2013 58  \n(d) Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Income and Retained Earnings (AASB 101):\nparagraphs 59 \u2013 63  \n(e) Statement of Cash Flows (AASB 107): paragraphs 64 \u2013 89  \n(f) Notes to the Financial Statements (AASB 101): paragraphs 90 \u2013 103  \n(g) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (AASB 12): paragraphs 104 \u2013 105  \n(h) Basic Financial Instruments (AASB 7): paragraphs 111 \u2013 119  \n(i) Other Financial Instruments Issues (AASB 7): paragraphs 120 \u2013 122  \n(j) Investments in Associates (AASB 12): paragraphs 125 \u2013 128  \n(k) Investments in Joint Ventures (AASB 12): paragraphs 129 \u2013 131  \n(l) Related Party Disclosures (AASB 124): paragraphs 189 \u2013 203  \nBC55 The Board noted that by replacing the five Standards listed in paragraph BC54, this also removes some of the\nguidance included in these Standards which is not included in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. However, for the\nsake of maintaining simplicity of the disclosure requirements, the Board considered this to be preferable to\nconsidering on a case-by-case basis which guidance should be included and which could be omitted. As noted\nin paragraph BC47, the Board does not intend the removal of the guidance to result in any differences in the\npresentation requirements to full AAS. However, in response to stakeholder feedback, the Board added\nparagraph 2 which specifically permits entities to refer to other Standards for guidance on requirements in\nthis Standard. The Board also added the definitions from the replaced Standards in Appendix A.  \n9 See AASB Discussion Paper: Improving Financial Reporting for Australian Charities  \n10 See AASB Discussion Paper: Improving Financial Reporting for Australian Public Sector  \n-----  BC56 To prevent possible differences in presentation requirements to full AAS, the Board further decided to add\nthe following requirements from AASB 101, AASB 107 and AASB 124 to AASB 1060 which deal with:  \n(a) the prohibition for Australian entities that apply AASB 1060 to depart from a requirement in an\nAustralian Accounting Standard (paragraph 12 in this Standard and paragraph Aus19.1 in\nAASB 101);  \n(b) the specific prohibition to offset assets and liabilities or income and expenses, unless required or\npermitted by an Australian Accounting Standard (paragraph 24 in this standard and paragraph 32\nin AASB 101);  \n(c) the option to present the net cash flow from operating activities under the indirect method by\nshowing the revenues and expenses disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income and the\nchanges during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables (paragraph 72 in\nthis standard and paragraph 20 in AASB 107);  \n(d) options to report certain cash flows on a net basis (paragraphs 75 to 78 in this Standard and\nparagraphs 22\u221224 in AASB 107);  \n(e) the exemption from the disclosure of key management personnel compensation where the entity\nobtains key management personnel services from another entity (paragraphs 195 and 196 in this\nstandard and paragraphs 17A and 18A in AASB 124).  \nBC57 The prohibition to depart from a requirement in an Australian Accounting Standard reflects Australian\nspecific circumstances which are also relevant to Tier 2 entities and hence needs to be included. Paragraphs\n3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard have been deleted, as they are not relevant to entities applying\nthis Standard.  \nBC58 The offsetting prohibition in paragraph BC56(b) is included in Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles\nof the _IFRS for SMEs Standard (paragraph 2.52). As this section has been otherwise excluded from this_\nStandard on the basis that it does not include any disclosures, the prohibition had to be separately added to\nthis Standard.  \nBC59 Permitting the options in the presentation of the cash flow statement from AASB 107 ensures that there are\nno differences in presentation to full AAS and avoids any possible issues, for example for the consolidation\nof subsidiaries that report under Tier 2 by parent entities that report under Tier 1 (full AAS).  \nBC60 Retaining the exemption from disclosing key management personnel compensation in paragraph BC56(e) for\nentities that obtain key management personnel services from another entity avoids having potentially more\nonerous disclosure requirements than for Tier 1 entities. While arguably the exemption in paragraph 17A of\nAASB 124 (paragraph 195 in this Standard) only provides relief from disclosing the breakdown of key\nmanagement personnel compensation that is otherwise required to be disclosed by AASB 124 paragraph 17,\nthe Board noted that the fees paid to a management entity that must be disclosed under paragraph 18A of\nAASB 124 (paragraph 196 in this Standard) may also cover other services, and that the fees many not\nspecifically identify the amount relating to key management personnel services.  \nBC61 To avoid any potential R&M differences, the Board further decided to replace the definition of materiality in\nthe _IFRS for SMEs Standard with the recently updated definition of material from AASB 101 and added_\nparagraph 23 which clarifies the application of materiality (based on paragraph 31 in AASB 101). The Board\nalso replaced the guidance on the presentation of information in the notes (structure of notes, paragraph 93 in\nthis standard and paragraph 8.4 in the _IFRS for SMEs_ Standard) with the revised guidance from\nparagraphs 114 and 116 of AASB 101 that was introduced via amendments to AASB 101 in 2015 and added\nadditional guidance to paragraph 40 confirming that the terms of a liability that could, at the option of the\ncounterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification (from\nparagraph 69(d) of AASB 101). This will further ensure that there are no presentation differences to full AAS.  \nBC62 Consistent with the basic approach of minimising differences to the disclosures in the _IFRS for SMEs_\nStandard, the Board decided to retain paragraph 3.18 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard which includes an option\nof not presenting a statement of changes in equity if the only changes to equity during the periods for which\nfinancial statements are presented arise from profit or loss, payment of dividends, corrections of prior period\nerrors, and changes in accounting policy (paragraph 26 in this Standard).  \nBC63 In relation to the replacement of AASB 12, the Board noted that the investment entity exemption from\nconsolidation creates a R&M difference to the IFRS for SMEs Standard. However, based on the principles\nlisted in paragraph BC41, the Board did not consider that additional disclosures would be warranted in relation\nto this exemption. The Board noted that the IASB discussed the investment entity exception in the context of\nthe 2020 Request for Information Comprehensive Review of the IFRS for SMEs Standard and concluded that\nfew entities eligible to apply the _IFRS for SMEs Standard would be investment entities. The Board also_\nexpects the exemption to have limited practical impact, since the majority of investment entities will be\npublicly accountable and therefore not able to apply this Standard.  \n-----  BC64 In responding to stakeholders\u2019 concerns that an investment entity preparing separate financial statements\ncould not comply with paragraph 105 of this Standard because the paragraph requires the entity to identify\nthe consolidated financial statements or other primary financial statements to which the separate financial\nstatements relate, the Board noted that separate financial statements are defined in AASB 127 _Separate_\n_Financial Statements as financial statements that are presented in addition to consolidated financial statements_\nor to financial statements that apply equity-accounting to investments in associates or joint ventures\n(consistent with the definition of separate financial statements in the IFRS for SMEs Standard). Therefore, the\nfinancial statements prepared by investment entities would not be separate financial statements under that\ndefinition and as a result paragraph 105 would not apply.",

        "page_content=": "## Judgements made in adding, removing or adapting the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard  \nBC65 The Board has exercised a number of significant judgements while adding, removing and amending\ndisclosures from the certain sections of the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  \nBC66 In considering the R&M differences between AASB 16 Leases and Section 20 Leases in the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard, the Board noted that the accounting for all leases held by lessees under AASB 16 is broadly similar\nto the the accounting for finance leases in the _IFRS for SMEs Standard. As a consequence, the Board_\nconsidered that the disclosures for finance leases should be used as a basis, and only be adapted for different\nterminology used in AASB 16 (eg referring to variable lease payments instead of contingent rent).  \nBC67 The Board also decided in principle to adapt the current disclosures for operating leases to apply to shortterm leases and leases of low value assets that have not been recognised as right-of-use assets per the\nexemption in paragraph 6 of AASB 16. However, the Board noted that the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard about operating lease commitments are more extensive than what is required under paragraphs 55\nand 60 of AASB 16. AASB 16 is a recent Standard that was finalised after the IFRS for SMEs Standard was\ndeveloped. As noted in paragraph BC40, the Board considered that where the IASB has removed disclosures\nfrom full IFRS after the IFRS for SMEs Standard was finalised, similar reductions in disclosures should also\nbe carried over to the new Tier 2 Standard. Therefore, the Board decided to replace the disclosures in the\n_IFRS for SMEs Standard with the relevant disclosures from AASB 16._  \nBC68 In considering the R&M differences between AASB 15 and Section 23 _Revenue in the_ _IFRS for SMEs_\nStandard, the Board noted that while the differences may affect the amount and timing of the revenue\nrecognised, under both AASB 15 and Section 23, revenue is either recognised at a point in time or over time.\nOn that basis, the Board decided to adapt the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard to reflect the different\nterminology used in AASB 15 but without adding unnecessary details. For example, the requirement to\ndisclose specified categories of revenue has been replaced with a requirement to disaggregate revenue into\ncategories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected\nby economic factors. The reference to \u201cmethods used to determine the stage of completion\u201d has been changed\nto \u201cmethods used to recognise revenue for performance obligations that are satisfied over time\u201d.  \nBC69 In considering the difference between AASB 123 Borrowing Costs and Section 25 Borrowing Costs in the\n_IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does not permit the capitalisation_\nof borrowing costs and therefore does not require any additional disclosures. As this is an R&M difference,\nthe Board decided to require disclosure of the amount of capitalised borrowing costs on the grounds that total\ninterest is an important element for a user to understand liquidity and solvency of an entity, and that\ninformation about these amounts capitalised would therefore be relevant. The Board further considered that\nthe benefits of this disclosure would exceed the cost, noting that it is was also required for RDR entities.  \nBC70 Based on the principle to avoid differences to the _IFRS for SMEs Standard as far as possible, the Board_\ndecided to retain certain disclosures even though they were not required for RDR entities. These include:\n(c) in relation to the section covering employee benefits, disclosures about termination benefits which\nare over and above what is required under full IFRS/AAS (paragraphs 173(d),(g), 174-175);  \n(d) disclosures about the entity\u2019s domicile and other general information (paragraph 32), the qualitative\nfactors that make up goodwill (paragraph 142(g)), adjusting events that occurred after the end of\nthe reporting period (paragraph 185) and parent-subsidiary relationships where an entity applies\nthe exemption from providing related party disclosures for government-related entities (paragraph\n200);  \n(e) disclosures about hedging (paragraphs 121 and 122), investments in associates (paragraph 126) and\nleasing (paragraphs 144(b), 147(d) and 148(b)) where some disclosures were added but many\nothers removed as a result of applying the principles in paragraph BC41; and  \n(f) a number of disclosures in relation to the section covering transition to Australian Accounting\nStandards \u2013 Simplified Disclosures \u2013 see paragraph BC100 for details.  \n-----  BC71 While acknowledging stakeholders concerns about the potential increase in disclosures, the Board noted that\nthe small increases will be more than offset with the reduction in disclosures in other areas. On this basis, the\nBoard agreed to retain the disclosures from IFRS for SMEs Standard, which have been demonstrated to be\nappropriate for small and medium sized entities without public accountability. However, consistent with the\nprinciples in paragraph BC40, the Board agreed to remove disclosures about specific components of\ncapitalised defined benefit cost, group plans and other long-term benefits from the disclosures proposed in\nED 295 as these disclosures had been included in full IFRS when the IFRS for SMEs Standard was first issued,\nbut had since been removed from full IFRS.  \nBC72 In relation to the adjusting events after the end of the reporting period, the Board noted that paragraph 185\nspecifically refers to an update of \u2018related disclosures\u2019, which is different to the equivelant requirements in\nAASB 110 _Events after the Reporting Period,_ where paragraph 8 requires the adjustment of amounts\nrecognised in the financial statements and paragraphs 19 and 20 deal with disclosure-related adjustments.\nWhile RDR entities were not required to comply with paragraphs 19 and 20 of AASB 110, the Board noted\nthat paragraph 185 refers only to disclosures that relate to amounts recognised in the financial statements and\nis therefore narrower than the requirements in paragraphs 19 and 20 of AASB 110. On that basis, the Board\ndid not consider the requirements to be particularly onerous and decided to retain them consistent with the\nprinciple of consistency with the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  \nBC73 In considering differences between AASB 138 Intangible Assets and Section 18 Intangible Assets other than\n_Goodwill in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does not permit_\nthe revaluation of intangible assets and therefore does not require relevant disclosures. The Board decided\nthat these disclosures would be relevant and should be added, using the disclosures for property plant and\nequipment from paragraph 17.33 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard as a basis. The Board also decided to add a\nrequirement to disclose the reason for an intangible asset having an indefinite useful life based on AASB 140\n_Investment Property paragraph 122(a), as this option is not available under the IFRS for SMEs Standard._  \nBC74 However, the IFRS for SMEs Standard also requires for revalued property, plant and equipment the disclosure\nof the carrying amount of the assets that would have been recognised under the cost model (paragraph\n17.33(d) in the IFRS for SMEs Standard). The Board noted that the option to use the revaluation model for\nproperty, plant and equipment was only introduced into the _IFRS for SMEs Standard as part of the_\namendments made in 2015. While the Basis for Conclusions to the amendments explain the reasons for\npermitting this option[11], they do not discuss the associated disclosures that were added in the process. When\nthe Board discussed this particular disclosure requirement in the context of the original RDR disclosures in\nED 192 Revised Differential Reporting Framework, it noted that the revaluation model provides more relevant\ninformation than the cost model, and that it would appear illogical and irrelevant to provide comparative\ninformation about the cost model[12]. The Board therefore concluded that the cost of this disclosure would\noutweigh the benefits. These arguments are still valid and on that basis the Board decided not to include this\nparticular disclosure from the IFRS from SMEs Standard.",

The Board decided that where_\nthis is the case, the entity shall apply the relevant specific transition disclosures that are required under that  \n13 Coulton, J., C. Ruddock and S.

        "page_content=": "## AASB Standards and Interpretations not covered in AASB 1060  \nBC88 There are a number of Standards that the Board decided not to address in this Standard for the following\nreasons:  \n(a) AASB 14 _Regulatory Deferral Accounts_ as it would only be relevant for entities that have\nrecognised regulatory deferral account balances under their current accounting policy (eg where\nthe entity prepared SPFS without complying with the R&M of full AAS). None of the respondents\nto ED 295 identified any entities that intend to apply AASB 14 on transition to GPFS. The Board\u2019s\ndecision also is consistent with IASB\u2019s view that it should not incorporate the requirements of\nIFRS 14 as part of the current comprehensive review of the IFRS for SMEs Standard[14];  \n(b) AASB 4 _Insurance Contracts, AASB 17_ _Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023_ _General Insurance_\n_Contracts, AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contarcts and AASB 1056 Superannuation Entities are not_\naddressed in this Standard as the majority of the entities applying these Standards would have\npublic accountability by holding assets in a fiduciary capacity.  \nThe Board acknowledged that AASB 4 and AASB 17 would also be applicable to entities such as\n\u2018captive insurers\u2019 which may not be publicly accountable and hence would be eligible to apply this\nStandard. These entities will have to provide the full disclosures of AASB 4 or AASB 17, as the\ndisclosures in these standards have not been replaced by AASB 1060. However, the Board was of\nthe view that \u2018captive insurers\u2019 deal only with insurance contracts within their own group and as a\nresult are likely to have relatively simple insurance arrangements. They would therefore not be\nunduly impacted by the full disclosure requirements under these Standards.  \nIn relation to AASB 1056, the Board concluded that superannuation entities are currently divided\nbetween Tier 1 entities and non-reporting entities (including Small Australian Prudential\nRegulation Authority (APRA) Funds (SAFs) and Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs)).\nAccordingly, Tier 2 disclosures were not developed for these entities. The Board further noted that\nthere is currently no legislative requirements for superannuation entities to prepare financial\nstatements in accordance with AAS. Until such time as the legislation is changed, superannaution\nentities could therefore continue preparing SPFS and thus AASB 1056 has been excluded from this\nStandard.  \n(c) AASB 8 Operating Segments and AASB 133 Earnings per Share require disclosure of segment\ninformation and of earnings per share data only for entities which have debt or equity instruments\nthat are traded, or are in the process of being issued for trading in a public market. These entities\nwould have public accountability and, accordingly, the Board decided that these Standards are not\napplicable for Tier 2 entities. Instead, consistent with the IFRS for SMEs Standard, paragraph 33\nrefers back to these Standards and provides that an entity disclosing segment information or\nearnings per share must comply with AASB 8 or AASB 133 respectively in full.  \n(d) AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting is applicable for the specific purpose of preparing interim\nfinancial reports and AASB 1039 Concise Financial Reports is applicable for the specific purpose\nof preparing concise reports under the Corporations Act 2001. AASB 1060 is intended to be used\nin the preparation of annual GPFS. Accordingly, the Board considered that AASB 134 and\nAASB 1039 are not relevant in relation to this disclosure Standard.  \n14 IASB Request for Information Comprehensive Review of the IFRS for SMEs Standard \u2013 N1  \n-----  (e) The majority of the disclosures from AASB 1054 are now covered in AASB 1060: paragraphs 7\nand 8 of AASB 1054 are covered in paragraphs 10\u201311 of AASB 1060, paragraphs 10 and 11 of\nAASB 1054 are covered in paragraphs 98 and 99 of AASB 1060 as discussed in paragraph BC75\nand paragraphs 12\u201315 of AASB 1054 are covered in paragraphs 100\u2013103 of AASB 1060 as\ndiscussed in paragraphsBC83\u2013BC84. Paragraph 9 of AASB 1054 will no longer be relevant as it\nrefers to SPFS and paragraph 16 of AASB 1054 does not provide information about short-term\ncash flows, obligations, commitment, contingencies, liquidity or solvency and is therefore not\nrequired.  \n(f) AASB 1057 and AASB 1053 do not include any R&M or disclosure requirements and as a result\nhave not been included in this Standard.  \nBC89 In assessing whether disclosure requirements of a particular AASB Interpretation would need to be added to\nAASB 1060, the Board has considered the following:  \n(a) If the Basis for Conclusions in the IFRS for SMEs Standard confirmed that particular interpretations\nhad been incorporated in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, no further action was required.  \n(b) No action was required for interprations that have been superseded or do not have any disclosure\nrequirements.  \nBC90 The Board further considered whether disclosure requirements from AASB Interpretations would need to be\nadded to AASB 1060 but concluded this was not necessary for the following reasons:for the following\nreasons:  \n(a) AASB Interpretation 1019 The Superannuation Contributions Surcharge and AASB Interpretation\n1047 Professional Indemnity Claims Liabilities in Medical Defence Organisations are not relevant\nfor Tier 2 entities, as entities applying these interpretations would have public accountability by\nholding assets in a fiduciary capacity.  \n(b) The disclosures in AASB Interpretation 1052 _Tax Consolidation Accounting Disclosure_ were\nexcluded for RDR entities on the basis of cost-benefit considerations. In addition, as the\ninterpretation is not creating any R&M differences to IAS 12, and therefore also not to the IFRS\n_for SMEs Standard, the Board concluded that additional disclosures will not be required._  \n(c) The disclosure paragraphs in AASB Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments do\nnot introduce new disclosures, but refer to disclosures in the AASB 112 that are captured in\nparagraphs 96, 97 and 154 of AASB 1060.  \n(d) Two of the three disclosure paragraphs in AASB Interpretation 5 Rights to Interests arising from\n_Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds were already excluded for_\nTier 2 entities on the basis of cost-benefit considerations. However, as there are also no R&M\ndifferences to the _IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board concluded that no additional disclosures_\nwould be required.",

        "page_content=": "## Reasons for proposing amendments to AASB 1060  \nBC2 In June 2020, the Board issued AASB 2020-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Covid-19_Related Rent Concessions to make amendments to AASB 16_ _Leases to provide lessees with an optional_\nexemption from assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. The\namendments added a new paragraph 60A to AASB 16, which requires an entity applying the practical\nexpedient to disclose:  \n(a) that it has applied the practical expedient to all rent concessions that meet the conditions in\nparagraph 46B of AASB 16 or, if not applied to all such rent concessions, information about the\nnature of the contracts to which it has applied the practical expedient; and  \n(b) the amount recognised in profit or loss for the reporting period to reflect changes in lease payments\nthat arise from rent concessions to which the lessee has applied the practical expedient in paragraph\n46A of AASB 16.  \nBC3 The amendments further provide relief from providing the information required by AASB 108 Accounting\n_Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors paragraph 28(f) in the reporting period in which the_\nlessee first applies the amendments made by AASB 2020-4 through paragraph C20B of AASB 16.  \nBC4 The Board considered whether these disclosures should also apply to entities that intend to adopt AASB 1060\n_General Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2_\n_Entities. The Board referred to the principles used when developing the disclosures in AASB 1060, which are_\ndescribed in paragraphs BC34\u2013BC50 in the Basis for Conclusions to that Standard. In particular:  \n(a) the disclosures in the _IFRS for SMEs Standard should be retained where the recognition and_\nmeasurement (R&M) requirements and options are the same or similar in the _IFRS for SMEs_\nStandard and full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards);  \n(b) where R&M options or treatments in the IFRS for SMEs Standard are not available in full IFRS\nStandards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards), the related IFRS for SMEs disclosures\nare removed; and  \n(c) where the R&M principles in full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards)\nare significantly different from those in the _IFRS for SMEs Standard or certain topics are not_\naddressed in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, disclosures may be added. To determine whether to add\nany disclosures, the Board refers to the principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures\nin the IFRS for SMEs Standard, which are set out in paragraph BC8 below.  \nIn addition to applying these principles, the Board also considers whether to add disclosures to address matters\nof public policy or to reflect Australian-specific issues.  \nBC5 Based on these principles, the Board agreed to use the following approach when considering whether to add\nto or amend disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 in relation to amendments made by the IASB to full IFRS\nStandards:  \n(a) if the amendments introduce significant R&M differences between full IFRS Standards and the\n_IFRS for SMEs Standard, apply the principles applied by the IASB in developing the_ _IFRS for_\n_SMEs Standard, as summarised in paragraph BC8;_  \n-----  (b) if the amendments do not introduce significant R&M differences, no further action is required\nunless the disclosures address a matter of public policy or are of particular relevance in the\nAustralian environment.  \nBC6 In relation to the COVID-19-related rent concessions, the Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does\nnot discuss how to account for lease modifications. Paragraph 10.4 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard explains\nthat management shall use its judgement in developing and applying accounting policies that result in relevant\nand reliable information. Paragraph 10.6 further states that in making the judgement, management may also\nconsider the requirements and guidance in full IFRS Standards dealing with similar and related issues. It is\ntherefore possible that the expedient provided under full IFRS Standards may not result in significant\ndifferences in the R&M requirements. On that basis, it would arguably not be necessary to consider whether\nto add any disclosures to AASB 1060.  \nBC7 However, as the practical expedient introduces a significant exemption from the accounting principles in\nAASB 16 that is only available to entities in the limited circumstances set out in AASB 16 paragraph 46B,\nthe Board was of the view that this would be a situation where additional disclosures may be warranted.  \nBC8 The Board therefore referred to the principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS\n_for SMEs Standard. These principles consider that users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that_\nare not publicly accountable are particularly interested in information about:  \n(a) short-term cash flows and obligations, commitments or contingencies, whether or not recognised\nas liabilities;  \n(b) liquidity and solvency;  \n(c) measurement uncertainties;  \n(d) accounting policy choices; and  \n(e) disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements.  \nThe principles further note that some disclosures in full IFRS Standards are more relevant to investment\ndecisions in public capital markets than to transactions and other events and conditions encountered by entities\nwithout public accountability.  \nBC9 Applying the practical expedient in AASB 16 paragraph 46A is an accounting policy choice. Entities would\ntherefore already be required to explain if they have used the expedient, and to what extent, when describing\ntheir accounting policies and the basis of preparation of their financial statements under paragraph 95(b) of\nAASB 1060. However, the Board noted that adding a specific disclosure requirement to AASB 1060 would\nensure all entities applying the expedient state this fact in their basis of preparation, regardless of whether\nthey are reporting under Tier 1 or Tier 2. Providing information about accounting policy choices made by the\nentity is further supported by the principle in paragraph BC8(d).  \nBC10 In relation to the amount recognised in profit or loss for the reporting period, the Board noted that this provides\ninformation about the disaggregation of amounts presented in the statement of profit or loss, and is hence\nsupported by paragraph BC8(e). The disclosure may also provide further insights about the entity\u2019s liquidity\nand solvency (paragraph BC8(b)) and would improve the comparability of financial statements of lessees that\nhave applied the practical expedient and those that have not.  \nBC11 Furthermore, if the entity had applied AASB 16 in a prior period, adopting the practical expedient would be\na change in accounting policy and the entity would have to disclose the impact of this change on the current\nand prior periods under paragraph 28(f) of AASB 108, but for the disclosure relief added to AASB 16\n(paragraph C20B) by AASB 2020-4. Noting that there should be no impact on prior periods as the practical\nexpedient is limited to COVID-19-related rent concessions, disclosing the amount recognised in profit or loss\nfor the reporting period would provide essentially the same information as required under AASB 1060\nparagraph 106(b), which is the equivalent paragraph to AASB 108 paragraph 28(f). Requiring disclosure of\nthe amount recognised in profit or loss but providing relief from compliance with paragraph 106(b) would\ntherefore not result in any additional disclosures being required under AASB 1060.  \nBC12 Considering that the proposed new requirements are not expected to result in an increase in disclosures, the\nBoard agreed to propose amendments to AASB 1060 that would replicate the disclosure changes made to\nAASB 16 and AASB 108 by AASB 2020-4. The Board further noted that the additional disclosures would\napply only to COVID-19-related rent concessions and were warranted because of the special circumstances\nleading to the practical expedient in AASB 16. The amendments do not alter the fact that disclosure of variable\nlease payments is not required under the IFRS for SMEs Standard and therefore also not required under\nAASB 1060.  \n-----  ",

Disclosure\nof the accounting policies applied by the entity is already required under AASB 101 Presentation of Financial\n_Statements paragraph 117(b), and without the relief introduced by paragraph C20B of AASB 16, entities that_\nhad previously applied AASB 16 would need to disclose the impact of the change in accounting policy on\neach financial statement line item affected.  \nBC15 On that basis, the Board took the view that the additional disclosures introduced by AASB 16 paragraph 60A\nshould not be reduced for Tier 2 RDR entities and the disclosure relief in paragraph C20B should be available\nto such entities. This approach would mean that no further changes would need to be made to AASB 16 in\nrelation to Tier 2 RDR.",

        "page_content=": "## Reasons for not adding any disclosures to AASB 1060  \nBC4 The Board considered whether the new disclosures should also apply to entities that intend to adopt\nAASB 1060 _General Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-_\n_Profit Tier 2 Entities._ The Board referred to the principles used when developing the disclosures in\nAASB 1060, in particular:  \n(a) the disclosures in the _IFRS for SMEs_ Standard should be retained where the recognition and\nmeasurement (R&M) requirements and options are the same or similar in the _IFRS for SMEs_\nStandard and full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards);  \n(b) where R&M options or treatments in the IFRS for SMEs Standard are not available in full IFRS\nStandards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards), the related IFRS for SMEs disclosures\nare removed; and  \n(c) where the R&M principles in full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards)\nare significantly different from those in the _IFRS for SMEs_ Standard or certain topics are not\naddressed in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, disclosures may be added. To determine whether to add\nany disclosures, the Board refers to the principles applied by the International Accounting\nStandards Board (IASB) in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, which are\nset out in paragraph BC5.  \nIn addition to applying these principles, the Board also considers whether to add disclosures to address matters\nof public policy or to reflect Australian-specific issues.  \nBC5 The principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard consider\nthat users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not publicly accountable are particularly\ninterested in information about:  \n(a) short-term cash flows and obligations, commitments or contingencies, whether or not recognised\nas liabilities;  \n(b) liquidity and solvency;  \n-----  (c) measurement uncertainties;  \n(d) accounting policy choices; and  \n(e) disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements.  \nThe principles further note that some disclosures in full IFRS Standards are more relevant to investment\ndecisions in public capital markets than to transactions and other events and conditions encountered by entities\nwithout public accountability.  \nBC6 Based on these principles of the Board and the IASB, the Board agreed to use the following approach when\nconsidering whether to add to or amend disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 in relation to amendments\nmade by the IASB to full IFRS Standards:  \n(a) if the amendments introduce significant R&M differences between full IFRS Standards and the\n_IFRS for SMEs_ Standard, apply the principles applied by the IASB in developing the _IFRS for_\n_SMEs Standard, as summarised in paragraph BC5; and_  \n(b) if the amendments do not introduce significant R&M differences, no further action is required\nunless the disclosures address a matter of public policy or are of particular relevance in the\nAustralian environment.  \nBC7 The Board therefore considered whether the amendments made to AASB 9 Financial Instruments, AASB 4\n_Insurance Contracts, AASB 16 Leases and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement_\nby AASB 2020-8 will result in significant R&M differences to the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  \n**Differences arising from the practical expedient for particular changes to**\n**contractual cash flows**  \nBC8 The Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does not deal with the impact of interest rate benchmark\nreform on financial reporting or provide a practical expedient for similar situations. The amendments to\nAASB 9 mean that the changes made to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of\ninterest rate benchmark reform are accounted for in the same way as the re-estimation of future interest\npayments on variable-rate financial assets and financial liabilities. In particular, the rules on accounting for\nmodifications of contractual cash flows in AASB 9 do not apply.  \nBC9 Paragraph 11.37 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard addresses substantial modifications only in the context of the\nderecognition of financial liabilities. However, given the IASB concluded that it would be unlikely that the\ntransition to an alternative benchmark rate alone would result in the derecognition of a financial instrument,\nthese requirements are not relevant for the assessment outlined in paragraph BC6. In terms of accounting for\nother modifications under the _IFRS for SMEs Standard, an entity\u2019s management would need to apply_\nparagraph 10.4 and use its judgement in developing and applying accounting policies that result in relevant\nand reliable information. Paragraph 10.6 further states that in making the judgement, management may also\nconsider the requirements and guidance in full IFRS Standards dealing with similar and related issues. The\nBoard considered this could include the practical expedient for the interest rate benchmark reform in AASB 9.  \nBC10 The Board also noted that AASB 4 is not addressed in AASB 1060 as the majority of the entities applying\nAASB 4 would have public accountability. In respect of the amendments made to AASB 16 in relation to\nlease modifications required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Board considered that the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard does not discuss how to account for lease modifications. For the same reasons as set out in paragraph\nBC9, the Board concluded that the expedient introduced by the amendments to AASB 16 should not result in\na significant R&M difference. In any case, the Board noted that there are no additional disclosures associated\nwith the application of the practical expedient for leases.  \nBC11 The Board therefore concluded that the modifications arising as a result of interest rate benchmark reform\nshould not result in significant R&M differences between the amended IFRS Standards and the _IFRS for_\n_SMEs Standard that would warrant additional disclosures for Tier 2 entities applying the new Simplified_\nDisclosures framework in AASB 1060.  \n**Differences arising from the relief from specific hedge accounting**\n**requirements**  \nBC12 The Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard permits hedge accounting only for four specific types of\ninstruments listed in the Standard, including interest rate swaps. While the IFRS for SMEs Standard is less\nrestrictive regarding the types of risks that can qualify for hedge accounting and hedge ineffectiveness, it\nrequires an entity to discontinue hedge accounting if:  \n(a) the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated;  \n-----  (b) the hedge no longer meets the conditions for hedge accounting specified in paragraph 12.16; or  \n(c) the entity revokes the designation.  \nBC13 In the IFRS Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\u2014Phase 2 amendments, the IASB observed that amending the\nformal designation of a hedging relationship to reflect changes required by the reform would result in the\nhedging relationship being discontinued. The Board noted this is because both AASB 9 (paragraph 6.4.1) and\nAASB 139 (paragraph 88) require the formal designation of a hedging relationship to be documented at\ninception as part of the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting to be applied. The hedge documentation\nincludes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and\nhow the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. Although in limited circumstances AASB 9 permits the hedge\ndocumentation to be updated without resulting in the discontinuation of hedge accounting, AASB 139\nrequires hedge accounting to be discontinued when any amendments are made to the hedge designation as\ndocumented at the inception of the hedging relationship.  \nBC14 The Board further noted that the term \u201cat inception\u201d is a notable omission in the IFRS for SMEs Standard.\nGiven the absence of an explicit reference to the formal designation and documentation at the inception of a\nhedge in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board took the view that changes to hedge designations and hedge\ndocumentation that are required as a result of the reform would not necessarily result in the discontinuation\nof hedge accounting under the _IFRS for SMEs Standard. The relief from specific hedge accounting_\nrequirements introduced by the amendments to AASB 9 and AASB 139 is therefore unlikely to result in\nsignificant R&M differences.",

The Board_\nconsidered this further supports the argument that no additional disclosures from AASB 2020-8 should be\nrequired, as an entity applying the IFRS for SMEs Standard and IAS 39 or IFRS 9 would apply the Interest\n_Rate Benchmark Reform\u2014Phase 2 amendments and not be required to provide any additional disclosures_\nunder the view in the Request for Information.  \nBC16 The Board further considered whether the new disclosure requirements added to AASB 7 address a matter of\npublic policy or are of particular relevance to the Australian environment but did not consider this to be the\ncase. Finally, the Board noted that should interest rate benchmark reform have a material effect on an entity\nsuch that knowledge about the financial effects is necessary for an understanding of the financial statements,\ndisclosure would still be required under the general provisions of paragraph 91 in AASB 1060.  \nBC17 On that basis, the Board took the view that the additional disclosures introduced by AASB 7 paragraphs 24I\nand 24J should not be added to AASB 1060.",

        "page_content=": "## Tier 2 Reduced Disclosure Requirements  \nBC19 The Board also considered whether the new disclosure requirements in AASB 7 should be reduced for entities\nreporting under the Tier 2 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR) framework (Tier 2 RDR entities). In\ndoing so, the Board referred to the \u2018user need\u2019 and \u2018cost-benefit\u2019 principles set out in the \u2018Tier 2 Disclosure\nPrinciples\u2019 document of the RDR decision-making framework. These principles were also based on the\nprinciples applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard and are the same\nas those summarised in paragraph BC5.  \nBC20 The Board noted the disclosures would affect only those Tier 2 RDR entities with financial instruments such\nas variable-rate loans that are referenced to the interest rate benchmarks, including those that have designated\nhedging instruments in a hedge relationship, lessees with IBOR-linked leases and insurance companies  \n-----  applying the temporary exemption from AASB 9 with IBOR-linked insurance contracts. The Board does not\nexpect many Tier 2 entities to be affected.  \nBC21 The Board further considered that the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 24I and 24J(a) and (c) of AASB 7\nprovide further detail about the entity\u2019s risk management and hedging strategy. Tier 2 entities already disclose\nthis information under paragraphs 22A and 22B of AASB 7. The additional disclosures are therefore\nconsistent with the current level of RDR disclosures.  \nBC22 While Tier 2 entities applying RDR are not otherwise required to disclose quantitative information such as\nthat required by paragraph 24J(b) of AASB 7, the Board considered that the information is expected:  \n(a) to be available to an entity as a result of the implementation of the interest rate benchmark reform\nand therefore the preparation of such disclosure is not expected to be burdensome;  \n(b) not to be onerous as the requirements allow entities to choose the basis for disclosing the\nquantitative information, thereby being able to leverage information already available, which would\nreduce costs while still providing useful information; and  \n(c) to be required only for a limited period of time, as the application of the amendments in Phase 2 is\nassociated with changes to financial instruments or hedging relationships subject to a particular\nreformed benchmark interest rate.  \nBC23 The disclosure requirements in paragraphs 24I and 24J of AASB 7 also require further information about the\ndisaggregation of amounts presented in financial statements and the transactions and other events encountered\nby these entities. The Board referred to the Tier 2 Disclosure Principles summarised in paragraph BC5 and\nconsidered that where the amounts in question are material, user needs and the benefits of the information\nwould outweigh the limited cost of preparing the disclosures.  \nBC24 The Board further considered that entities applying the amendments should not be required to disclose the\ninformation otherwise required by paragraph 28(f) of AASB 108. As this relief is provided to entities\nreporting under the Tier 1 framework, the Board took the view that it should also be available for Tier 2\nentities applying RDR so that they are not disadvantaged compared with entities reporting under Tier 1.  \nBC25 The Board noted that the proposals would result in different disclosure requirements for Tier 2 entities\napplying the RDR framework compared with Tier 2 entities applying the Simplified Disclosure framework\nunder AASB 1060. However, the Board considered this outcome would be consistent with the different\napproach used in developing AASB 1060 and the different starting points of the two Tier 2 disclosure\nframeworks. It demonstrates that the principles applied in developing the simplified disclosures can\nsuccessfully reduce the disclosures for Tier 2 entities. Furthermore, the Board does not expect many Tier 2\nentities to be affected by interest rate benchmark reform and noted that Tier 2 entities would be able to apply\nAASB 1060 early if they preferred not to make these particular disclosures. Therefore, the Board considered\nthe proposed disclosure requirements would not impose a significant burden on Tier 2 RDR entities.  \nBC26 On that basis, the Board took the view that the additional disclosure requirements introduced by AASB 7\nparagraphs 24I and 24J should not be reduced for Tier 2 RDR entities but that the relief from disclosing\ninformation about the financial effects of changes in accounting policy in paragraph 44HH should be available\nto such entities. This approach means that no further changes need to be made to AASB 7 in relation to Tier 2\nRDR.",

The feedback received indicated that, in general,\nall respondents were supportive of the proposals. However, some respondents suggested that:  \n(a) the Board should adopt a sector-neutral approach to transition relief. In their view, NFP entities\nshould have the same transition relief as for-profit private sector entities whether they are\ntransitioning from SPFS, Tier 1 or Tier 2 RDR and preparing Tier 2 SD for the first time; and  \n(b) consequently, AASB 1060 may not be the best place for the proposed amendments, given their\nsupport for additional transitional relief for NFP entities.  \nBC13 The Board considered this feedback and decided:  \n(a) to extend the relief from presenting comparative information for those disclosures not previously\nmade to also include transition from Tier 1 to Tier 2 SD. This was because both Tier 1 and Tier 2\nSD are prepared on the same recognition and measurement basis and there would be very few, if\nany, disclosures for which comparative information was not presented. Extending the relief would\ntherefore have a limited impact on comparability and would provide consistent optional relief for\nNFP entities transitioning between types of general purpose financial statements;  \n(b) not to provide any relief to NFP entities transitioning from SPFS at this time. As noted in paragraphs\nBC7 and BC8, NFP entities are not currently required to transition from SPFS. The Board did\nhowever reaffirm that it intends to consider specific transition relief for NFP entities, including\nthose that may be required to transition from SPFS, as part of its NFP Private Sector Financial\nReporting Framework project; and  \n(c) AASB 1060 remained the most appropriate location for these amendments. Although the optional\nrelief in this Standard no longer applies solely to NFP entities transitioning between Tier 2\nframeworks, the Board heard no compelling reasons to relocate the amendments from AASB 1060.\nNFP entities applying the optional relief will be transitioning to Tier 2 SD. Therefore, including\nthe relief in the applicable Tier 2 Standard (AASB 1060) remained appropriate.",

The intention of these paragraphs is to assist entities in determining\nwhether accounting policy information is material to their financial statements.\nTherefore, the Board expected this guidance also to be useful for entities preparing Tier 2\nfinancial statements. As AASB 101 does not apply directly to entities applying\nAASB 1060 (paragraph 2 of AASB 1060 permits entities to refer to other Standards for\nguidance), the Board considered that a cross-reference to AASB 101 would be unhelpful\nto users of AASB 1060 and took the view that these paragraphs should be added to\nAASB 1060;  \n(b) AASB 134 and AASB Practice Statement 2 \u2013 no changes to AASB 1060 were required:  \n(i) AASB 134 applies to the preparation of interim financial reports, whereas AASB 1060\nis intended to be used in the preparation of annual general purpose financial statements.\nTherefore, AASB 1060 does not include any requirements equivalent to those in\nAASB 134; and  \n(ii) AASB Practice Statement 2 provides non-mandatory guidance to all entities on making\nmateriality judgments when preparing general purpose financial statements in\naccordance with Australian Accounting Standards. Therefore, AASB 1060 does not\ninclude any requirements equivalent to those in AASB Practice Statement 2; and  \n(c) AASB 108 \u2013 no changes to AASB 1060 were required.

Although the\nguidance might be helpful to users, the stakeholder was concerned that guidance paragraphs were\nnot included in AASB 1060 originally and was also unsure whether all of the guidance in proposed\nparagraphs 95A\u201395E was necessary. They were also concerned that inclusion of proposed\nparagraphs 95A\u201395E might create an expectation that guidance paragraphs would be added to\nAASB 1060 routinely in the future; and  \n(b) one stakeholder suggested the Board consider whether certain paragraphs in AASB 1060 requiring\naccounting policy information for specific transactions and balances are necessary, as disclosure of  \n-----  this information is already required by AASB 1060 paragraph 95.[2] They also suggested that if the\ndisclosure requirements were retained, it might be helpful for users of AASB 1060 if the Board\nclarified that the specific disclosures are required only where they are material to the financial\nstatements.  \nBC11 The Board considered the feedback and decided:  \n(a) not to add proposed paragraphs 95A\u201395E to AASB 1060.

However, for the sake of maintaining the simplicity of the disclosure requirements in\nAASB 1060, the Board considered this to be preferable to considering on a case-by-case basis\nwhich guidance should be included and which could be omitted.[3] Whilst the Board was unable to\nfollow the IASB approach in this case as the IFRS for SMEs Standard was last updated in 2015, on\nbalance the Board considered that including the proposed guidance paragraphs in AASB 1060 was\nnot necessary.

In their\nview, the amendment proposed to paragraph 40(d) in ED 323 implied that the statement is relevant\nto paragraph 40(d) but not to paragraphs 40(a) and 40(c).

The amendments would require a Tier 2 entity to include in its\nfinancial statements the same specific disclosures that AASB 2023-1 requires in the financial statements of\nentities applying Tier 1 reporting requirements. The Board considered the proposed disclosures would provide\nadditional information about the cash flows, liquidity and solvency of Tier 2 entities.",

        "page_content=": "## Feedback from respondents on ED 328 and international alignment  \nBC15 The Board received one formal comment letter on ED 328. The feedback received indicated that, in general,\nthe stakeholder was supportive of the proposals. However, the stakeholder provided additional feedback.  \nBC16 The stakeholder suggested that the disclosure objective in proposed paragraph 119A in ED 328 was\nunnecessary. The stakeholder observed that the IASB has not generally included disclosure objectives in the\n_IFRS for SMEs_ Accounting Standard and, therefore, the Board generally has also not previously included\ndisclosure objectives in AASB 1060. It also observed that not including disclosure objectives is consistent\nwith the approach proposed by the IASB in its Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures project.  \nBC17 The Board noted that the IASB has tentatively decided not to include the disclosure objective in its proposed\namendments to add supplier finance arrangement disclosures to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.  \nBC18 The Board considered this feedback and decided that, for consistency with the IASB\u2019s tentative approach, it\nwould not add the disclosure objective proposed in ED 328 to this Standard. As AASB 1060 was developed\nbased on the requirements in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, the Board considered that following\nthe IASB\u2019s tentative approach was appropriate. However, the Board noted its intention to monitor future IASB\ndecisions about supplier finance arrangement disclosures in the _IFRS for SMEs_ Accounting Standard and\nconsider whether further amendments are required to AASB 1060 at that time.  \nBC19 In considering the IASB\u2019s tentative approach and proposed amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting\nStandard and the forthcoming Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures Standard, the Board\nobserved that the IASB is not proposing to include:  \n(a) transition relief in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. The IASB does not consider transition\nrelief necessary as it expects to issue the amendments at least two years before their application\ndate. (The IASB has not yet considered whether transition relief may be required in the Subsidiaries\n_without Public Accountability: Disclosures_ Standard.) The Board, however, considered that it is\nnecessary to add transition relief to AASB 1060 given the short time frame between the issue of\nthese amendments and their application date. Consequently, the transition reliefs proposed in\nED 328 are included in paragraph 119C of this Standard; and  \n(b) the final sentence in paragraph 119A of this Standard in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.\nHowever, the IASB has tentatively decided to include this sentence in proposed amendments to the\n_Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures_ Standard. The Board considered the\nadditional information about some finance arrangements that are outside the scope of supplier\nfinance arrangements is useful for Tier 2 entities and decided to retain this information.  \n-----  ",
