        "page_content=": "### Shares  \n**19** **For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares shall be the**\n**weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.**  \n20 Using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period reflects the possibility\nthat the amount of shareholders\u2019 capital varied during the period as a result of a larger or smaller number of\nshares being outstanding at any time. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during\nthe period is the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, adjusted by the\nnumber of ordinary shares bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time-weighting factor.\nThe time-weighting factor is the number of days that the shares are outstanding as a proportion of the total\nnumber of days in the period; a reasonable approximation of the weighted average is adequate in many\ncircumstances.  \n21 Shares are usually included in the weighted average number of shares from the date consideration is\nreceivable (which is generally the date of their issue), for example:  \n(a) ordinary shares issued in exchange for cash are included when cash is receivable;  \n-----  (b) ordinary shares issued on the voluntary reinvestment of dividends on ordinary or preference\nshares are included when dividends are reinvested;  \n(c) ordinary shares issued as a result of the conversion of a debt instrument to ordinary shares are\nincluded from the date that interest ceases to accrue;  \n(d) ordinary shares issued in place of interest or principal on other financial instruments are included\nfrom the date that interest ceases to accrue;  \n(e) ordinary shares issued in exchange for the settlement of a liability of the entity are included from\nthe settlement date;  \n(f) ordinary shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of an asset other than cash are included\nas of the date on which the acquisition is recognised; and  \n(g) ordinary shares issued for the rendering of services to the entity are included as the services are\nrendered.  \nThe timing of the inclusion of ordinary shares is determined by the terms and conditions attaching to their\nissue. Due consideration is given to the substance of any contract associated with the issue.  \n22 Ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination are included in the\nweighted average number of shares from the acquisition date. This is because the acquirer incorporates into\nits statement of comprehensive income the acquiree\u2019s profits and losses from that date.  \n23 Ordinary shares that will be issued upon the conversion of a mandatorily convertible instrument are\nincluded in the calculation of basic earnings per share from the date the contract is entered into.  \n24 Contingently issuable shares are treated as outstanding and are included in the calculation of basic earnings\nper share only from the date when all necessary conditions are satisfied (ie the events have occurred).\nShares that are issuable solely after the passage of time are not contingently issuable shares, because the\npassage of time is a certainty. Outstanding ordinary shares that are contingently returnable (ie subject to\nrecall) are not treated as outstanding and are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share until\nthe date the shares are no longer subject to recall.  \n25 [Deleted]  \n**26** **The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period and for all periods**\n**presented shall be adjusted for events, other than the conversion of potential ordinary shares, that**\n**have changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in**\n**resources.**  \n27 Ordinary shares may be issued, or the number of ordinary shares outstanding may be reduced, without a\ncorresponding change in resources. Examples include:  \n(a) a capitalisation or bonus issue (sometimes referred to as a stock dividend);  \n(b) a bonus element in any other issue, for example a bonus element in a rights issue to existing\nshareholders;  \n(c) a share split; and  \n(d) a reverse share split (consolidation of shares).  \n28 In a capitalisation or bonus issue or a share split, ordinary shares are issued to existing shareholders for no\nadditional consideration. Therefore, the number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased without an\nincrease in resources. The number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event is adjusted for the\nproportionate change in the number of ordinary shares outstanding as if the event had occurred at the\nbeginning of the earliest period presented. For example, on a two-for-one bonus issue, the number of\nordinary shares outstanding before the issue is multiplied by three to obtain the new total number of\nordinary shares, or by two to obtain the number of additional ordinary shares.  \n29 A consolidation of ordinary shares generally reduces the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a\ncorresponding reduction in resources. However, when the overall effect is a share repurchase at fair value,\nthe reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding is the result of a corresponding reduction in\nresources. An example is a share consolidation combined with a special dividend. The weighted average\nnumber of ordinary shares outstanding for the period in which the combined transaction takes place is\nadjusted for the reduction in the number of ordinary shares from the date the special dividend is recognised.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "### Dilutive potential ordinary shares  \n**41** **Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to**\n**ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing**\n**operations.**  \n42 An entity uses profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity as the control\nnumber to establish whether potential ordinary shares are dilutive or antidilutive. Profit or loss from\ncontinuing operations attributable to the parent entity is adjusted in accordance with paragraph 12 and\nexcludes items relating to discontinued operations.  \n43 Potential ordinary shares are antidilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would increase earnings\nper share or decrease loss per share from continuing operations. The calculation of diluted earnings per\nshare does not assume conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an\nantidilutive effect on earnings per share.  \n44 In determining whether potential ordinary shares are dilutive or antidilutive, each issue or series of potential\nordinary shares is considered separately rather than in aggregate. The sequence in which potential ordinary\nshares are considered may affect whether they are dilutive. Therefore, to maximise the dilution of basic\nearnings per share, each issue or series of potential ordinary shares is considered in sequence from the most\ndilutive to the least dilutive, ie dilutive potential ordinary shares with the lowest \u2018earnings per incremental\nshare\u2019 are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation before those with a higher earnings per\nincremental share. Options and warrants are generally included first because they do not affect the\nnumerator of the calculation.  \n_Options, warrants and their equivalents_  \n**45** **For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, an entity shall assume the exercise of**\n**dilutive options and warrants of the entity. The assumed proceeds from these instruments shall be**\n**regarded as having been received from the issue of ordinary shares at the average market price of**\n**ordinary shares during the period. The difference between the number of ordinary shares issued and**\n**the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued at the average market price of ordinary**\n**shares during the period shall be treated as an issue of ordinary shares for no consideration.**  \n46 Options and warrants are dilutive when they would result in the issue of ordinary shares for less than the\naverage market price of ordinary shares during the period. The amount of the dilution is the average market\nprice of ordinary shares during the period minus the issue price. Therefore, to calculate diluted earnings per\nshare, potential ordinary shares are treated as consisting of both the following:  \n(a) a contract to issue a certain number of the ordinary shares at their average market price during the\nperiod. Such ordinary shares are assumed to be fairly priced and to be neither dilutive nor\nantidilutive. They are ignored in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.  \n(b) a contract to issue the remaining ordinary shares for no consideration. Such ordinary shares\ngenerate no proceeds and have no effect on profit or loss attributable to ordinary shares\noutstanding. Therefore, such shares are dilutive and are added to the number of ordinary shares\noutstanding in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.  \n47 Options and warrants have a dilutive effect only when the average market price of ordinary shares during\nthe period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants (ie they are \u2018in the money\u2019). Previously\nreported earnings per share are not retroactively adjusted to reflect changes in prices of ordinary shares.  \n-----  47A For share options and other share-based payment arrangements to which AASB 2 _Share-based Payment_\napplies, the issue price referred to in paragraph 46 and the exercise price referred to in paragraph 47 shall\ninclude the fair value (measured in accordance with AASB 2) of any goods or services to be supplied to the\nentity in the future under the share option or other share-based payment arrangement.  \n48 Employee share options with fixed or determinable terms and non-vested ordinary shares are treated as\noptions in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, even though they may be contingent on vesting.\nThey are treated as outstanding on the grant date. Performance-based employee share options are treated as\ncontingently issuable shares because their issue is contingent upon satisfying specified conditions in\naddition to the passage of time.  \n_Convertible instruments_  \n49 The dilutive effect of convertible instruments shall be reflected in diluted earnings per share in accordance\nwith paragraphs 33 and 36.  \n50 Convertible preference shares are antidilutive whenever the amount of the dividend on such shares declared\nin or accumulated for the current period per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic earnings\nper share. Similarly, convertible debt is antidilutive whenever its interest (net of tax and other changes in\nincome or expense) per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic earnings per share.  \n51 The redemption or induced conversion of convertible preference shares may affect only a portion of the\npreviously outstanding convertible preference shares. In such cases, any excess consideration referred to in\nparagraph 17 is attributed to those shares that are redeemed or converted for the purpose of determining\nwhether the remaining outstanding preference shares are dilutive. The shares redeemed or converted are\nconsidered separately from those shares that are not redeemed or converted.  \n_Contingently issuable shares_  \n52 As in the calculation of basic earnings per share, contingently issuable ordinary shares are treated as\noutstanding and included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the conditions are satisfied (ie\nthe events have occurred). Contingently issuable shares are included from the beginning of the period (or\nfrom the date of the contingent share agreement, if later). If the conditions are not satisfied, the number of\ncontingently issuable shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the number of\nshares that would be issuable if the end of the period were the end of the contingency period. Restatement is\nnot permitted if the conditions are not met when the contingency period expires.  \n53 If attainment or maintenance of a specified amount of earnings for a period is the condition for contingent\nissue and if that amount has been attained at the end of the reporting period but must be maintained beyond\nthe end of the reporting period for an additional period, then the additional ordinary shares are treated as\noutstanding, if the effect is dilutive, when calculating diluted earnings per share. In that case, the calculation\nof diluted earnings per share is based on the number of ordinary shares that would be issued if the amount\nof earnings at the end of the reporting period were the amount of earnings at the end of the contingency\nperiod. Because earnings may change in a future period, the calculation of basic earnings per share does not\ninclude such contingently issuable ordinary shares until the end of the contingency period because not all\nnecessary conditions have been satisfied.  \n54 The number of ordinary shares contingently issuable may depend on the future market price of the ordinary\nshares. In that case, if the effect is dilutive, the calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the\nnumber of ordinary shares that would be issued if the market price at the end of the reporting period were\nthe market price at the end of the contingency period. If the condition is based on an average of market\nprices over a period of time that extends beyond the end of the reporting period, the average for the period\nof time that has lapsed is used. Because the market price may change in a future period, the calculation of\nbasic earnings per share does not include such contingently issuable ordinary shares until the end of the\ncontingency period because not all necessary conditions have been satisfied.  \n55 The number of ordinary shares contingently issuable may depend on future earnings and future prices of the\nordinary shares. In such cases, the number of ordinary shares included in the diluted earnings per share\ncalculation is based on both conditions (ie earnings to date and the current market price at the end of the\nreporting period). Contingently issuable ordinary shares are not included in the diluted earnings per share\ncalculation unless both conditions are met.  \n56 In other cases, the number of ordinary shares contingently issuable depends on a condition other than\nearnings or market price (for example, the opening of a specific number of retail stores). In such cases,\nassuming that the present status of the condition remains unchanged until the end of the contingency period,  \n-----  the contingently issuable ordinary shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share\naccording to the status at the end of the reporting period.  \n57 Contingently issuable potential ordinary shares (other than those covered by a contingent share agreement,\nsuch as contingently issuable convertible instruments) are included in the diluted earnings per share\ncalculation as follows:  \n(a) an entity determines whether the potential ordinary shares may be assumed to be issuable on the\nbasis of the conditions specified for their issue in accordance with the contingent ordinary share\nprovisions in paragraphs 52\u201356; and  \n(b) if those potential ordinary shares should be reflected in diluted earnings per share, an entity\ndetermines their impact on the calculation of diluted earnings per share by following the\nprovisions for options and warrants in paragraphs 45\u201348, the provisions for convertible\ninstruments in paragraphs 49\u201351, the provisions for contracts that may be settled in ordinary\nshares or cash in paragraphs 58\u201361, or other provisions, as appropriate.  \nHowever, exercise or conversion is not assumed for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share\nunless exercise or conversion of similar outstanding potential ordinary shares that are not contingently\nissuable is assumed.  \n_Contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash_  \n**58** **When an entity has issued a contract that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash at the entity\u2019s**\n**option, the entity shall presume that the contract will be settled in ordinary shares, and the resulting**\n**potential ordinary shares shall be included in diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.**  \n59 When such a contract is presented for accounting purposes as an asset or a liability, or has an equity\ncomponent and a liability component, the entity shall adjust the numerator for any changes in profit or loss\nthat would have resulted during the period if the contract had been classified wholly as an equity\ninstrument. That adjustment is similar to the adjustments required in paragraph 33.  \n**60** **For contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash at the holder\u2019s option, the more dilutive**\n**of cash settlement and share settlement shall be used in calculating diluted earnings per share.**  \n61 An example of a contract that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash is a debt instrument that, on\nmaturity, gives the entity the unrestricted right to settle the principal amount in cash or in its own ordinary\nshares. Another example is a written put option that gives the holder a choice of settling in ordinary shares\nor cash.  \n_Purchased options_  \n62 Contracts such as purchased put options and purchased call options (ie options held by the entity on its own\nordinary shares) are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because including them\nwould be antidilutive. The put option would be exercised only if the exercise price were higher than the\nmarket price and the call option would be exercised only if the exercise price were lower than the market\nprice.  \n_Written put options_  \n**63** **Contracts that require the entity to repurchase its own shares, such as written put options and**\n**forward purchase contracts, are reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect**\n**is dilutive. If these contracts are \u2018in the money\u2019 during the period (ie the exercise or settlement price**\n**is above the average market price for that period), the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share**\n**shall be calculated as follows:**  \n**(a)** **it shall be assumed that at the beginning of the period sufficient ordinary shares will be**\n**issued (at the average market price during the period) to raise proceeds to satisfy the**\n**contract;**  \n**(b)** **it shall be assumed that the proceeds from the issue are used to satisfy the contract (ie to**\n**buy back ordinary shares); and**  \n**(c)** **the incremental ordinary shares (the difference between the number of ordinary shares**\n**assumed issued and the number of ordinary shares received from satisfying the contract)**\n**shall be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.**  \n-----  ",

If a rights issue is offered to all existing shareholders, the number of\nordinary shares to be used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods before the rights\nissue is the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue, multiplied by the following factor:  \nFair value per share immediately before the exercise of rights  \nTheoretical ex-rights fair value per share  \nThe theoretical ex-rights fair value per share is calculated by adding the aggregate fair value of the shares\nimmediately before the exercise of the rights to the proceeds from the exercise of the rights, and dividing by\nthe number of shares outstanding after the exercise of the rights. Where the rights are to be publicly traded\nseparately from the shares before the exercise date, fair value is measured at the close of the last day on\nwhich the shares are traded together with the rights.",

The class A preference shares are entitled to a cumulative annual dividend of CU7 per share starting\nin 20X4.  \nAt the time of issue, the market rate dividend yield on the class A preference shares was 7 per cent a year.

The issue price can be calculated by taking the present value of CU100,\ndiscounted at 7 per cent over a three-year period.  \nBecause the shares are classified as equity, the original issue discount is amortised to retained earnings using the\neffective interest method and treated as a preference dividend for earnings per share purposes.
