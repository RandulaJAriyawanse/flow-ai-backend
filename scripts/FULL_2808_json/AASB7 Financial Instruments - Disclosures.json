Hedge accounting disclosures shall provide\ninformation about:  \n(a) an entity\u2019s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk;  \n(b) how the entity\u2019s hedging activities may affect the amount, timing and uncertainty of its future cash\nflows; and  \n(c) the effect that hedge accounting has had on the entity\u2019s statement of financial position, statement\nof comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity.  \n21B An entity shall present the required disclosures in a single note or separate section in its financial statements.\nHowever, an entity need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere, provided that the\ninformation is incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to some other statement, such as\na management commentary or risk report, that is available to users of the financial statements on the same\nterms as the financial statements and at the same time. Without the information incorporated by crossreference, the financial statements are incomplete.  \n-----  21C When paragraphs 22A\u201324F require the entity to separate by risk category the information disclosed, the entity\nshall determine each risk category on the basis of the risk exposures an entity decides to hedge and for which\nhedge accounting is applied. An entity shall determine risk categories consistently for all hedge accounting\ndisclosures.  \n21D To meet the objectives in paragraph 21A, an entity shall (except as otherwise specified below) determine how\nmuch detail to disclose, how much emphasis to place on different aspects of the disclosure requirements, the\nappropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation, and whether users of financial statements need additional\nexplanations to evaluate the quantitative information disclosed. However, an entity shall use the same level\nof aggregation or disaggregation it uses for disclosure requirements of related information in this Standard\nand AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement.  \n_The risk management strategy_  \n22 [Deleted]  \n22A An entity shall explain its risk management strategy for each risk category of risk exposures that it decides to\nhedge and for which hedge accounting is applied. This explanation should enable users of financial statements\nto evaluate (for example):  \n(a) how each risk arises.  \n(b) how the entity manages each risk; this includes whether the entity hedges an item in its entirety for\nall risks or hedges a risk component (or components) of an item and why.  \n(c) the extent of risk exposures that the entity manages.  \n22B To meet the requirements in paragraph 22A, the information should include (but is not limited to) a description\nof:  \n(a) the hedging instruments that are used (and how they are used) to hedge risk exposures;  \n(b) how the entity determines the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging\ninstrument for the purpose of assessing hedge effectiveness; and  \n(c) how the entity establishes the hedge ratio and what the sources of hedge ineffectiveness are.  \n22C When an entity designates a specific risk component as a hedged item (see paragraph 6.3.7 of AASB 9) it\nshall provide, in addition to the disclosures required by paragraphs 22A and 22B, qualitative or quantitative\ninformation about:  \n(a) how the entity determined the risk component that is designated as the hedged item (including a\ndescription of the nature of the relationship between the risk component and the item as a whole);\nand  \n(b) how the risk component relates to the item in its entirety (for example, the designated risk\ncomponent historically covered on average 80 per cent of the changes in fair value of the item as a\nwhole).  \n_The amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows_  \n23 [Deleted]  \n23A Unless exempted by paragraph 23C, an entity shall disclose by risk category quantitative information to allow\nusers of its financial statements to evaluate the terms and conditions of hedging instruments and how they\naffect the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows of the entity.  \n23B To meet the requirement in paragraph 23A, an entity shall provide a breakdown that discloses:  \n(a) a profile of the timing of the nominal amount of the hedging instrument; and  \n(b) if applicable, the average price or rate (for example strike or forward prices etc) of the hedging\ninstrument.  \n23C In situations in which an entity frequently resets (ie discontinues and restarts) hedging relationships because\nboth the hedging instrument and the hedged item frequently change (ie the entity uses a dynamic process in\nwhich both the exposure and the hedging instruments used to manage that exposure do not remain the same\nfor long\u2014such as in the example in paragraph B6.5.24(b) of AASB 9) the entity:  \n(a) is exempt from providing the disclosures required by paragraphs 23A and 23B.  \n-----  (b) shall disclose:  \n(i) information about what the ultimate risk management strategy is in relation to those\nhedging relationships;

 \n(b) the line item in the statement of financial position that includes the hedging instrument;  \n(c) the change in fair value of the hedging instrument used as the basis for recognising hedge\nineffectiveness for the period; and  \n(d) the nominal amounts (including quantities such as tonnes or cubic metres) of the hedging\ninstruments.  \n24B An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts related to hedged items separately by risk\ncategory for the types of hedges as follows:  \n(a) for fair value hedges:  \n(i) the carrying amount of the hedged item recognised in the statement of financial position\n(presenting assets separately from liabilities);  \n(ii) the accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments on the hedged item included in\nthe carrying amount of the hedged item recognised in the statement of financial position\n(presenting assets separately from liabilities);  \n(iii) the line item in the statement of financial position that includes the hedged item;  \n(iv) the change in value of the hedged item used as the basis for recognising hedge\nineffectiveness for the period; and  \n(v) the accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining in the statement of\nfinancial position for any hedged items that have ceased to be adjusted for hedging gains\nand losses in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10 of AASB 9.  \n(b) for cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation:  \n(i) the change in value of the hedged item used as the basis for recognising hedge\nineffectiveness for the period (ie for cash flow hedges the change in value used to\ndetermine the recognised hedge ineffectiveness in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11(c)\nof AASB 9);  \n(ii) the balances in the cash flow hedge reserve and the foreign currency translation reserve\nfor continuing hedges that are accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 6.5.11 and\n6.5.13(a) of AASB 9; and  \n(iii) the balances remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve and the foreign currency\ntranslation reserve from any hedging relationships for which hedge accounting is no\nlonger applied.  \n-----  24C An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts separately by risk category for the types\nof hedges as follows:  \n(a) for fair value hedges:  \n(i) hedge ineffectiveness\u2014ie the difference between the hedging gains or losses of the\nhedging instrument and the hedged item\u2014recognised in profit or loss (or other\ncomprehensive income for hedges of an equity instrument for which an entity has elected\nto present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income in accordance with\nparagraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9); and  \n(ii) the line item in the statement of comprehensive income that includes the recognised\nhedge ineffectiveness.  \n(b) for cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation:  \n(i) hedging gains or losses of the reporting period that were recognised in other\ncomprehensive income;  \n(ii) hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss;  \n(iii) the line item in the statement of comprehensive income that includes the recognised\nhedge ineffectiveness;  \n(iv) the amount reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve or the foreign currency\ntranslation reserve into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see AASB 101)\n(differentiating between amounts for which hedge accounting had previously been used,\nbut for which the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, and amounts\nthat have been transferred because the hedged item has affected profit or loss);  \n(v) the line item in the statement of comprehensive income that includes the reclassification\nadjustment (see AASB 101); and  \n(vi) for hedges of net positions, the hedging gains or losses recognised in a separate line item\nin the statement of comprehensive income (see paragraph 6.6.4 of AASB 9).  \n24D When the volume of hedging relationships to which the exemption in paragraph 23C applies is\nunrepresentative of normal volumes during the period (ie the volume at the reporting date does not reflect the\nvolumes during the period) an entity shall disclose that fact and the reason it believes the volumes are\nunrepresentative.  \n24E An entity shall provide a reconciliation of each component of equity and an analysis of other comprehensive\nincome in accordance with AASB 101 that, taken together:  \n(a) differentiates, at a minimum, between the amounts that relate to the disclosures in paragraph\n24C(b)(i) and (b)(iv) as well as the amounts accounted for in accordance with paragraph\n6.5.11(d)(i) and (d)(iii) of AASB 9;  \n(b) differentiates between the amounts associated with the time value of options that hedge transaction\nrelated hedged items and the amounts associated with the time value of options that hedge timeperiod related hedged items when an entity accounts for the time value of an option in accordance\nwith paragraph 6.5.15 of AASB 9; and  \n(c) differentiates between the amounts associated with forward elements of forward contracts and the\nforeign currency basis spreads of financial instruments that hedge transaction related hedged items,\nand the amounts associated with forward elements of forward contracts and the foreign currency\nbasis spreads of financial instruments that hedge time-period related hedged items when an entity\naccounts for those amounts in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16 of AASB 9.  \n24F An entity shall disclose the information required in paragraph 24E separately by risk category. This\ndisaggregation by risk may be provided in the notes to the financial statements.  \n_Option to designate a credit exposure as measured at fair value through profit or_\n_loss_  \n24G If an entity designated a financial instrument, or a proportion of it, as measured at fair value through profit or\nloss because it uses a credit derivative to manage the credit risk of that financial instrument it shall disclose:  \n(a) for credit derivatives that have been used to manage the credit risk of financial instruments\ndesignated as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 6.7.1 of\nAASB 9, a reconciliation of each of the nominal amount and the fair value at the beginning and at\nthe end of the period;  \n-----  (b) the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss on designation of a financial instrument, or a proportion\nof it, as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 6.7.1 of AASB 9;\nand  \n(c) on discontinuation of measuring a financial instrument, or a proportion of it, at fair value through\nprofit or loss, that financial instrument\u2019s fair value that has become the new carrying amount in\naccordance with paragraph 6.7.4 of AASB 9 and the related nominal or principal amount (except\nfor providing comparative information in accordance with AASB 101, an entity does not need to\ncontinue this disclosure in subsequent periods).  \n_Uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform_  \n24H For hedging relationships to which an entity applies the exceptions set out in paragraphs 6.8.4\u20136.8.12 of\nAASB 9 or paragraphs 102D\u2013102N of AASB 139, an entity shall disclose:  \n(a) the significant interest rate benchmarks to which the entity\u2019s hedging relationships are exposed;  \n(b) the extent of the risk exposure the entity manages that is directly affected by the interest rate\nbenchmark reform;  \n(c) how the entity is managing the process to transition to alternative benchmark rates;  \n(d) a description of significant assumptions or judgements the entity made in applying these paragraphs\n(for example, assumptions or judgements about when the uncertainty arising from interest rate\nbenchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest\nrate benchmark-based cash flows); and  \n(e) the nominal amount of the hedging instruments in those hedging relationships.",

However:  \n(a) for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, paragraph 35J(a) applies to those trade\nreceivables, contract assets or lease receivables on which lifetime expected credit losses are\nrecognised in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of AASB 9, if those financial assets are modified\nwhile more than 30 days past due; and  \n(b) paragraph 35K(b) does not apply to lease receivables.  \n35B The credit risk disclosures made in accordance with paragraphs 35F\u201335N shall enable users of financial\nstatements to understand the effect of credit risk on the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.\nTo achieve this objective, credit risk disclosures shall provide:  \n(a) information about an entity\u2019s credit risk management practices and how they relate to the\nrecognition and measurement of expected credit losses, including the methods, assumptions and\ninformation used to measure expected credit losses;  \n(b) quantitative and qualitative information that allows users of financial statements to evaluate the\namounts in the financial statements arising from expected credit losses, including changes in the\namount of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes; and  \n(c) information about an entity\u2019s credit risk exposure (ie the credit risk inherent in an entity\u2019s financial\nassets and commitments to extend credit) including significant credit risk concentrations.  \n35C An entity need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere, provided that the information is\nincorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to other statements, such as a management\ncommentary or risk report that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the\nfinancial statements and at the same time. Without the information incorporated by cross-reference, the\nfinancial statements are incomplete.  \n35D To meet the objectives in paragraph 35B, an entity shall (except as otherwise specified) consider how much\ndetail to disclose, how much emphasis to place on different aspects of the disclosure requirements, the\nappropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation, and whether users of financial statements need additional\nexplanations to evaluate the quantitative information disclosed.  \n35E If the disclosures provided in accordance with paragraphs 35F\u201335N are insufficient to meet the objectives in\nparagraph 35B, an entity shall disclose additional information that is necessary to meet those objectives.  \n_The credit risk management practices_  \n35F An entity shall explain its credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and\nmeasurement of expected credit losses. To meet this objective an entity shall disclose information that enables\nusers of financial statements to understand and evaluate:  \n-----  (a) how an entity determined whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly\nsince initial recognition, including, if and how:  \n(i) financial instruments are considered to have low credit risk in accordance with paragraph\n5.5.10 of AASB 9, including the classes of financial instruments to which it applies; and  \n(ii) the presumption in paragraph 5.5.11 of AASB 9, that there have been significant\nincreases in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 30\ndays past due, has been rebutted;  \n(b) an entity\u2019s definitions of default, including the reasons for selecting those definitions;  \n(c) how the instruments were grouped if expected credit losses were measured on a collective basis;  \n(d) how an entity determined that financial assets are credit-impaired financial assets;  \n(e) an entity\u2019s write-off policy, including the indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of\nrecovery and information about the policy for financial assets that are written-off but are still\nsubject to enforcement activity; and  \n(f) how the requirements in paragraph 5.5.12 of AASB 9 for the modification of contractual cash flows\nof financial assets have been applied, including how an entity:  \n(i) determines whether the credit risk on a financial asset that has been modified while the\nloss allowance was measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, has\nimproved to the extent that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount\nequal to 12-month expected credit losses in accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of AASB 9;\nand  \n(ii) monitors the extent to which the loss allowance on financial assets meeting the criteria\nin (i) is subsequently remeasured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses in\naccordance with paragraph 5.5.3 of AASB 9.  \n35G An entity shall explain the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used to apply the requirements in\nSection 5.5 of AASB 9. For this purpose an entity shall disclose:  \n(a) the basis of inputs and assumptions and the estimation techniques used to:  \n(i) measure the 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses;  \n(ii) determine whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly\nsince initial recognition; and  \n(iii) determine whether a financial asset is a credit-impaired financial asset.  \n(b) how forward-looking information has been incorporated into the determination of expected credit\nlosses, including the use of macroeconomic information; and  \n(c) changes in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the reporting period\nand the reasons for those changes.  \n_Quantitative and qualitative information about amounts arising from expected credit_\n_losses_  \n35H To explain the changes in the loss allowance and the reasons for those changes, an entity shall provide, by\nclass of financial instrument, a reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the loss\nallowance, in a table, showing separately the changes during the period for:  \n(a) the loss allowance measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses;  \n(b) the loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for:  \n(i) financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition but that are not credit-impaired financial assets;  \n(ii) financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (but that are not purchased\nor originated credit-impaired); and  \n(iii) trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables for which the loss allowances are\nmeasured in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of AASB 9.  \n(c) financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired. In addition to the reconciliation,\nan entity shall disclose the total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition\non financial assets initially recognised during the reporting period.  \n-----  35I To enable users of financial statements to understand the changes in the loss allowance disclosed in\naccordance with paragraph 35H, an entity shall provide an explanation of how significant changes in the gross\ncarrying amount of financial instruments during the period contributed to changes in the loss allowance. The\ninformation shall be provided separately for financial instruments that represent the loss allowance as listed\nin paragraph 35H(a)\u2013(c) and shall include relevant qualitative and quantitative information. Examples of\nchanges in the gross carrying amount of financial instruments that contributed to the changes in the loss\nallowance may include:  \n(a) changes because of financial instruments originated or acquired during the reporting period;  \n(b) the modification of contractual cash flows on financial assets that do not result in a derecognition\nof those financial assets in accordance with AASB 9;  \n(c) changes because of financial instruments that were derecognised (including those that were writtenoff) during the reporting period; and  \n(d) changes arising from whether the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month or\nlifetime expected credit losses.  \n35J To enable users of financial statements to understand the nature and effect of modifications of contractual\ncash flows on financial assets that have not resulted in derecognition and the effect of such modifications on\nthe measurement of expected credit losses, an entity shall disclose:  \n(a) the amortised cost before the modification and the net modification gain or loss recognised for\nfinancial assets for which the contractual cash flows have been modified during the reporting period\nwhile they had a loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses;\nand  \n(b) the gross carrying amount at the end of the reporting period of financial assets that have been\nmodified since initial recognition at a time when the loss allowance was measured at an amount\nequal to lifetime expected credit losses and for which the loss allowance has changed during the\nreporting period to an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.  \n35K To enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements\non the amounts arising from expected credit losses, an entity shall disclose by class of financial instrument:  \n(a) the amount that best represents its maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting\nperiod without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements (eg netting\nagreements that do not qualify for offset in accordance with AASB 132).  \n(b) a narrative description of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements, including:  \n(i) a description of the nature and quality of the collateral held;  \n(ii) an explanation of any significant changes in the quality of that collateral or credit\nenhancements as a result of deterioration or changes in the collateral policies of the entity\nduring the reporting period; and  \n(iii) information about financial instruments for which an entity has not recognised a loss\nallowance because of the collateral.  \n(c) quantitative information about the collateral held as security and other credit enhancements (for\nexample, quantification of the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate\ncredit risk) for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date.  \n35L An entity shall disclose the contractual amount outstanding on financial assets that were written off during\nthe reporting period and are still subject to enforcement activity.  \n_Credit risk exposure_  \n35M To enable users of financial statements to assess an entity\u2019s credit risk exposure and understand its significant\ncredit risk concentrations, an entity shall disclose, by credit risk rating grades, the gross carrying amount of\nfinancial assets and the exposure to credit risk on loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. This\ninformation shall be provided separately for financial instruments:  \n(a) for which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses;  \n(b) for which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses and\nthat are:  \n(i) financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition but that are not credit-impaired financial assets;  \n-----  (ii) financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (but that are not purchased\nor originated credit-impaired); and  \n(iii) trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables for which the loss allowances are\nmeasured in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of AASB 9.  \n(c) that are purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets.  \n35N For trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables to which an entity applies paragraph 5.5.15 of\nAASB 9, the information provided in accordance with paragraph 35M may be based on a provision matrix\n(see paragraph B5.5.35 of AASB 9).  \n36 For all financial instruments within the scope of this Standard, but to which the impairment requirements in\nAASB 9 are not applied, an entity shall disclose by class of financial instrument:  \n(a) the amount that best represents its maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting\nperiod without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements (eg netting\nagreements that do not qualify for offset in accordance with AASB 132); this disclosure is not\nrequired for financial instruments whose carrying amount best represents the maximum exposure\nto credit risk.  \n(b) a description of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements, and their financial effect\n(eg quantification of the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate credit\nrisk) in respect of the amount that best represents the maximum exposure to credit risk (whether\ndisclosed in accordance with (a) or represented by the carrying amount of a financial instrument).  \n(c) [deleted]  \n(d) [deleted]  \n37 [Deleted]  \n_Collateral and other credit enhancements obtained_  \n38 When an entity obtains financial or non-financial assets during the period by taking possession of collateral\nit holds as security or calling on other credit enhancements (eg guarantees), and such assets meet the\nrecognition criteria in other Australian Accounting Standards, an entity shall disclose for such assets held at\nthe reporting date:  \n(a) the nature and carrying amount of the assets; and  \n(b) when the assets are not readily convertible into cash, its policies for disposing of such assets or for\nusing them in its operations.",

Therefore this paragraph may\nresult in disclosure on more than one date of initial application.  \n42K In the reporting period that an entity first applies the classification and measurement requirements for\nfinancial assets in AASB 9 (ie when the entity transitions from AASB 139 to AASB 9 for financial assets), it\nshall present the disclosures set out in paragraphs 42L\u201342O of this Standard as required by paragraph 7.2.15\nof AASB 9.  \n42L When required by paragraph 42K, an entity shall disclose the changes in the classifications of financial assets\nand financial liabilities as at the date of initial application of AASB 9, showing separately:  \n(a) the changes in the carrying amounts on the basis of their measurement categories in accordance\nwith AASB 139 (ie not resulting from a change in measurement attribute on transition to AASB 9);\nand  \n(b) the changes in the carrying amounts arising from a change in measurement attribute on transition\nto AASB 9.  \nThe disclosures in this paragraph need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity\ninitially applies the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets in AASB 9.  \n42M When required by paragraph 42K, an entity shall disclose the following for financial assets and financial\nliabilities that have been reclassified so that they are measured at amortised cost and, in the case of financial\nassets, that have been reclassified out of fair value through profit or loss so that they are measured at fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income, as a result of the transition to AASB 9:  \n(a) the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period; and  \n(b) the fair value gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive\nincome during the reporting period if the financial assets or financial liabilities had not been\nreclassified.  \nThe disclosures in this paragraph need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity\ninitially applies the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets in AASB 9.  \n-----  42N When required by paragraph 42K, an entity shall disclose the following for financial assets and financial\nliabilities that have been reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category as a result of the\ntransition to AASB 9:  \n(a) the effective interest rate determined on the date of initial application; and  \n(b) the interest revenue or expense recognised.  \nIf an entity treats the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability as the new gross carrying amount at\nthe date of initial application (see paragraph 7.2.11 of AASB 9), the disclosures in this paragraph shall be\nmade for each reporting period until derecognition. Otherwise, the disclosures in this paragraph need not be\nmade after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and measurement\nrequirements for financial assets in AASB 9.  \n42O When an entity presents the disclosures set out in paragraphs 42K\u201342N, those disclosures, and the disclosures\nin paragraph 25 of this Standard, must permit reconciliation between:  \n(a) the measurement categories presented in accordance with AASB 139 and AASB 9; and  \n(b) the class of financial instrument  \nas at the date of initial application.  \n42P On the date of initial application of Section 5.5 of AASB 9, an entity is required to disclose information that\nwould permit the reconciliation of the ending impairment allowances in accordance with AASB 139 and the\nprovisions in accordance with AASB 137 to the opening loss allowances determined in accordance with\nAASB 9. For financial assets, this disclosure shall be provided by the related financial assets\u2019 measurement\ncategories in accordance with AASB 139 and AASB 9, and shall show separately the effect of the changes in\nthe measurement category on the loss allowance at that date.  \n42Q In the reporting period that includes the date of initial application of AASB 9, an entity is not required to\ndisclose the line item amounts that would have been reported in accordance with the classification and\nmeasurement requirements (which includes the requirements related to amortised cost measurement of\nfinancial assets and impairment in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of AASB 9) of:  \n(a) AASB 9 for prior periods; and  \n(b) AASB 139 for the current period.  \n42R In accordance with paragraph 7.2.4 of AASB 9, if it is impracticable (as defined in AASB 108) at the date of\ninitial application of AASB 9 for an entity to assess a modified time value of money element in accordance\nwith paragraphs B4.1.9B\u2013B4.1.9D of AASB 9 based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial\nrecognition of the financial asset, an entity shall assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of that\nfinancial asset based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset\nwithout taking into account the requirements related to the modification of the time value of money element\nin paragraphs B4.1.9B\u2013B4.1.9D of AASB 9.

An entity\u2019s assumptions and\ninputs used to measure expected credit losses or determine the extent of increases in credit risk since initial\nrecognition may include information obtained from internal historical information or rating reports and\nassumptions about the expected life of financial instruments and the timing of the sale of collateral.  \n-----  ",

An entity shall\nexplain how those data are determined. If the outflows of cash (or another financial asset) included in those\ndata could either:  \n(a) occur significantly earlier than indicated in the data, or  \n(b) be for significantly different amounts from those indicated in the data (eg for a derivative that is\nincluded in the data on a net settlement basis but for which the counterparty has the option to require\ngross settlement),  \nthe entity shall state that fact and provide quantitative information that enables users of its financial statements\nto evaluate the extent of this risk unless that information is included in the contractual maturity analyses\nrequired by paragraph 39(a) or (b).  \nB11 In preparing the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b), an entity uses its judgement to\ndetermine an appropriate number of time bands. For example, an entity might determine that the following\ntime bands are appropriate:  \n(a) not later than one month;  \n(b) later than one month and not later than three months;  \n(c) later than three months and not later than one year; and  \n(d) later than one year and not later than five years.  \nB11A In complying with paragraph 39(a) and (b), an entity shall not separate an embedded derivative from a hybrid\n(combined) financial instrument. For such an instrument, an entity shall apply paragraph 39(a).  \nB11B Paragraph 39(b) requires an entity to disclose a quantitative maturity analysis for derivative financial\nliabilities that shows remaining contractual maturities if the contractual maturities are essential for an\nunderstanding of the timing of the cash flows. For example, this would be the case for:  \n-----  (a) an interest rate swap with a remaining maturity of five years in a cash flow hedge of a variable rate\nfinancial asset or liability.  \n(b) all loan commitments.  \nB11C Paragraph 39(a) and (b) requires an entity to disclose maturity analyses for financial liabilities that show the\nremaining contractual maturities for some financial liabilities. In this disclosure:  \n(a) when a counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest\nperiod in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, financial liabilities that an entity\ncan be required to repay on demand (eg demand deposits) are included in the earliest time band.  \n(b) when an entity is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated\nto the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, an undrawn loan\ncommitment is included in the time band containing the earliest date it can be drawn down.  \n(c) for issued financial guarantee contracts the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the\nearliest period in which the guarantee could be called.  \nB11D The contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity analyses as required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) are the\ncontractual undiscounted cash flows, for example:  \n(a) gross lease liabilities (before deducting finance charges);  \n(b) prices specified in forward agreements to purchase financial assets for cash;  \n(c) net amounts for pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps for which net cash flows are\nexchanged;  \n(d) contractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative financial instrument (eg a currency swap) for\nwhich gross cash flows are exchanged; and  \n(e) gross loan commitments.  \nSuch undiscounted cash flows differ from the amount included in the statement of financial position because\nthe amount in that statement is based on discounted cash flows. When the amount payable is not fixed, the\namount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. For\nexample, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on\nthe level of the index at the end of the period.  \nB11E Paragraph 39(c) requires an entity to describe how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in the items disclosed\nin the quantitative disclosures required in paragraph 39(a) and (b). An entity shall disclose a maturity analysis\nof financial assets it holds for managing liquidity risk (eg financial assets that are readily saleable or expected\nto generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities), if that information is necessary to\nenable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.  \nB11F Other factors that an entity might consider in providing the disclosure required in paragraph 39(c) include,\nbut are not limited to, whether the entity:  \n(a) has committed borrowing facilities (eg commercial paper facilities) or other lines of credit (eg\nstand-by credit facilities) that it can access to meet liquidity needs;  \n(b) holds deposits at central banks to meet liquidity needs;  \n(c) has very diverse funding sources;  \n(d) has significant concentrations of liquidity risk in either its assets or its funding sources;  \n(e) has internal control processes and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk;  \n(f) has instruments that include accelerated repayment terms (eg on the downgrade of the entity\u2019s credit\nrating);  \n(g) has instruments that could require the posting of collateral (eg margin calls for derivatives);  \n(h) has instruments that allow the entity to choose whether it settles its financial liabilities by delivering\ncash (or another financial asset) or by delivering its own shares;  \n(i) has instruments that are subject to master netting agreements; or  \n(j) has accessed, or has access to, facilities under supplier finance arrangements (as described in\nparagraph 44G of AASB 7) that provide the entity with extended payment terms or the entity\u2019s\nsuppliers with early payment terms.  \nB12\u2013\nB16 [Deleted]  \n-----  ",

In\naccordance with paragraph B3, an entity decides how it aggregates information to display the overall picture\nwithout combining information with different characteristics about exposures to risks from significantly\ndifferent economic environments. For example:  \n(a) an entity that trades financial instruments might disclose this information separately for financial\ninstruments held for trading and those not held for trading.  \n(b) an entity would not aggregate its exposure to market risks from areas of hyperinflation with its\nexposure to the same market risks from areas of very low inflation.  \nIf an entity has exposure to only one type of market risk in only one economic environment, it would not\nshow disaggregated information.  \nB18 Paragraph 40(a) requires the sensitivity analysis to show the effect on profit or loss and equity of reasonably\npossible changes in the relevant risk variable (eg prevailing market interest rates, currency rates, equity prices\nor commodity prices). For this purpose:  \n(a) entities are not required to determine what the profit or loss for the period would have been if\nrelevant risk variables had been different. Instead, entities disclose the effect on profit or loss and\nequity at the end of the reporting period assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant\nrisk variable had occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the risk\nexposures in existence at that date. For example, if an entity has a floating rate liability at the end\nof the year, the entity would disclose the effect on profit or loss (ie interest expense) for the current\nyear if interest rates had varied by reasonably possible amounts.  \n(b) entities are not required to disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity for each change within a\nrange of reasonably possible changes of the relevant risk variable. Disclosure of the effects of the\nchanges at the limits of the reasonably possible range would be sufficient.  \nB19 In determining what a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable is, an entity should consider:  \n(a) the economic environments in which it operates. A reasonably possible change should not include\nremote or \u2018worst case\u2019 scenarios or \u2018stress tests\u2019. Moreover, if the rate of change in the underlying\nrisk variable is stable, the entity need not alter the chosen reasonably possible change in the risk\nvariable. For example, assume that interest rates are 5 per cent and an entity determines that a\nfluctuation in interest rates of \u00b150 basis points is reasonably possible. It would disclose the effect\non profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 4.5 per cent or 5.5 per cent. In the\nnext period, interest rates have increased to 5.5 per cent. The entity continues to believe that interest\nrates may fluctuate by \u00b150 basis points (ie that the rate of change in interest rates is stable). The\nentity would disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 5 per\ncent or 6 per cent. The entity would not be required to revise its assessment that interest rates might\nreasonably fluctuate by \u00b150 basis points, unless there is evidence that interest rates have become\nsignificantly more volatile.  \n(b) the time frame over which it is making the assessment. The sensitivity analysis shall show the\neffects of changes that are considered to be reasonably possible over the period until the entity will\nnext present these disclosures, which is usually its next annual reporting period.  \nB20 Paragraph 41 permits an entity to use a sensitivity analysis that reflects interdependencies between risk\nvariables, such as a value-at-risk methodology, if it uses this analysis to manage its exposure to financial risks.\nThis applies even if such a methodology measures only the potential for loss and does not measure the\npotential for gain. Such an entity might comply with paragraph 41(a) by disclosing the type of value-at-risk\nmodel used (eg whether the model relies on Monte Carlo simulations), an explanation about how the model\nworks and the main assumptions (eg the holding period and confidence level). Entities might also disclose\nthe historical observation period and weightings applied to observations within that period, an explanation of\nhow options are dealt with in the calculations, and which volatilities and correlations (or, alternatively, Monte\nCarlo probability distribution simulations) are used.  \nB21 An entity shall provide sensitivity analyses for the whole of its business, but may provide different types of\nsensitivity analysis for different classes of financial instruments.",

For example, if a subsidiary\ntransfers to an unrelated third party a financial asset in which the parent of the subsidiary has continuing\ninvolvement, the subsidiary does not include the parent\u2019s involvement in the assessment of whether it has\ncontinuing involvement in the transferred asset in its separate or individual financial statements (ie when the\nsubsidiary is the reporting entity). However, a parent would include its continuing involvement (or that of\nanother member of the group) in a financial asset transferred by its subsidiary in determining whether it has\ncontinuing involvement in the transferred asset in its consolidated financial statements (ie when the reporting\nentity is the group).  \nB30 An entity does not have a continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, it\nneither retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset nor\nacquires any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset. An entity does\nnot have continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if it has neither an interest in the future\nperformance of the transferred financial asset nor a responsibility under any circumstances to make payments\nin respect of the transferred financial asset in the future.

The entity assesses the servicing contract in\naccordance with the guidance in paragraphs 42C and B30 to decide whether the entity has continuing\ninvolvement as a result of the servicing contract for the purposes of the disclosure requirements. For example,\na servicer will have continuing involvement in the transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure\nrequirements if the servicing fee is dependent on the amount or timing of the cash flows collected from the\ntransferred financial asset. Similarly, a servicer has continuing involvement for the purposes of the disclosure\nrequirements if a fixed fee would not be paid in full because of non-performance of the transferred financial\nasset. In these examples, the servicer has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial\nasset. This assessment is independent of whether the fee to be received is expected to compensate the entity\nadequately for performing the servicing.  \n-----  B31 Continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset may result from contractual provisions in the transfer\nagreement or in a separate agreement with the transferee or a third party entered into in connection with the\ntransfer.",

For example, an entity might determine that the following maturity\ntime bands are appropriate:  \n(a) not later than one month;  \n(b) later than one month and not later than three months;  \n(c) later than three months and not later than six months;  \n(d) later than six months and not later than one year;  \n(e) later than one year and not later than three years;  \n(f) later than three years and not later than five years; and  \n(g) more than five years.  \nB36 If there is a range of possible maturities, the cash flows are included on the basis of the earliest date on which\nthe entity can be required or is permitted to pay.",

In addition, financial instruments are within the scope of the\ndisclosure requirements in paragraphs 13B\u201313E if they are subject to an enforceable master netting\narrangement or similar agreement that covers similar financial instruments and transactions, irrespective of\nwhether the financial instruments are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of AASB 132.  \nB41 The similar agreements referred to in paragraphs 13A and B40 include derivative clearing agreements, global\nmaster repurchase agreements, global master securities lending agreements, and any related rights to financial\ncollateral. The similar financial instruments and transactions referred to in paragraph B40 include derivatives,\nsale and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, and securities\nlending agreements. Examples of financial instruments that are not within the scope of paragraph 13A are\nloans and customer deposits at the same institution (unless they are set off in the statement of financial\nposition), and financial instruments that are subject only to a collateral agreement.  \n**Disclosure of quantitative information for recognised financial assets and**\n**recognised financial liabilities within the scope of paragraph 13A**\n**(paragraph 13C)**  \nB42 Financial instruments disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C may be subject to different measurement\nrequirements (for example, a payable related to a repurchase agreement may be measured at amortised cost,\nwhile a derivative will be measured at fair value). An entity shall include instruments at their recognised\namounts and describe any resulting measurement differences in the related disclosures.  \n**Disclosure of the gross amounts of recognised financial assets and**\n**recognised financial liabilities within the scope of paragraph 13A**\n**(paragraph 13C(a))**  \nB43 The amounts required by paragraph 13C(a) relate to recognised financial instruments that are set off in\naccordance with paragraph 42 of AASB 132. The amounts required by paragraph 13C(a) also relate to\nrecognised financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar\nagreement irrespective of whether they meet the offsetting criteria. However, the disclosures required by\nparagraph 13C(a) do not relate to any amounts recognised as a result of collateral agreements that do not meet\nthe offsetting criteria in paragraph 42 of AASB 132. Instead, such amounts are required to be disclosed in\naccordance with paragraph 13C(d).  \n-----  **Disclosure of the amounts that are set off in accordance with the criteria in**\n**paragraph 42 of AASB 132 (paragraph 13C(b))**  \nB44 Paragraph 13C(b) requires that entities disclose the amounts set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of\nAASB 132 when determining the net amounts presented in the statement of financial position. The amounts\nof both the recognised financial assets and the recognised financial liabilities that are subject to set-off under\nthe same arrangement will be disclosed in both the financial asset and financial liability disclosures. However,\nthe amounts disclosed (in, for example, a table) are limited to the amounts that are subject to set-off. For\nexample, an entity may have a recognised derivative asset and a recognised derivative liability that meet the\noffsetting criteria in paragraph 42 of AASB 132. If the gross amount of the derivative asset is larger than the\ngross amount of the derivative liability, the financial asset disclosure table will include the entire amount of\nthe derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)) and the entire amount of the derivative liability\n(in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)). However, while the financial liability disclosure table will include\nthe entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)), it will only include the\namount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)) that is equal to the amount of the\nderivative liability.  \n**Disclosure of the net amounts presented in the statement of financial position**\n**(paragraph 13C(c))**  \nB45 If an entity has instruments that meet the scope of these disclosures (as specified in paragraph 13A), but that\ndo not meet the offsetting criteria in paragraph 42 of AASB 132, the amounts required to be disclosed by\nparagraph 13C(c) would equal the amounts required to be disclosed by paragraph 13C(a).  \nB46 The amounts required to be disclosed by paragraph 13C(c) must be reconciled to the individual line item\namounts presented in the statement of financial position. For example, if an entity determines that the\naggregation or disaggregation of individual financial statement line item amounts provides more relevant\ninformation, it must reconcile the aggregated or disaggregated amounts disclosed in paragraph 13C(c) back\nto the individual line item amounts presented in the statement of financial position.  \n**Disclosure of the amounts subject to an enforceable master netting**\n**arrangement or similar agreement that are not otherwise included in**\n**paragraph 13C(b) (paragraph 13C(d))**  \nB47 Paragraph 13C(d) requires that entities disclose amounts that are subject to an enforceable master netting\narrangement or similar agreement that are not otherwise included in paragraph 13C(b). Paragraph 13C(d)(i)\nrefers to amounts related to recognised financial instruments that do not meet some or all of the offsetting\ncriteria in paragraph 42 of AASB 132 (for example, current rights of set-off that do not meet the criterion in\nparagraph 42(b) of AASB 132, or conditional rights of set-off that are enforceable and exercisable only in the\nevent of default, or only in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of any of the counterparties).  \nB48 Paragraph 13C(d)(ii) refers to amounts related to financial collateral, including cash collateral, both received\nand pledged. An entity shall disclose the fair value of those financial instruments that have been pledged or\nreceived as collateral. The amounts disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d)(ii) should relate to the\nactual collateral received or pledged and not to any resulting payables or receivables recognised to return or\nreceive back such collateral.  \n**Limits on the amounts disclosed in paragraph 13C(d)**\n**(paragraph 13D)**  \nB49 When disclosing amounts in accordance with paragraph 13C(d), an entity must take into account the effects\nof over-collateralisation by financial instrument. To do so, the entity must first deduct the amounts disclosed\nin accordance with paragraph 13C(d)(i) from the amount disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(c). The\nentity shall then limit the amounts disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d)(ii) to the remaining amount\nin paragraph 13C(c) for the related financial instrument. However, if rights to collateral can be enforced across\nfinancial instruments, such rights can be included in the disclosure provided in accordance with paragraph\n13D.  \n**Description of the rights of set-off subject to enforceable master netting**\n**arrangements and similar agreements (paragraph 13E)**  \nB50 An entity shall describe the types of rights of set-off and similar arrangements disclosed in accordance with\nparagraph 13C(d), including the nature of those rights. For example, an entity shall describe its conditional  \n-----  rights. For instruments subject to rights of set-off that are not contingent on a future event but that do not meet\nthe remaining criteria in paragraph 42 of AASB 132, the entity shall describe the reason(s) why the criteria\nare not met. For any financial collateral received or pledged, the entity shall describe the terms of the collateral\nagreement (for example, when the collateral is restricted).",
