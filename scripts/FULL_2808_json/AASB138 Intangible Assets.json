For example, this Standard does not apply to:  \n(a) intangible assets held by an entity for sale in the ordinary course of business (see AASB 102\n_Inventories)._  \n(b) deferred tax assets (see AASB 112 Income Taxes).  \n(c) leases of intangible assets accounted for in accordance with AASB 16 Leases.  \n(d) assets arising from employee benefits (see AASB 119 Employee Benefits).  \n(e) financial assets as defined in AASB 132. The recognition and measurement of some financial\nassets are covered by AASB 10 _Consolidated Financial Statements, AASB 127_ _Separate_\n_Financial Statements and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures._  \n(f) goodwill acquired in a business combination (see AASB 3 Business Combinations).  \n(g) contracts within the scope of AASB 17 _Insurance Contracts_ and any assets for insurance\nacquisition cash flows as defined in AASB 17.  \n(h) non-current intangible assets classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is\nclassified as held for sale) in accordance with AASB 5 _Non-current Assets Held for Sale and_\n_Discontinued Operations._  \n(i) assets arising from contracts with customers that are recognised in accordance with AASB 15\n_Revenue from Contracts with Customers._  \nAus3.1 This Standard does not apply to intangible assets recognised as service concession assets in\naccordance with AASB 1059 _Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors, except as set out in_\nthat Standard.  \n-----  Aus3.2 Further to paragraph 3, public sector entities shall not apply this Standard to deferred acquisition\ncosts, and intangible assets, arising from an insurer\u2019s contractual rights under insurance contracts\nwithin the scope of AASB 4 _Insurance Contracts. AASB 4 sets out specific disclosure_\nrequirements for those deferred acquisition costs but not for those intangible assets. Therefore,\nthe disclosure requirements in this Standard apply to those intangible assets.  \n4 Some intangible assets may be contained in or on a physical substance such as a compact disc (in the case\nof computer software), legal documentation (in the case of a licence or patent) or film. In determining\nwhether an asset that incorporates both intangible and tangible elements should be treated under AASB 116\n_Property, Plant and Equipment or as an intangible asset under this Standard, an entity uses judgement to_\nassess which element is more significant. For example, computer software for a computer-controlled\nmachine tool that cannot operate without that specific software is an integral part of the related hardware\nand it is treated as property, plant and equipment. The same applies to the operating system of a computer.\nWhen the software is not an integral part of the related hardware, computer software is treated as an\nintangible asset.  \n5 This Standard applies to, among other things, expenditure on advertising, training, start-up, research and\ndevelopment activities. Research and development activities are directed to the development of knowledge.\nTherefore, although these activities may result in an asset with physical substance (eg a prototype), the\nphysical element of the asset is secondary to its intangible component, ie the knowledge embodied in it.  \n6 Rights held by a lessee under licensing agreements for items such as motion picture films, video recordings,\nplays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights are within the scope of this Standard and are excluded from the\nscope of AASB 16.  \n7 Exclusions from the scope of a Standard may occur if activities or transactions are so specialised that they\ngive rise to accounting issues that may need to be dealt with in a different way. Such issues arise in the\naccounting for expenditure on the exploration for, or development and extraction of, oil, gas and mineral\ndeposits in extractive industries and in the case of insurance contracts. Therefore, this Standard does not\napply to expenditure on such activities and contracts. However, this Standard applies to other intangible\nassets used (such as computer software), and other expenditure incurred (such as start-up costs), in\nextractive industries or by insurers.",

The capacity of an entity to\ncontrol the future economic benefits from an intangible asset would normally stem from legal rights that are\nenforceable in a court of law. In the absence of legal rights, it is more difficult to demonstrate control.\nHowever, legal enforceability of a right is not a necessary condition for control because an entity may be\nable to control the future economic benefits in some other way.  \n14 Market and technical knowledge may give rise to future economic benefits. An entity controls those\nbenefits if, for example, the knowledge is protected by legal rights such as copyrights, a restraint of trade\nagreement (where permitted) or by a legal duty on employees to maintain confidentiality.  \n-----  15 An entity may have a team of skilled staff and may be able to identify incremental staff skills leading to\nfuture economic benefits from training. The entity may also expect that the staff will continue to make their\nskills available to the entity. However, an entity usually has insufficient control over the expected future\neconomic benefits arising from a team of skilled staff and from training for these items to meet the\ndefinition of an intangible asset. For a similar reason, specific management or technical talent is unlikely to\nmeet the definition of an intangible asset, unless it is protected by legal rights to use it and to obtain the\nfuture economic benefits expected from it, and it also meets the other parts of the definition.  \n16 An entity may have a portfolio of customers or a market share and expect that, because of its efforts in\nbuilding customer relationships and loyalty, the customers will continue to trade with the entity. However,\nin the absence of legal rights to protect, or other ways to control, the relationships with customers or the\nloyalty of the customers to the entity, the entity usually has insufficient control over the expected economic\nbenefits from customer relationships and loyalty for such items (eg portfolio of customers, market shares,\ncustomer relationships and customer loyalty) to meet the definition of intangible assets. In the absence of\nlegal rights to protect customer relationships, exchange transactions for the same or similar non-contractual\ncustomer relationships (other than as part of a business combination) provide evidence that the entity is\nnonetheless able to control the expected future economic benefits flowing from the customer relationships.\nBecause such exchange transactions also provide evidence that the customer relationships are separable,\nthose customer relationships meet the definition of an intangible asset.",

Paragraph 44 deals with the initial measurement of intangible assets acquired by way of a\ngovernment grant, paragraphs 45\u201347 with exchanges of intangible assets, and paragraphs 48\u201350 with the\ntreatment of internally generated goodwill. Paragraphs 51\u201367 deal with the initial recognition and\nmeasurement of internally generated intangible assets.  \n20 The nature of intangible assets is such that, in many cases, there are no additions to such an asset or\nreplacements of part of it. Accordingly, most subsequent expenditures are likely to maintain the expected\nfuture economic benefits embodied in an existing intangible asset rather than meet the definition of an\nintangible asset and the recognition criteria in this Standard. In addition, it is often difficult to attribute\nsubsequent expenditure directly to a particular intangible asset rather than to the business as a whole.\nTherefore, only rarely will subsequent expenditure\u2014expenditure incurred after the initial recognition of an\nacquired intangible asset or after completion of an internally generated intangible asset\u2014be recognised in\nthe carrying amount of an asset. Consistently with paragraph 63, subsequent expenditure on brands,\nmastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance (whether externally acquired or\ninternally generated) is always recognised in profit or loss as incurred. This is because such expenditure\ncannot be distinguished from expenditure to develop the business as a whole.  \n**21** **An intangible asset shall be recognised if, and only if:**  \n**(a)** **it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset**\n**will flow to the entity; and**  \n**(b)** **the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.**  \n**22** **An entity shall assess the probability of expected future economic benefits using reasonable and**\n**supportable assumptions that represent management\u2019s best estimate of the set of economic conditions**\n**that will exist over the useful life of the asset.**  \n-----  23 An entity uses judgement to assess the degree of certainty attached to the flow of future economic benefits\nthat are attributable to the use of the asset on the basis of the evidence available at the time of initial\nrecognition, giving greater weight to external evidence.  \n**24** **An intangible asset shall be measured initially at cost.**  \n**Aus24.1** **Notwithstanding paragraph 24, not-for-profit entities shall initially measure the cost of the**\n**asset at** **_fair value where the consideration for the asset is significantly less than fair value_**\n**principally to enable the entity to further its objectives.

In\nother words, the entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits, even if there is uncertainty about\nthe timing or the amount of the inflow. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in paragraph 21(a) is\nalways considered to be satisfied for separately acquired intangible assets.  \n26 In addition, the cost of a separately acquired intangible asset can usually be measured reliably. This is\nparticularly so when the purchase consideration is in the form of cash or other monetary assets.  \n27 The cost of a separately acquired intangible asset comprises:  \n(a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting\ntrade discounts and rebates; and  \n(b) any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use.  \n28 Examples of directly attributable costs are:  \n(a) costs of employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119) arising directly from bringing the asset to\nits working condition;  \n(b) professional fees arising directly from bringing the asset to its working condition; and  \n(c) costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly.  \n29 Examples of expenditures that are not part of the cost of an intangible asset are:  \n(a) costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional\nactivities);  \n(b) costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including costs of\nstaff training); and  \n(c) administration and other general overhead costs.  \n30 Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an intangible asset ceases when the asset is in the condition\nnecessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Therefore, costs incurred\nin using or redeploying an intangible asset are not included in the carrying amount of that asset. For\nexample, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an intangible asset:  \n(a) costs incurred while an asset capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet\nto be brought into use; and  \n(b) initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the asset\u2019s output builds up.  \n31 Some operations occur in connection with the development of an intangible asset, but are not necessary to\nbring the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by\nmanagement. These incidental operations may occur before or during the development activities. Because\nincidental operations are not necessary to bring an asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of\noperating in the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of incidental operations\nare recognised immediately in profit or loss, and included in their respective classifications of income and\nexpense.  \n32 If payment for an intangible asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is the cash price\nequivalent. The difference between this amount and the total payments is recognised as interest expense\nover the period of credit unless it is capitalised in accordance with AASB 123 Borrowing Costs.  \n-----  ",

The following discussion refers simply to an exchange\nof one non-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding\nsentence. The cost of such an intangible asset is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction\nlacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is\nreliably measurable. The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately\nderecognise the asset given up. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the\ncarrying amount of the asset given up.  \n46 An entity determines whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance by considering the extent\nto which its future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An exchange transaction\nhas commercial substance if:  \n(a) the configuration (ie risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from\nthe configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred; or  \n(b) the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity\u2019s operations affected by the transaction\nchanges as a result of the exchange; and  \n(c) the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged.  \nFor the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entityspecific value of the portion of the entity\u2019s operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash\nflows.

The fair value of an intangible asset is reliably measurable if (a) the\nvariability in the range of reasonable fair value measurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the\nprobabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring\nfair value. If an entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given\nup, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure cost unless the fair value of the asset received\nis more clearly evident.",

For the purpose of revaluations under this Standard, fair value shall**\n**be measured by reference to an active market. Revaluations shall be made with such regularity that**\n**at the end of the reporting period the carrying amount of the asset does not differ materially from its**\n**fair value.**  \n76 The revaluation model does not allow:  \n(a) the revaluation of intangible assets that have not previously been recognised as assets; or  \n(b) the initial recognition of intangible assets at amounts other than cost.  \n77 The revaluation model is applied after an asset has been initially recognised at cost. However, if only part of\nthe cost of an intangible asset is recognised as an asset because the asset did not meet the criteria for\nrecognition until part of the way through the process (see paragraph 65), the revaluation model may be\napplied to the whole of that asset. Also, the revaluation model may be applied to an intangible asset that was\nreceived by way of a government grant and recognised at a nominal amount (see paragraph 44).  \n78 It is uncommon for an active market to exist for an intangible asset, although this may happen. For example,\nin some jurisdictions, an active market may exist for freely transferable taxi licences, fishing licences or\nproduction quotas. However, an active market cannot exist for brands, newspaper mastheads, music and\nfilm publishing rights, patents or trademarks, because each such asset is unique. Also, although intangible\nassets are bought and sold, contracts are negotiated between individual buyers and sellers, and transactions\nare relatively infrequent. For these reasons, the price paid for one asset may not provide sufficient evidence\nof the fair value of another. Moreover, prices are often not available to the public.  \n79 The frequency of revaluations depends on the volatility of the fair values of the intangible assets being\nrevalued. If the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further\nrevaluation is necessary. Some intangible assets may experience significant and volatile movements in fair\nvalue, thus necessitating annual revaluation. Such frequent revaluations are unnecessary for intangible\nassets with only insignificant movements in fair value.  \n80 When an intangible asset is revalued, the carrying amount of that asset is adjusted to the revalued amount.\nAt the date of the revaluation, the asset is treated in one of the following ways:  \n(a) the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the\ncarrying amount of the asset. For example, the gross carrying amount may be restated by\nreference to observable market data or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the\ncarrying amount. The accumulated amortisation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal\nthe difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after\ntaking into account accumulated impairment losses; or  \n-----  (b) the accumulated amortisation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.  \nThe amount of the adjustment of accumulated amortisation forms part of the increase or decrease in the\ncarrying amount that is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 85 and 86.  \n**81** **If an intangible asset in a class of revalued intangible assets cannot be revalued because there is no**\n**active market for this asset, the asset shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated amortisation**\n**and impairment losses.**  \n**82** **If the fair value of a revalued intangible asset can no longer be measured by reference to an active**\n**market, the carrying amount of the asset shall be its revalued amount at the date of the last**\n**revaluation by reference to the active market less any subsequent accumulated amortisation and any**\n**subsequent accumulated impairment losses.**  \n83 The fact that an active market no longer exists for a revalued intangible asset may indicate that the asset\nmay be impaired and that it needs to be tested in accordance with AASB 136.  \n84 If the fair value of the asset can be measured by reference to an active market at a subsequent measurement\ndate, the revaluation model is applied from that date.  \n**85** **If an intangible asset\u2019s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be**\n**recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of**\n**revaluation surplus. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it**\n**reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.**  \n**Aus85.1** **Notwithstanding paragraph 85, in respect of not-for-profit entities, if the carrying amount**\n**of a class of assets is increased as a result of a revaluation, the net revaluation increase shall**\n**be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading**\n**of revaluation surplus.

However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income**\n**to the extent of any credit balance in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. The decrease**\n**recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in equity under the**\n**heading of revaluation surplus.**  \n**Aus86.1** **Notwithstanding paragraph 86, in respect of not-for-profit entities, if the carrying amount**\n**of a class of assets decreased as a result of a revaluation, the net revaluation decrease shall**\n**be recognised in profit or loss.

The whole surplus may be realised on the retirement or disposal of the asset.\nHowever, some of the surplus may be realised as the asset is used by the entity; in such a case, the amount\nof the surplus realised is the difference between amortisation based on the revalued carrying amount of the\nasset and amortisation that would have been recognised based on the asset\u2019s historical cost. The transfer\nfrom revaluation surplus to retained earnings is not made through profit or loss.",

An intangible**\n**asset shall be regarded by the entity as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of**\n**all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to**\n**generate net cash inflows for the entity.**  \n89 The accounting for an intangible asset is based on its useful life. An intangible asset with a finite useful life\nis amortised (see paragraphs 97\u2013106), and an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not (see\nparagraphs 107\u2013110). The Illustrative Examples accompanying this Standard illustrate the determination of  \n-----  useful life for different intangible assets, and the subsequent accounting for those assets based on the useful\nlife determinations.  \n90 Many factors are considered in determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including:  \n(a) the expected usage of the asset by the entity and whether the asset could be managed efficiently\nby another management team;  \n(b) typical product life cycles for the asset and public information on estimates of useful lives of\nsimilar assets that are used in a similar way;  \n(c) technical, technological, commercial or other types of obsolescence;  \n(d) the stability of the industry in which the asset operates and changes in the market demand for the\nproducts or services output from the asset;  \n(e) expected actions by competitors or potential competitors;  \n(f) the level of maintenance expenditure required to obtain the expected future economic benefits\nfrom the asset and the entity\u2019s ability and intention to reach such a level;  \n(g) the period of control over the asset and legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the\nexpiry dates of related leases; and  \n(h) whether the useful life of the asset is dependent on the useful life of other assets of the entity.  \n91 The term \u2018indefinite\u2019 does not mean \u2018infinite\u2019. The useful life of an intangible asset reflects only that level\nof future maintenance expenditure required to maintain the asset at its standard of performance assessed at\nthe time of estimating the asset\u2019s useful life, and the entity\u2019s ability and intention to reach such a level. A\nconclusion that the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite should not depend on planned future\nexpenditure in excess of that required to maintain the asset at that standard of performance.  \n92 Given the history of rapid changes in technology, computer software and many other intangible assets are\nsusceptible to technological obsolescence. Therefore, it will often be the case that their useful life is short.\nExpected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an intangible asset could\nindicate the expectation of technological or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might\nreflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.  \n93 The useful life of an intangible asset may be very long or even indefinite. Uncertainty justifies estimating\nthe useful life of an intangible asset on a prudent basis, but it does not justify choosing a life that is\nunrealistically short.  \n**94** **The useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual or other legal rights shall not exceed**\n**the period of the contractual or other legal rights, but may be shorter depending on the period over**\n**which the entity expects to use the asset. If the contractual or other legal rights are conveyed for a**\n**limited term that can be renewed, the useful life of the intangible asset shall include the renewal**\n**period(s) only if there is evidence to support renewal by the entity without significant cost. The useful**\n**life of a reacquired right recognised as an intangible asset in a business combination is the remaining**\n**contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted and shall not include renewal**\n**periods.**  \n95 There may be both economic and legal factors influencing the useful life of an intangible asset. Economic\nfactors determine the period over which future economic benefits will be received by the entity. Legal\nfactors may restrict the period over which the entity controls access to these benefits. The useful life is the\nshorter of the periods determined by these factors.  \n96 Existence of the following factors, among others, indicates that an entity would be able to renew the\ncontractual or other legal rights without significant cost:  \n(a) there is evidence, possibly based on experience, that the contractual or other legal rights will be\nrenewed. If renewal is contingent upon the consent of a third party, this includes evidence that the\nthird party will give its consent;  \n(b) there is evidence that any conditions necessary to obtain renewal will be satisfied; and  \n(c) the cost to the entity of renewal is not significant when compared with the future economic\nbenefits expected to flow to the entity from renewal.  \nIf the cost of renewal is significant when compared with the future economic benefits expected to flow to\nthe entity from renewal, the \u2018renewal\u2019 cost represents, in substance, the cost to acquire a new intangible\nasset at the renewal date.  \n-----  ",

Amortisation shall begin when the asset is available for use, ie**\n**when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner**\n**intended by management. Amortisation shall cease at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified**\n**as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with**\n**AASB 5 and the date that the asset is derecognised. The amortisation method used shall reflect the**\n**pattern in which the asset\u2019s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity. If**\n**that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used. The amortisation**\n**charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss unless this or another Standard permits or**\n**requires it to be included in the carrying amount of another asset.**  \n98 A variety of amortisation methods can be used to allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a\nsystematic basis over its useful life. These methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing\nbalance method and the units of production method. The method used is selected on the basis of the\nexpected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset and is\napplied consistently from period to period, unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption\nof those future economic benefits.  \n98A There is a rebuttable presumption that an amortisation method that is based on the revenue generated by an\nactivity that includes the use of an intangible asset is inappropriate. The revenue generated by an activity\nthat includes the use of an intangible asset typically reflects factors that are not directly linked to the\nconsumption of the economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset. For example, revenue is affected by\nother inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes and prices. The price component\nof revenue may be affected by inflation, which has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is consumed.\nThis presumption can be overcome only in the limited circumstances:  \n(a) in which the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue, as described in paragraph 98C;\nor  \n(b) when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the\nintangible asset are highly correlated.  \n98B In choosing an appropriate amortisation method in accordance with paragraph 98, an entity could determine\nthe predominant limiting factor that is inherent in the intangible asset. For example, the contract that sets\nout the entity\u2019s rights over its use of an intangible asset might specify the entity\u2019s use of the intangible asset\nas a predetermined number of years (ie time), as a number of units produced or as a fixed total amount of\nrevenue to be generated. Identification of such a predominant limiting factor could serve as the starting\npoint for the identification of the appropriate basis of amortisation, but another basis may be applied if it\nmore closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of economic benefits.  \n98C In the circumstance in which the predominant limiting factor that is inherent in an intangible asset is the\nachievement of a revenue threshold, the revenue to be generated can be an appropriate basis for\namortisation. For example, an entity could acquire a concession to explore and extract gold from a gold\nmine. The expiry of the contract might be based on a fixed amount of total revenue to be generated from the\nextraction (for example, a contract may allow the extraction of gold from the mine until total cumulative\nrevenue from the sale of gold reaches CU2 billion) and not be based on time or on the amount of gold\nextracted. In another example, the right to operate a toll road could be based on a fixed total amount of\nrevenue to be generated from cumulative tolls charged (for example, a contract could allow operation of the\ntoll road until the cumulative amount of tolls generated from operating the road reaches CU100 million). In\nthe case in which revenue has been established as the predominant limiting factor in the contract for the use\nof the intangible asset, the revenue that is to be generated might be an appropriate basis for amortising the\nintangible asset, provided that the contract specifies a fixed total amount of revenue to be generated on\nwhich amortisation is to be determined.  \n99 Amortisation is usually recognised in profit or loss. However, sometimes the future economic benefits\nembodied in an asset are absorbed in producing other assets. In this case, the amortisation charge constitutes\npart of the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount. For example, the amortisation of\nintangible assets used in a production process is included in the carrying amount of inventories (see\nAASB 102 Inventories).  \n-----  ",

At the acquisition date the acquirer expected to continue producing the\nline, and an analysis of various economic factors indicated there was no limit to the period the trademark would\ncontribute to net cash inflows. Consequently, the trademark was not amortised by the acquirer. However, management\nhas recently decided that production of the product line will be discontinued over the next four years.  \nBecause the useful life of the acquired trademark is no longer regarded as indefinite, the carrying amount of the\ntrademark would be tested for impairment in accordance with AASB 136 and amortised over its remaining four-year\nuseful life.  \n-----  ",

Thus, the entity shall not adjust the carrying\namount of intangible assets recognised at that date. However, the entity shall, at that date, apply\nthis Standard to reassess the useful lives of such intangible assets. If, as a result of that\nreassessment, the entity changes its assessment of the useful life of an asset, that change shall be\naccounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8.  \n130A An entity shall apply the amendments in paragraph 2 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2006. If an entity applies IFRS 6 for an earlier period, those amendments shall be applied for that earlier\nperiod.  \n130B IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 2007) amended the terminology used throughout\nIFRSs. In addition it amended paragraphs 85, 86 and 118(e)(iii). An entity shall apply those amendments\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. If an entity applies IAS 1 (revised 2007) for an\nearlier period, the amendments shall be applied for that earlier period.  \n130D Paragraphs 69, 70 and 98 were amended and paragraph 69A was added by Improvements to IFRSs issued in\nMay 2008. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2009. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period it shall\ndisclose that fact.  \n130F IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 _Joint Arrangements, issued in May 2011, amended paragraph 3(e). An entity shall_\napply that amendment when it applies IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.  \n130G IFRS 13, issued in May 2011, amended paragraphs 8, 33, 47, 50, 75, 78, 82, 84, 100 and 124 and deleted\nparagraphs 39\u201341 and 130E. An entity shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 13.  \n131 The requirement in paragraphs 129 and 130(b) to apply this Standard prospectively means that if an\nexchange of assets was measured before the effective date of this Standard on the basis of the carrying\namount of the asset given up, the entity does not restate the carrying amount of the asset acquired to reflect\nits fair value at the acquisition date.  \n132 Entities to which paragraph 130 applies are encouraged to apply the requirements of this Standard before\nthe effective dates specified in paragraph 130. However, if an entity applies this Standard before those\neffective dates, it also shall apply IFRS 3 and IAS 36 (as revised in 2004) at the same time.  \n133 This Standard supersedes IAS 38 Intangible Assets (issued in 1998).  \n-----  ",
