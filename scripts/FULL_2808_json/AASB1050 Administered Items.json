The principles in that Standard are applied in disclosing administered income and\nexpenses reliably attributable to activities in accordance with paragraphs 7(a)(ii) and 7(b)(ii) of this Standard.  \n9 A government department\u2019s operating statement only recognises income and expenses of the government\ndepartment. Similarly, a government department\u2019s statement of financial position only recognises assets that\nthe government department controls and liabilities that involve a future sacrifice of the government\ndepartment\u2019s assets.  \n10 Items recognised in the statement of financial position include the assets and liabilities of the trusts that the\ngovernment department controls and from whose activities the government department obtains benefits.  \n11 The responsibilities of a government department may encompass the levying or collection of taxes, fines and\nfees, the provision of goods and services at a charge to recipients, and the transfer of funds to eligible\nbeneficiaries. These activities may give rise to income and expenses that are not attributable to the\ngovernment department. This occurs, for example, where the government department is unable to use for its\nown purposes the proceeds of user charges, taxes, fines and fees it collects without further authorisation, or\nwhere the transfer of funds to eligible beneficiaries does not involve a reduction in the assets recognised in\nthe government department\u2019s statement of financial position. In addition, the government department may\nmanage government assets in the capacity of an agent and may incur liabilities that, for example, while\ninvolving a future disbursement from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or other Fund will not involve a\nsacrifice of the assets that the government department controls as at the end of the reporting period. This\nadministered income and these administered expenses, assets and liabilities are not recognised in the\ngovernment department\u2019s operating statement or statement of financial position.  \n12 A government department\u2019s ability to control all, or a portion of, the proceeds of the user charges, fines and\nfees it levies may be subject to complex arrangements. Consistent with those arrangements, where a\ngovernment department does not control any of the proceeds of the user charges, fines and fees that it levies,\nit does not recognise any of the proceeds of those user charges, fines and fees as income. Similarly, where,\nas a result of automatic appropriations or other authority, a government department controls some but not all\nof the proceeds of user charges, fines and fees, the department recognises as income only those amounts that\nit controls.  \n13 If taxes, fines, fees and other amounts that are not controlled by a government department were to be\nrecognised as assets or income by the collecting government department, users could incorrectly assume that\nthese amounts were available for the government department\u2019s use.  \n14 The tax revenues, user charges, fines and fees administered by a government department and the amount of\nfunds transferred to eligible beneficiaries are an important indicator of the government department\u2019s\nperformance in achieving its objectives. Therefore, paragraph 7 requires disclosure of income and expenses\nadministered by a government department that are not recognised in the government department\u2019s operating\nstatement. Disclosure of this information by major class and by activity facilitates an assessment of activity\ncosts and cost recoveries, and is therefore relevant to parliamentary decision making and enhances the\ndischarge of accountability obligations. Even though a government department does not control such items,\nthe effective and efficient administration of these items is an important role of the government department.",

This is because the agency\nresponsible for collecting taxes does not normally control the future economic benefits embodied in tax\ncollections. Similarly, Treasury may be responsible for bank accounts into which tax collections are\ndeposited, but until parliament has \u2018appropriated funds\u2019 for Treasury use or authorised the Treasury to make\npayments, the Treasury will not control those tax revenues.  \n16 Parliamentary appropriations made to enable the tax collection agency to perform its services are income of\nthat agency.

If these amounts were recognised as income\non receipt by the government department and as expenses on payment by the government department, users\ncould incorrectly assume that the government department controlled these amounts. Nevertheless, this\nStandard requires such amounts to be disclosed in the complete set of financial statements because that\ninformation may be relevant for understanding the government department\u2019s financial performance, including\nassessments of accountability. Even though a government department does not control such items, their\neffective and efficient administration is an important role of the government department.  \n18 Consistent with a government department\u2019s objectives and with legislation or other authority, amounts\nappropriated to government departments may include amounts to be transferred to third parties or recoupment\nof such amounts previously transferred by the government department. Such transfers may encompass\npayments for unemployment benefits, family allowances, age and invalid pensions, disaster relief, and grants\nand subsidies made to other governments or to other government or private sector entities.  \n19 Whether a government department recognises the amounts appropriated for transfer during the reporting\nperiod as income, and the amounts transferred during that reporting period as expenses, depends on whether\nthe government department controls the assets to be transferred, and whether the amounts subsequently\ntransferred constitute a reduction in the net assets of the government department.  \n20 Where amounts are transferred to eligible beneficiaries and the identity of the beneficiaries and the amounts\nto be transferred to them are determined by reference to legislation or other authority, it is unlikely that the\ngovernment department controls the funds to be transferred. The government department is merely the agent\nresponsible for the administration of the transfer process. As such, the government department does not\nbenefit from the assets held for transfer, nor does it have the capacity to deny or regulate the access of eligible\nbeneficiaries to the assets. Accordingly, the government department does not recognise assets and income in\nrespect of amounts appropriated for transfer, nor expenses in respect of the amounts subsequently transferred.  \n21 Although transfers not controlled by a government department do not qualify for recognition in the financial\nstatements, information about their nature and amount is relevant for understanding the government\ndepartment\u2019s financial performance.  \n22 **Details of the broad categories of recipients and the amounts transferred to those recipients shall be**\n**disclosed in the government department\u2019s complete set of financial statements.**  \n23 In some cases it may not be clear whether the government department controls amounts to be transferred to\neligible beneficiaries. For example, amounts may be appropriated to a government department for subsequent\ntransfer, but the government department can exercise significant discretion in determining the amount or\ntiming of payment, the identity of beneficiaries and the conditions under which the payments are to be made.\nIn such cases, preparers and auditors use their judgement in deciding whether the government department\ncontrols the amounts to be transferred.",

The Board\nconcluded that differences should be removed, where appropriate and timely, to improve the overall\nquality of financial reporting;  \n(b) bring requirements applicable to local governments, government departments and governments upto-date with contemporary accounting thought;  \n(c) consider the implications of the outcomes of its project on the harmonisation of Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS), in particular on the\nrequirements in AAS 31;  \n(d) decide whether the encouragements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 should be made mandatory or removed;\nand  \n(e) remove uncertainty in the application of cross-references to other Australian Accounting Standards\nand the override provisions in AASs 27, 29 and 31 that made the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and\n31 take precedence over other requirements.  \nBC3 The Board considered the following alternative mechanisms for implementing the approach of updating and\nimproving the requirements for local governments, government departments and governments:  \n**(a)** review the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 and where appropriate:  \n(i) amend other Australian Accounting Standards to pick up any issues that are addressed in\nAASs 27, 29 and 31 that are not adequately addressed in the latest Australian Accounting\nStandards and have them apply to local governments, government departments and\ngovernments; or  \n(ii) create public sector specific topic-based Standards;  \nand consequently withdraw AASs 27, 29 and 31; or  \n**(b)** review AASs 27, 29 and 31 and re-issue them in light of the latest Australian Accounting Standards,\nretaining/amending where necessary any issues that are addressed in AASs 27, 29 and 31 that are\nnot adequately addressed in the latest Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC4 The Board chose alternative (a), given the improvements in the quality of financial reporting by local\ngovernments, government departments and governments since AASs 27, 29 and 31 were first issued.  \nBC5 Where the Board identified that the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 could be improved within time and\nresource constraints, improvements have been made. Much of the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 has been\nretained substantively unamended.  Improvements will be progressed in due course in line with the AASB\u2019s\nPublic Sector Policy Paper Australian Accounting Standards and Public Sector Entities.  \nBC6 The first stage of the short-term review of the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 was the preparation of a\nparagraph-by-paragraph analysis of each of AASs 27, 29 and 31, listing each paragraph of each Standard\nalongside corresponding Standards or other pronouncements that would apply to local governments,\ngovernment departments or governments in the absence of AASs 27, 29 and 31. The Board\u2019s conclusions\nand rationale for the treatment of each paragraph in the context of the review were also provided in the\nanalysis. The Board\u2019s primary focus was on dealing with the requirements from the three Standards in such\na way as to not leave a vacuum.  \n-----  BC7 Each paragraph from AASs 27, 29 and 31 was classified as being:  \n**(a)** no longer needed or adequately dealt with in other Standards;  \n**(b)** more appropriately dealt with in other Standards; or  \n**(c)** not adequately and/or appropriately dealt with in other Standards and therefore should be retained\nor improved and incorporated into other Standards.  \nThe paragraph-by-paragraph analyses considered by the AASB in developing the Exposure Draft ED 156\n_Proposals Arising from the Short-term Review of the Requirements in AAS 27, AAS 29 and AAS 31 that gave_\nrise to this Standard are available on the AASB website. They support, but do not form part of, this Basis for\nConclusions.  \nBC8 In reviewing the paragraphs, the Board noted that some material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 would, under the\ncurrent style of writing Standards, be located in a separate Basis for Conclusions. For example, paragraph\n6.3.12 of AAS 29 provides a rationale for the disclosure of information about administered items. Given the\nshort-term nature of the review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, the Board concluded that explanations of technical\nissues that both originated in and are being relocated from AASs 27, 29 and 31 should, when appropriate, be\nlocated in the body of the Standard to which the relevant requirements are being relocated.  \nBC9 The Board decided not to retain the illustrative general purpose financial reports provided in AASs 27, 29\nand 31, because their purpose, which was to provide an educational tool in the initial stages of accrual\nreporting by local governments, government departments and governments, is no longer needed.  \nBC10 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions focuses on issues specific to administered items.",

The Board concluded\nthat the encouragement should be removed. This is in acknowledgement of the implementation difficulties\nrelated to the lack of clarity in the short term about the definition of \u2018items that a government department\ncollects or distributes on behalf of another entity that are neither controlled nor administered items\u2019. The\nBoard noted that this issue will be addressed as part of the planned longer-term more fundamental review of\nrequirements relating to administered items.  \nBC16 Also consistent with paragraph BC2(d), the Board decided that, although transfers not controlled by a\ngovernment department (such as, in general, pensions paid to beneficiaries) do not qualify for recognition,\ndetails of the broad categories of recipients and the amounts transferred to those recipients should be required\nto be disclosed in a complete set of financial statements (see paragraph 22 of this Standard). This is because\nthe resulting information is relevant for understanding the government department\u2019s financial performance.  \nBC17 Paragraph 12.9.4 of AAS 29 encouraged the disclosure of information about administered assets and\nadministered liabilities on an activity basis.
