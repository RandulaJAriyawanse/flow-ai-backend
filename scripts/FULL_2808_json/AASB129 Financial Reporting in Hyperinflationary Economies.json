Money loses purchasing power at such a rate that comparison of amounts\nfrom transactions and other events that have occurred at different times, even within the same accounting\nperiod, is misleading.  \n3 This Standard does not establish an absolute rate at which hyperinflation is deemed to arise. It is a matter of\njudgement when restatement of financial statements in accordance with this Standard becomes necessary.\nHyperinflation is indicated by characteristics of the economic environment of a country which include, but\nare not limited to, the following:  \n(a) the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable\nforeign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain\npurchasing power;  \n(b) the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms\nof a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;  \n(c) sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of\npurchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;  \n(d) interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index; and  \n(e) the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.  \n4 It is preferable that all entities that report in the currency of the same hyperinflationary economy apply this\nStandard from the same date. Nevertheless, this Standard applies to the financial statements of any entity\nfrom the beginning of the reporting period in which it identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the\ncountry in whose currency it reports.",

        "page_content=": "## The restatement of financial statements  \n5 Prices change over time as the result of various specific or general political, economic and social forces.\nSpecific forces such as changes in supply and demand and technological changes may cause individual\nprices to increase or decrease significantly and independently of each other. In addition, general forces may\nresult in changes in the general level of prices and therefore in the general purchasing power of money.  \n6 Entities that prepare financial statements on the historical cost basis of accounting do so without regard\neither to changes in the general level of prices or to increases in specific prices of recognised assets or\nliabilities. The exceptions to this are those assets and liabilities that the entity is required, or chooses, to\nmeasure at fair value. For example, property, plant and equipment may be revalued to fair value and\nbiological assets are generally required to be measured at fair value. Some entities, however, present\nfinancial statements that are based on a current cost approach that reflects the effects of changes in the\nspecific prices of assets held.  \n7 In a hyperinflationary economy, financial statements, whether they are based on a historical cost approach\nor a current cost approach, are useful only if they are expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the\nend of the reporting period. As a result, this Standard applies to the financial statements of entities reporting  \n-----  in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy. Presentation of the information required by this Standard as\na supplement to unrestated financial statements is not permitted. Furthermore, separate presentation of the\nfinancial statements before restatement is discouraged.  \n**8** **The financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary**\n**economy, whether they are based on a historical cost approach or a current cost approach, shall be**\n**stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. The corresponding**\n**figures for the previous period required by AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and any**\n**information in respect of earlier periods shall also be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at**\n**the end of the reporting period. For the purpose of presenting comparative amounts in a different**\n**presentation currency, paragraphs 42(b) and 43 of AASB 121** **_The Effects of Changes in Foreign_**\n**_Exchange Rates apply._**  \n**9** **The gain or loss on the net monetary position shall be included in profit or loss and separately**\n**disclosed.**  \n10 The restatement of financial statements in accordance with this Standard requires the application of certain\nprocedures as well as judgement. The consistent application of these procedures and judgements from\nperiod to period is more important than the precise accuracy of the resulting amounts included in the\nrestated financial statements.",

Monetary items are money held and items to be received or paid in money.  \n13 Assets and liabilities linked by agreement to changes in prices, such as index linked bonds and loans, are\nadjusted in accordance with the agreement in order to ascertain the amount outstanding at the end of the\nreporting period. These items are carried at this adjusted amount in the restated statement of financial\nposition.  \n14 All other assets and liabilities are non-monetary. Some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at\nthe end of the reporting period, such as net realisable value and fair value, so they are not restated. All other\nnon-monetary assets and liabilities are restated.  \n15 Most non-monetary items are carried at cost or cost less depreciation; hence they are expressed at amounts\ncurrent at their date of acquisition. The restated cost, or cost less depreciation, of each item is determined by\napplying to its historical cost and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the\ndate of acquisition to the end of the reporting period. For example, property, plant and equipment,\ninventories of raw materials and merchandise, goodwill, patents, trademarks and similar assets are restated\nfrom the dates of their purchase. Inventories of partly-finished and finished goods are restated from the\ndates on which the costs of purchase and of conversion were incurred.  \n16 Detailed records of the acquisition dates of items of property, plant and equipment may not be available or\ncapable of estimation. In these rare circumstances, it may be necessary, in the first period of application of\nthis Standard, to use an independent professional assessment of the value of the items as the basis for their\nrestatement.  \n17 A general price index may not be available for the periods for which the restatement of property, plant and\nequipment is required by this Standard. In these circumstances, it may be necessary to use an estimate\nbased, for example, on the movements in the exchange rate between the functional currency and a relatively\nstable foreign currency.  \n18 Some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at dates other than that of acquisition or that of the\nstatement of financial position, for example property, plant and equipment that has been revalued at some\nearlier date. In these cases, the carrying amounts are restated from the date of the revaluation.  \n19 The restated amount of a non-monetary item is reduced, in accordance with appropriate Australian\nAccounting Standards, when it exceeds its recoverable amount. For example, restated amounts of property,\nplant and equipment, goodwill, patents and trademarks are reduced to recoverable amount and restated\namounts of inventories are reduced to net realisable value.  \n20 An investee that is accounted for under the equity method may report in the currency of a hyperinflationary\neconomy. The statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income of such an investee  \n-----  are restated in accordance with this Standard in order to calculate the investor\u2019s share of its net assets and\nprofit or loss. When the restated financial statements of the investee are expressed in a foreign currency they\nare translated at closing rates.  \n21 The impact of inflation is usually recognised in borrowing costs. It is not appropriate both to restate the\ncapital expenditure financed by borrowing and to capitalise that part of the borrowing costs that\ncompensates for the inflation during the same period. This part of the borrowing costs is recognised as an\nexpense in the period in which the costs are incurred.  \n22 An entity may acquire assets under an arrangement that permits it to defer payment without incurring an\nexplicit interest charge. Where it is impracticable to impute the amount of interest, such assets are restated\nfrom the payment date and not the date of purchase.  \n23 [Deleted]  \n24 At the beginning of the first period of application of this Standard, the components of owners\u2019 equity,\nexcept retained earnings and any revaluation surplus, are restated by applying a general price index from the\ndates the components were contributed or otherwise arose. Any revaluation surplus that arose in previous\nperiods is eliminated. Restated retained earnings are derived from all the other amounts in the restated\nstatement of financial position.  \n25 At the end of the first period and in subsequent periods, all components of owners\u2019 equity are restated by\napplying a general price index from the beginning of the period or the date of contribution, if later. The\nmovements for the period in owners\u2019 equity are disclosed in accordance with AASB 101.",
