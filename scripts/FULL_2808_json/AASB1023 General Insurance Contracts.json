        "page_content=": "## Deposit Components  \n2.4.1 Some general insurance contracts contain both an insurance component and a deposit component. In some\ncases, an insurer is required or permitted to unbundle those components.  \n(a) Unbundling is required if both the following conditions are met:  \n(i) the insurer can measure the deposit component (including any embedded surrender\noptions) separately (that is, without considering the insurance component); and  \n(ii) the insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not otherwise require it to recognise all obligations\nand rights arising from the deposit component.  \n(b) Unbundling is permitted, but not required, if the insurer can measure the deposit component\nseparately as in paragraph 2.4.1(a)(i) but its accounting policies require it to recognise all\nobligations and rights arising from the deposit component, regardless of the basis used to measure\nthose rights and obligations.  \n(c) Unbundling is prohibited if an insurer cannot measure the deposit component separately as in\nparagraph 2.4.1(a)(i).  \n2.4.2 The following is an example of a case when an insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not require it to recognise\nall obligations arising from a deposit component. A cedant receives compensation for losses from a\n_reinsurer, but the contract obliges the cedant to repay the compensation in future years. That obligation_\narises from a deposit component. If the cedant\u2019s accounting policies would otherwise permit it to recognise\nthe compensation as income without recognising the resulting obligation, unbundling is required.  \n2.4.3 A general insurer, in considering the need to unbundle the deposit component of the general insurance\ncontract, would consider all expected cash flows over the period of the contract and would consider the\nsubstance of the contract. For example, while some financial reinsurance contracts may require annual\nrenewal, in substance they may be expected to be renewed for a number of years.  \n2.4.4 To unbundle a general insurance contract, an insurer shall:  \n(a) apply this Standard to the insurance component; and  \n(b) apply AASB 9 to the deposit component. When applying AASB 9, an insurer shall designate the\ndeposit component as \u201cat fair value through profit or loss\u201d, on first application of this Standard or\non initial recognition of the deposit component.",

The amounts collected in respect of these components\nare income of an insurer on the basis that they are collected in consideration for the insurer rendering\nservices by indemnifying those insured against specified losses.  \n4.2.2 For certain classes of general insurance business, government authorities may require the payment of levies\nand charges. For example, workers\u2019 compensation insurance levies, annual licence fees and fire brigade\ncharges may apply. Such levies and charges are expenses of the insurer, rather than government charges\ndirectly upon those insured. The insurer is not acting simply as a collector of these levies and charges.\nAlthough not compelled to collect these amounts from those insured, the insurer is entitled to include in\npremiums an amount to cover the estimated amount of the levies and charges. The insurer is usually\nresponsible for paying the levies and charges at a later date. The amount paid by the insurer does not\ndepend on the amounts collected from those insured in relation to the levies and charges. Therefore, the\namounts collected to meet levies and charges are income of the insurer. The insurer accrues for all levies\nand charges expected under the general insurance contracts written in the period.  \n4.2.3 In most States, stamp duty is charged on individual general insurance contracts and is separately identified\nby insurers on policy documents. The insurer is normally required to collect and pass on to the government\nan equivalent amount. Because such stamp duty is a tax collected on behalf of a third party and there is no\nchoice on the part of the insurer but to collect the duty from the insured, it is not income of the insurer.\nSimilarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not income of the insurer.  \n4.2.4 Premium revenue needs to be recognised from the date of the attachment of risk in relation to each general\ninsurance contract because insurers earn premium revenue by assuming insurance risks from that date on\nbehalf of those insured. However, for reasons of practicality, many general insurers use bases of\nrecognition that attempt to approximate this date. Such bases are acceptable provided that they do not result\nin the recognition of a materially different amount of premium revenue in a particular reporting period than\nwould be the case if recognition occurred from the date of attachment of risk for each general insurance\ncontract.  \n4.2.5 In recognising premium from the attachment date, an insurer may recognise premiums relating to general\ninsurance contracts when the contract period commences after the reporting period, commonly referred to\nas premiums in advance. The attachment date is the date from which an insurer accepts risk. An insurer\nmay accept risk prior to the date a contract commences: for example, it is not unusual for insurers to issue\nrenewals, and for renewals to be paid for by policyholders, prior to the commencement date of an insurance\ncontract. For commercial lines insurance, where the policyholder may be using the services of an insurance\nbroker, the renewal terms could be agreed by both the insurer and policyholder prior to the commencement\ndate and before the policyholder has paid the premium. In this situation, there may also have been a\ntransfer of risk. As premiums in advance relate entirely to insurance cover to be provided in a future period,\npremiums in advance are recognised as part of the unearned premium liability. Premiums in advance are\nconsidered as part of the liability adequacy test required by section 9.  \n-----  _Reinsurance premiums_  \n4.2.6 From the perspective of the reinsurer, reinsurance premiums accepted are akin to premiums accepted by a\ndirect insurer. The reinsurer recognises inwards reinsurance premiums ceded to it as revenue in the same\nway as a direct insurer treats the acceptance of direct premiums as revenue.  \n4.2.7 Premiums accepted by the reinsurer are recognised from the attachment date, that is, the date from which\nthe reinsurer bears its proportion of the relevant risks underwritten by the cedant. Reinsurers usually use\nbases of recognition that approximate the dates of bearing the risks. For example, the reinsurer may assume\nthat its acceptance of risks occurs from the middle of the period for which the aggregate ceded premiums\nare advised by the cedant. This approach is acceptable provided that the premiums received or receivable in\nrespect of the reporting period are recognised in that period, whether or not the periodic advice from the\ncedant has been received.",

Where this is not possible, the**\n**deposit premium, adjusted for any other relevant information, shall be recognised as the premium**\n**revenue, provided that it is expected that this amount will not be materially different from the actual**\n**amount of premium.**  \n4.4.1 Premium revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when it has been earned. An\ninsurance contract involves the transfer of significant insurance risk. The insurer estimates the pattern of\nthe incidence of risk over the period of the contract for direct business, or over the period of indemnity for\nreinsurance business, and the premium revenue is recognised in accordance with this pattern. This results in\nthe allocation of the premium revenue and the _claims incurred expense and hence the gross underwriting_\nresult over the period of the contract for direct business, or over the period of indemnity for reinsurance\nbusiness, in accordance with the pattern of the incidence of risk.  \n4.4.2 Measuring premium revenue involves the following steps:  \n(a) estimating the total amount of premium revenue expected under the contract;  \n(b) estimating the total amount of claims expenses expected under the contract and estimating when\nthe claims are expected to arise;  \n(c) estimating the pattern of the incidence of risk from the result of (b); and  \n(d) recognising the premium revenue under the contract identified in (a) when it will be earned, that\nis, in accordance with the pattern of the incidence of risk determined in (c).  \n4.4.3 For some general insurance contracts, especially complex multi-year reinsurance contracts, these\nestimations involve the use of significant judgement. The estimates are reassessed at the end of each\nreporting period. This prospective estimate of all of the income and expenses expected under the contract is\nalso necessary for the purposes of the liability adequacy test. Refer to section 9.  \n_Direct business_  \n4.4.4 For most direct general insurance contracts the specified period of the contract is one year. For many direct\ninsurance contracts the pattern of the incidence of risk will be linear, that is, the risk of events occurring that\nwill give rise to claims is evenly spread throughout the contract period. For these contracts the premium\nrevenue will be earned evenly over the period of the contract. However, for some direct insurance contracts\nthe risk of events occurring that will give rise to claims is not evenly spread throughout the contract. For\nexample, with motor insurance contracts, the risk of events occurring that will give rise to claims may be\nsubject to seasonal factors.  \n4.4.5 Insurers estimate the pattern of the incidence of risk expected under the general insurance contracts from the\nattachment date. An insurer may be able to reliably estimate the pattern for a particular type of insurance\nbusiness based upon past experience. However, when there have been changes in the nature of the cover\nprovided, or, when there has been a change in loss experience, the insurer reflects this in the estimations.  \n-----  _Reinsurance business_  \n4.4.6 Reinsurers recognise reinsurance premiums over the period of indemnity provided by the reinsurance\ncontract in accordance with the pattern of the incidence of risk. For a typical twelve-month proportional\ntreaty, such as a quota share treaty, written on a \u201crisks attaching basis\u201d, the period of indemnity will be\ntwenty-four months, as the proportional treaty will indemnify the direct insurer (or, for retrocession, the\nreinsurer) for losses arising under direct policies written during the twelve-month contract period. Hence,\nan underlying annual direct contract written on the last day of the reinsurance contract has twelve months of\ninsurance cover beyond the last day of the reinsurance contract. The reinsurer estimates the pattern of the\nincidence of risk over the twenty-four-month indemnity period.  \n4.4.7 The reinsurer may be able to reliably estimate the pattern for a particular type of reinsurance business based\nupon past experience. The reinsurer is likely to seek information from the cedant to estimate the pattern of\nthe incidence of loss expected. When there have been changes in the nature of the cover provided or when\nthere has been a change in loss experience the insurer will need to reflect this in the estimations.  \n4.4.8 To determine the pattern of the incidence of risk, reinsurers first determine the total reinsurance premiums\nexpected under the contract. The premiums receivable under reinsurance treaties often depend on the\nvolume of business written by the cedant after the reporting period but before the treaty expiry date. This is\nalways true of proportional (quota share and surplus) treaties that span the end of the reporting period, and\nis often true of non-proportional treaties. For such treaties, to estimate the total premium revenue expected\nunder the reinsurance contract, the reinsurer estimates the inwards reinsurance premium it will receive\nunder the contract by estimating the gross premium revenue that the cedant is likely to receive. The\nreinsurer is likely to estimate this by communicating with the cedant, and by reviewing past experience.  \n4.4.9 For a typical non-proportional treaty, such as an excess of loss treaty, the period of indemnity is usually the\nsame as the contract period. For example, an excess of loss treaty could indemnify a cedant for all claims\nincurred above the excess (either individual claims or in aggregate) during the contract period, or for all\nclaims made during the contract period. For some of these contracts the pattern of the incidence of risk is\nlikely to be linear and hence for these contracts the premium revenue expected under the contract is earned\nevenly over the contract period.  \n4.4.10 With a non-proportional treaty the reinsurer estimates the total liabilities that are likely to arise under the\nunderlying insurance contracts to enable an estimation of the total inwards reinsurance premium revenue\nexpected under the contract. Where relevant, the reinsurer estimates whether the cedant is likely to want to\nreinstate the contract, in which case the reinsurer considers the additional reinstatement premiums it is\nexpected to receive and the extent that they may have been earned at the end of the reporting period. A\nreinsurer liaises closely with the cedant, reviews any market information on significant losses or events that\nmay have arisen, for example a hailstorm or earthquake, and reviews past experience.  \n4.4.11 Some reinsurance contracts might involve an experience account. Whilst such contracts may require annual\nrenewal, in substance the contract period is likely to be greater than one year. In estimating the total\ninwards reinsurance premium expected under the contract and in estimating the total reinsurance claims, to\ndetermine the pattern of the incidence of risk, the reinsurer considers the probability-weighted expected\ncash flows over the expected period of the contract, and discounts these cash flows to reflect the time value\nof money. Section 6 discusses the determination of discount rates. In determining the expected cash flows,\nthe reinsurer considers any cash flows such as profit commissions and commission rebates.  \n_Adjusted premiums_  \n4.4.12 For some classes of insurance it is usual for the premium to be adjusted as a result of events and information\nthat only become known during or after the insurance contract period. For example, marine cargo insurance\nis a type of \u201cadjustable\u201d business for which a deposit premium is paid at the beginning of the contract\nperiod and subsequently adjusted on the basis of a cargo declaration.",

Regard is had to the robustness\nof the valuation models, the reliability and volume of available data, past experience of the insurer and the\nindustry and the characteristics of the classes of business written.  \n5.1.8 The risk margin is applied to the net outstanding claims for the entity as a whole.

        "page_content=": "## Expected Future Payments  \n**5.2** **The expected future payments shall include:**  \n**(a)** **amounts in relation to unpaid reported claims;**  \n**(b)** **claims incurred but not reported (IBNR);**  \n**(c)** **claims incurred but not enough reported (IBNER); and**  \n**(d)** **costs, including claims handling costs, which the insurer expects to incur in settling these**\n**incurred claims.**  \n5.2.1 It is important to identify the components of the ultimate cost to an insurer of settling incurred claims, for\nthe purposes of determining the claims expense for the reporting period and determining the outstanding\nclaims liability as at the end of the reporting period. These components comprise the policy benefit\namounts required to be paid to or on behalf of those insured, and claims handling costs, that is, costs\nassociated with achieving settlements with those insured. Claims handling costs include costs that can be\nassociated directly with individual claims, such as legal and other professional fees, and costs that can only\nbe indirectly associated with individual claims, such as claims administration costs.  \n5.2.2 Policy benefit amounts and direct claims handling costs are expenses of an insurer, representing the\nconsumption or loss of economic benefits. The outstanding claims liability includes unpaid policy benefits\nand direct claims handling costs relating to claims arising during current and prior reporting periods, as they\nare outgoings that an insurer is presently obliged to meet as a result of past events.  \n5.2.3 Indirect claims handling costs incurred during the reporting period are also expenses of an insurer, and\ninclude a portion of the indirect claims handling costs to be paid in the future, being that portion which\nrelates to handling claims incurred during the reporting period. The outstanding claims liability includes\nthese unpaid indirect claims handling costs.  \n5.2.4 It is important to ensure that claims are recognised as expenses and liabilities for the correct reporting\nperiod. For contracts written on a claims incurred basis, claims arise from insured events that occur during\nthe insurance contract period. Some events will occur and give rise to claims that are reported to the insurer\nand settled within the same reporting period. Other reported claims may be unsettled at the end of a\nparticular reporting period. In addition, there may be events that give rise to claims that, at the end of a\nreporting period, have yet to be reported to the insurer. The latter are termed claims incurred but not\nreported (IBNR claims). The insurer also considers the need to recognise a liability for claims that may be\nre-opened after the reporting period.  \n5.2.5 For contracts written on a claims made basis, claims arise in respect of claims reported during the insurance\ncontract period. The insured event that gave rise to the claim could have occurred in a previous period.\nWhile claims made insurance contracts should theoretically only give rise to outstanding claims liabilities\nand IBNER claims (see paragraph 5.2.10), as claims cannot be incurred but not reported under such a\ncontract, this may not be the case for reinsurers. A reinsurer may have reinsured a claims made contract on\na claims incurred basis. In this case whilst a loss or other event would be reported to the direct insurer\nduring the period of insurance to generate a valid claim, the reinsurer may not have received information\nabout the claim but would have an IBNR liability. Similarly, a reinsurer may have issued a claims made\nreinsurance contract but may need to consider that not all notices of claims may have been reported by the\ndirect insurer. Insurers and reinsurers should also consider court rulings that may impact on the way claims\nmade contracts are interpreted.  \n5.2.6 Claims arising from events that occur during a reporting period and which are settled during that same\nperiod are expenses of that period. In addition, a liability and corresponding expense is recognised for\nreported claims arising from events of the reporting period that have yet to be settled. This involves a\nprocess of estimation that includes assessment of individual claims and past claims experience.  \n5.2.7 When, based on knowledge of the business, IBNR claims are expected to exist, an estimate is made of the\namount of the claims that will arise therefrom. This involves recognition of a liability and corresponding\nexpense for the reporting period. As in the case of reported but unsettled claims, an estimate of the amount  \n-----  of the current claims incurred but not reported is based on past experience and takes into account any\nchanges in circumstances, such as recent catastrophic events that may have occurred during the reporting\nperiod and changes in the volume or mix of insurance contracts underwritten, that may affect the pattern of\nunreported claims.  \n5.2.8 Some insurers use estimations or formulae, related to the amount of outstanding claims and based on the\npast experience of the insurer and the industry, to arrive at an estimate of direct and indirect claims handling\ncosts.  \n5.2.9 Claims expense and the outstanding claims liability are adjusted on the basis of information, including reopened claims, that becomes available after the initial recognition of claims, to enable the insurer to make a\nmore accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of settlement. This is often referred to as claims development.\nAs is the case with other liabilities, the effect of the adjustments to the liability for outstanding claims and to\nclaims expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the information becomes\navailable.  \n5.2.10 Where further information becomes available about reported claims and reveals that the ultimate cost of\nsettling claims has been under-estimated, the upwards adjustment to claims expense and to the liability for\noutstanding claims is often referred to as claims incurred but not enough reported (IBNER claims). Where\nfurther information reveals that the ultimate cost of settling claims has been over-estimated, the adjustment\nis sometimes referred to as negative IBNER claims.  \n5.2.11 Appropriate allowance is made for future claim cost escalation when determining the central estimate of the\npresent value of the expected future payments. Future claims payments may increase over current levels as\na result of wage or price inflation, and as a result of superimposed inflation (cost increases) due to court\nawards, environmental factors or economic or other causes.  \n5.2.12 With inwards reinsurance claims the reinsurer will receive periodic advices from each cedant. These may\ninclude aggregate information relating to the claims liability. The reinsurer measures its outstanding claims\nliability on the basis of this information and its past experience of the claims payments made under\nreinsurance arrangements. The reinsurer also considers market knowledge of losses and other events such\nas hailstorms or earthquakes.",

To secure\nreinsurance cover, the cedant passes on a portion of the premiums received to a reinsurer. This is known as\noutwards reinsurance expense.  \n10.1.2 The cedant accounts for direct insurance and reinsurance transactions on a gross basis, so that the extent and\neffectiveness of the reinsurance arrangements are apparent to the users of the financial statements, and an\nindication of the insurer\u2019s risk management performance is provided to users. The gross amount of\npremiums earned by the cedant during the reporting period is recognised as income because it undertakes to\nindemnify the full amount of the specified losses of those it has insured, regardless of the reinsurance\narrangements. Correspondingly, the cedant recognises the gross amount of claims expense in the reporting\nperiod because it is obliged to meet the full cost of successful claims by those it has insured.  \n10.1.3 Accordingly, premium ceded to reinsurers is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an\nexpense of the cedant on the basis that it is an outgoing incurred in undertaking the business of direct\ninsurance underwriting, and is not to be netted off against premium revenue.  \n10.1.4 Outwards reinsurance expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income consistently with\nthe recognition of reinsurance recoveries under the reinsurance contract. For proportional reinsurance the\nestimate of outwards reinsurance expense is based upon the gross premium of the underlying direct\ninsurance contract. For non-proportional reinsurance the cedant estimates the total claims that are likely to\nbe made under the contract and hence whether it needs to recognise additional outwards reinsurance\nexpense under a minimum and deposit arrangement or whether it needs to recognise reinstatement\npremiums expense.  \n10.1.5 Some reinsurance contracts purchased by a cedant might involve an experience account. Whilst these\ncontracts may require annual renewal, in substance, the contract period is likely to be greater than one year.\nIn estimating the outwards reinsurance expense and reinsurance recoveries to be recognised in the reporting\nperiod the cedant considers the probability-weighted expected cash flows over the expected period of\nindemnity and discounts the cash flows to reflect the time value of money. In determining the discount\nrates to be adopted, an insurer applies the same principles that are used to determine the discount rates for\noutstanding claims liabilities outlined in section 6. In considering all expected cash flows the reinsurer\nconsiders any profit commissions and commission rebates.",

When practicable, an insurer shall also give quantified\ndisclosure of those assumptions;  \n(d) the effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and insurance liabilities,\nshowing separately the effect of each change that has a material effect on the financial statements;\nand  \n(e) reconciliations of changes in insurance liabilities, reinsurance assets and, if any, related deferred\nacquisition costs.  \n-----  17.6.2 In applying paragraph 17.6.1(b), the recognised assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts would\nnormally include:  \n(a) gross outstanding claims liability;  \n(b) reinsurance recoveries receivable arising from the outstanding claims liability;  \n(c) gross unearned premium liability;  \n(d) reinsurance recoveries receivable arising from the unearned premium liability;  \n(e) unexpired risk liability;  \n(f) other reinsurance recoveries receivable;  \n(g) other recoveries receivable;  \n(h) outwards reinsurance expense asset or liability;  \n(i) direct premium revenue receivable;  \n(j) inwards reinsurance premium revenue receivable;  \n(k) deferred acquisition cost asset; and  \n(l) intangible assets relating to acquired insurance contracts.  \n17.6.3 In applying paragraph 17.6.1(b), the recognised income and expenses arising from insurance contracts\nwould normally include:  \n(a) direct premium revenue;  \n(b) inwards reinsurance premium revenue (including retrocessions);  \n(c) reinsurance and other recoveries revenue;  \n(d) direct claims expense;  \n(e) reinsurance claims expense;  \n(f) outwards reinsurance premium expense (including retrocessions);  \n(g) acquisition costs expense; and  \n(h) other underwriting expenses, including claims handling expenses.  \n17.6.4 When an insurer is presenting the disclosures required by paragraphs 17.6.1(c) and 17.6.1(d) the insurer\ndetermines the level and extent of disclosure that is appropriate having regard to its circumstances and the\nqualitative characteristics of financial statements under the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\n(as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards).  \nAusCF17.6.4 Notwithstanding paragraph 17.6.4, in respect of AusCF entities, when an insurer is presenting the\ndisclosures required by paragraphs 17.6.1(c) and 17.6.1(d) the insurer determines the level and\nextent of disclosure that is appropriate having regard to its circumstances and the qualitative\ncharacteristics of financial statements under the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation\n_of Financial Statements (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards)._  \n17.6.5 For an insurer that is involved in a large number of insurance classes, across different jurisdictions,\ndisclosure by class of business is likely to be voluminous and may not be understandable to the user of the\nfinancial statements.

It is expected that for most insurers\ndisclosure at the major business segment level would normally be most appropriate. The insurer may\nbelieve that disclosure of a range of values would be relevant to the users of the financial statements.  \n17.6.6 Some of the assumptions that would normally have the greatest effect on the measurement of the recognised\namounts described in paragraph 17.6.1(b), are discount rates, inflation rates, average weighted term to\nsettlement from the claims reporting date, average claim frequency, average claim size and expense rates.\nThe insurer determines whether these assumptions shall be disclosed given the requirements of paragraphs\n17.6 and 17.6.1.",

The\ndisclosure about claims development shall go back to the period when the earliest\nmaterial claim arose for which there is still uncertainty about the amount and timing of\nthe claims payments, but need not go back more than ten years. An insurer need not\ndisclose this information for claims for which uncertainty about the amount and timing\nof claims payments is typically resolved within one year;  \n(c) information about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk that paragraphs 31-42 of AASB 7\n_Financial Instruments: Disclosures would require if the insurance contracts were within the scope_\nof AASB 7. However:  \n(i) an insurer need not provide the maturity analyses required by paragraphs 39(a) and (b)\nof AASB 7 if it discloses information about the estimated timing of the net cash\noutflows resulting from recognised insurance liabilities instead. This may take the\nform of an analysis, by estimated timing, of the amounts recognised in the statement of\nfinancial position; and  \n(ii) if an insurer uses an alternative method to manage sensitivity to market conditions,\nsuch as an embedded value analysis, it may use that sensitivity analysis to meet the\nrequirement in paragraph 40(a) of AASB 7. Such an insurer shall also provide the\ndisclosures required by paragraph 41 of AASB 7; and  \n(d) information about exposures to market risk arising from embedded derivatives contained in a host\ninsurance contract if the insurer is not required to, and does not, measure the embedded\nderivatives at fair value.  \n17.7.2 For an insurer that is involved in a large number of insurance classes, across different jurisdictions,\ndisclosure by class of business is likely to be voluminous and may not be understandable to the user of the\nfinancial statements. Furthermore, for such an insurer disclosure for the entity as a whole would normally\nbe at too high a level of aggregation to be relevant or comparable. It is expected that for most insurers\ndisclosure at the major business segment level would normally be most appropriate.  \n17.7.3 The claims development disclosure required by paragraph 17.7.1(b)(iii) only applies to classes of business\nwhere claims are not typically resolved within one year. The insurer, in disclosing claims development,\nensures it is clear to the reader of the financial statements, which classes of business, or which segments of\nthe business, are covered by the disclosures and which classes of business, or which segments of the\nbusiness, are not covered by the disclosures.  \n17.7.4 IG Example 5 in the Guidance on Implementing IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, provides one possible format\nto meet the claims development disclosure requirements of this Standard. Such a format may be\nparticularly appropriate for longer tail classes of business where the long tail nature of the claims is a\nsignificant aspect in the development of the claims, as this format illustrates the development of claims over\na number of years. If this format is adopted, disclosure by accident year, gross and net of reinsurance, of\nundiscounted claims would normally be most relevant to the users of financial statements. The insurer\nexplains the information presented. This includes whether the claims are discounted or undiscounted, gross\nor net of reinsurance and by accident year or underwriting year.  \n17.7.5 To comply with paragraph 17.7.1(b)(i), an insurer shall disclose either (a) or (b) as follows:  \n(a) a sensitivity analysis that shows how profit or loss and equity would have been affected had\nchanges in the relevant risk variable that were reasonably possible at the end of the reporting\nperiod occurred; the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis; and any\nchanges from the previous period in the methods and assumptions used. However, if an insurer\nuses an alternative method to manage sensitivity to market conditions, such as an embedded value\nanalysis, it may meet this requirement by disclosing that alternative sensitivity analysis and the\ndisclosures required by paragraph 41 of AASB 7; and  \n-----  (b) qualitative information about sensitivity, and information about those terms and conditions of\ninsurance contracts that have a material effect on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the\ninsurer\u2019s future cash flows.",

Accordingly, at least one of the following is\nuncertain at the inception of an insurance contract:  \n(a) whether an insured event will occur;  \n(b) when it will occur; or  \n(c) how much the insurer will need to pay if it occurs.  \n3 In some insurance contracts, the insured event is the discovery of a loss during the term of the contract,\neven if the loss arises from an event that occurred before the inception of the contract. In other insurance\ncontracts, the insured event is an event that occurs during the term of the contract, even if the resulting loss\nis discovered after the end of the contract term.  \n4 Some insurance contracts cover events that have already occurred, but whose financial effect is still\nuncertain. An example is a reinsurance contract that covers the direct insurer against adverse development\nof claims already reported by policyholders. In such contracts, the insured event is the discovery of the\nultimate cost of those claims.",

An example is when the insurer\nreplaces a stolen article directly, instead of reimbursing the policyholder. Another example is when an\ninsurer uses its own hospitals and medical staff to provide medical services covered by the contracts.  \n6 Some fixed-fee service contracts in which the level of service depends on an uncertain event meet the\ndefinition of an insurance contract in this Standard but are not regulated as insurance contracts in some\ncountries. One example is a maintenance contract in which the service provider agrees to repair specified\nequipment after a malfunction. The fixed service fee is based on the expected number of malfunctions, but\nit is uncertain whether a particular machine will break down. The malfunction of the equipment adversely\naffects its owner and the contract compensates the owner (in kind, rather than cash). Another example is a\ncontract for car breakdown services in which the provider agrees, for a fixed annual fee, to provide roadside\nassistance or tow the car to a nearby garage. The latter contract could meet the definition of an insurance\ncontract even if the provider does not agree to carry out repairs or replace parts.",

        "page_content=": "## Distinction between Insurance Risk and Other Risks  \n7 The definition of an insurance contract refers to insurance risk, which this Standard defines as risk, other\nthan financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the issuer. A contract that exposes the issuer\nto financial risk without significant insurance risk is not an insurance contract.  \n8 The definition of financial risk in section 19 of the Standard includes a list of financial and non-financial\nvariables. That list includes non-financial variables that are not specific to a party to the contract, such as\nan index of earthquake losses in a particular region or an index of temperatures in a particular city. It\nexcludes non-financial variables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non  \n-----  occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of that party. Furthermore, the risk of changes in the\nfair value of a non-financial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects not only changes in market\nprices for such assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a\nparty to a contract (a non-financial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific\ncar exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car\u2019s physical condition, that risk is insurance risk,\nnot financial risk.  \n9 Some contracts expose the issuer to financial risk, in addition to significant insurance risk. For example,\nmany life insurance contracts both guarantee a minimum rate of return to policyholders (creating financial\nrisk) and promise death benefits that at some times significantly exceed the policyholder\u2019s account balance\n(creating insurance risk in the form of mortality risk). Such contracts are insurance contracts.  \n10 Under some contracts, an insured event triggers the payment of an amount linked to a price index. Such\ncontracts are insurance contracts, provided the payment that is contingent on the insured event can be\nsignificant. The link to the price index is an embedded derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk. If the\nresulting transfer of insurance risk is significant, the embedded derivative meets the definition of an\ninsurance contract, in which case it need not be separated and measured at fair value (see paragraph 2.3.1 of\nthis Standard).  \n11 The definition of insurance risk refers to risk that the insurer accepts from the policyholder. In other words,\ninsurance risk is a pre-existing risk transferred from the policyholder to the insurer. Thus, a new risk\ncreated by the contract is not insurance risk.  \n12 The definition of an insurance contract refers to an adverse effect on the policyholder. The definition does\nnot limit the payment by the insurer to an amount equal to the financial impact of the adverse event. For\nexample, the definition does not exclude \u2018new-for-old\u2019 coverage that pays the policyholder sufficient to\npermit replacement of a damaged old asset by a new asset.  \n13 Some contracts require a payment if a specified uncertain event occurs, but do not require an adverse effect\non the policyholder as a precondition for payment. Such a contract is not an insurance contract even if the\nholder uses the contract to mitigate an underlying risk exposure. For example, if the holder uses a\nderivative to hedge an underlying non financial variable that is correlated with cash flows from an asset of\nthe entity, the derivative is not an insurance contract because payment is not conditional on whether the\nholder is adversely affected by a reduction in the cash flows from the asset. Conversely, the definition of an\ninsurance contract refers to an uncertain event for which an adverse effect on the policyholder is a\ncontractual precondition for payment. This contractual precondition does not require the insurer to\ninvestigate whether the event actually caused an adverse effect, but permits the insurer to deny payment if it\nis not satisfied that the event caused an adverse effect.  \n14 Lapse or persistency risk (i.e. the risk that the counterparty will cancel the contract earlier or later than the\nissuer had expected in pricing the contract) is not insurance risk because the payment to the counterparty is\nnot contingent on an uncertain future event that adversely affects the counterparty. Similarly, expense risk\n(i.e. the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract,\nrather than in costs associated with insured events) is not insurance risk because an unexpected increase in\nexpenses does not adversely affect the counterparty.  \n15 Therefore, a contract that exposes the issuer to lapse risk, persistency risk or expense risk is not an\ninsurance contract unless it also exposes the issuer to insurance risk. However, if the issuer of that contract\nmitigates that risk by using a second contract to transfer part of that risk to another party, the second\ncontract exposes that other party to insurance risk.  \n16 An insurer can accept significant insurance risk from the policyholder only if the insurer is an entity\nseparate from the policyholder. In the case of a mutual insurer, the mutual accepts risk from each\npolicyholder and pools that risk. Although policyholders bear that pooled risk collectively in their capacity\nas owners, the mutual has still accepted the risk that is the essence of an insurance contract.",

        "page_content=": "## Examples of General Insurance Contracts  \n17 The following are examples of contracts that are general insurance contracts, if the transfer of insurance risk\nis significant:  \n(a) insurance against theft or damage to property;  \n(b) insurance against product liability, professional liability, civil liability or legal expenses;  \n(c) medical cover;  \n(d) surety bonds, fidelity bonds, performance bonds and bid bonds (i.e. contracts that provide\ncompensation if another party fails to perform a contractual obligation, for example an obligation\nto construct a building);  \n-----  (e) credit insurance that provides for specified payments to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss\nit incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or\nmodified terms of a debt instrument. These contracts could have various legal forms, such as that\nof a guarantee, some types of letter of credit, a credit derivative default contract or an insurance\ncontract. However, although these contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract, they\nalso meet the definition of a financial guarantee contract in AASB 9 and are within the scope of\nAASB 7 and AASB 9, not this Standard (see paragraph 2.2(f)). Nevertheless, if an issuer of\nfinancial guarantee contracts has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such contracts as\ninsurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts, the issuer may\nelect to apply either AASB 9 and AASB 7 or this Standard to such financial guarantee contracts;  \n(f) product warranties. Product warranties issued by another party for goods sold by a manufacturer,\ndealer or retailer are within the scope of this Standard. However, product warranties issued\ndirectly by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer are outside its scope, because they are within the\nscope of AASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ and AASB 137 _Provisions,_\n_Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets;_  \n(g) title insurance (i.e. insurance against the discovery of defects in title to land that were not\napparent when the insurance contract was written). In this case, the insured event is the discovery\nof a defect in the title, not the defect itself;  \n(h) travel assistance (i.e. compensation in cash or in kind to policyholders for losses suffered while\nthey are travelling). Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Appendix discuss some contracts of this kind;  \n(i) catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both if a specified\nevent adversely affects the issuer of the bond (unless the specified event does not create\nsignificant insurance risk, for example if the event is a change in an interest rate or foreign\nexchange rate);  \n(j) insurance swaps and other contracts that require a payment based on changes in climatic,\ngeological or other physical variables that are specific to a party to the contract; and  \n(k) reinsurance contracts.  \n18 The following are examples of items that are not general insurance contracts:  \n(a) contracts that have the legal form of insurance, but pass all significant insurance risk back to the\npolicyholder through non-cancellable and enforceable mechanisms that adjust future payments by\nthe policyholder as a direct result of insured losses, for example some financial reinsurance\ncontracts or some group contracts (such contracts are normally non-insurance _financial_\n_instruments or service contracts, see paragraphs 19 and 20 of this Appendix);_  \n(b) self-insurance, in other words retaining a risk that could have been covered by insurance (there is\nno insurance contract because there is no agreement with another party);  \n(c) contracts (such as gambling contracts) that require a payment if a specified uncertain future event\noccurs, but do not require, as a contractual precondition for payment, that the event adversely\naffects the policyholder. However, this does not preclude the specification of a predetermined\npayout to quantify the loss caused by a specified event such as an accident;  \n(d) derivatives that expose one party to financial risk but not insurance risk, because they require that\nparty to make payment based solely on changes in one or more of a specified interest rate,\nfinancial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit\nrating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the\nvariable is not specific to a party to the contract (see AASB 9 for derivative assets and AASB 9\nfor derivative liabilities);  \n(e) a credit-related guarantee (or letter of credit, credit derivative default contract or credit insurance\ncontract) that requires payments even if the holder has not incurred a loss on the failure of the\ndebtor to make payments when due (see AASB 9);  \n(f) contracts that require a payment based on a climatic, geological or other physical variable that is\nnot specific to a party to the contract (commonly described as weather derivatives);  \n(g) catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, based on a\nclimatic, geological or other physical variable that is not specific to a party to the contract; and  \n(h) life insurance contracts.  \n19 If the contracts described in paragraph 18 of this Appendix create financial assets or financial liabilities,\nthey are within the scope of AASB 9. Among other things, this means that the parties to the contract use\nwhat is sometimes called deposit accounting, which involves the following:  \n-----  (a) one party recognises the consideration received as a financial liability, rather than as revenue; and  \n(b) the other party recognises the consideration paid as a financial asset, rather than as an expense.  \n20 If the contracts described in paragraph 18 of this Appendix do not create financial assets or financial\nliabilities, AASB 15 applies. Under AASB 15, revenue is recognised when (or as) an entity satisfies a\nperformance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled.",

        "page_content=": "## Significant Insurance Risk  \n21 A contract is an insurance contract only if it transfers significant insurance risk. Paragraphs 7 to 20 of this\nAppendix discuss insurance risk. The following paragraphs discuss the assessment of whether insurance\nrisk is significant.  \n22 Insurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant\nadditional benefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance (i.e. have no\ndiscernible effect on the economics of the transaction). If significant additional benefits would be payable\nin scenarios that have commercial substance, the condition in the previous sentence may be met even if the\ninsured event is extremely unlikely or even if the expected (i.e. probability-weighted) present value of\ncontingent cash flows is a small proportion of the expected present value of all the remaining contractual\ncash flows.  \n23 The additional benefits described in paragraph 22 of this Appendix refer to amounts that exceed those that\nwould be payable if no insured event occurred (excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance). Those\nadditional amounts include claims handling and claims assessment costs, but exclude:  \n(a) the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future services;  \n(b) a payment conditional on an event that does not cause a significant loss to the holder of the\ncontract. For example, consider a contract that requires the issuer to pay one million currency\nunits if an asset suffers physical damage causing an insignificant economic loss of one currency\nunit to the holder. In this contract, the holder transfers to the insurer the insignificant risk of\nlosing one currency unit. At the same time, the contract creates non-insurance risk that the issuer\nwill need to pay 999,999 currency units if the specified event occurs. Because the issuer does not\naccept significant insurance risk from the holder, this contract is not an insurance contract; and  \n(c) possible reinsurance recoveries. The insurer accounts for these separately.  \n24 An insurer shall assess the significance of insurance risk contract by contract, rather than by reference to\nmateriality to the financial statements[1]. Thus, insurance risk may be significant even if there is a minimal\nprobability of material losses for a whole book of contracts. This contract-by-contract assessment makes it\neasier to classify a contract as an insurance contract. However, if a relatively homogeneous book of small\ncontracts is known to consist of contracts that all transfer insurance risk, an insurer need not examine each\ncontract within that book to identify a few non-derivative contracts that transfer insignificant insurance risk.  \n25 Paragraph 22 of this Appendix refers to additional benefits. These additional benefits could include a\nrequirement to pay benefits earlier if the insured event occurs earlier and the payment is not adjusted for the\ntime value of money.  \n26 If an insurance contract is unbundled into a deposit component and an insurance component, the\nsignificance of insurance risk transfer is assessed by reference to the insurance component. The\nsignificance of insurance risk transferred by an embedded derivative is assessed by reference to the\nembedded derivative.",
