Government assistance for the purpose of**\n**this Standard does not include benefits provided only indirectly through action affecting general**\n**trading conditions, such as the provision of infrastructure in development areas or the imposition of**\n**trading constraints on competitors.**  \n**_Government grants are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an entity in_**\n**return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the**\n**entity. They exclude those forms of government assistance which cannot reasonably have a value**\n**placed upon them and transactions with government which cannot be distinguished from the normal**\n**trading transactions of the entity.[2]**  \n**_Grants related to assets are government grants whose primary condition is that an entity qualifying_**\n**for them should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire long-term assets. Subsidiary conditions**  \n1 As part of AASB 2008-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Annual Improvements Project issued in July  \n2008 the Board amended terminology used in this Standard to be consistent with other Australian Accounting Standards as follows: (a)\n\u2018taxable income\u2019 was amended to \u2018taxable profit or tax loss\u2019, (b) \u2018recognised as income/expense\u2019 was amended to \u2018recognised in profit\nor loss\u2019, (c) \u2018credited directly to shareholders\u2019 interests/equity\u2019 was amended to \u2018recognised outside profit or loss\u2019, and (d) \u2018revision to\nan accounting estimate\u2019 was amended to \u2018change in accounting estimate\u2019.  \n2 See also Interpretation 110 _Government Assistance\u2014No Specific Relation to Operating Activities, as identified in AASB 1048_\n_Interpretation of Standards._  \n-----  **may also be attached restricting the type or location of the assets or the periods during which they are**\n**to be acquired or held.**  \n**_Grants related to income are government grants other than those related to assets._**  \n**_Forgivable loans are loans which the lender undertakes to waive repayment of under certain_**\n**prescribed conditions.**  \n**_Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an_**\n**orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. (See AASB 13 Fair Value**\n**_Measurement.)_**  \n4 Government assistance takes many forms varying both in the nature of the assistance given and in the\nconditions which are usually attached to it. The purpose of the assistance may be to encourage an entity to\nembark on a course of action which it would not normally have taken if the assistance was not provided.  \n5 The receipt of government assistance by an entity may be significant for the preparation of the financial\nstatements for two reasons. Firstly, if resources have been transferred, an appropriate method of accounting\nfor the transfer must be found. Secondly, it is desirable to give an indication of the extent to which the entity\nhas benefited from such assistance during the reporting period. This facilitates comparison of an entity\u2019s\nfinancial statements with those of prior periods and with those of other entities.  \n6 Government grants are sometimes called by other names such as subsidies, subventions, or premiums.",

Receipt of a grant does not of itself provide\nconclusive evidence that the conditions attaching to the grant have been or will be fulfilled.  \n9 The manner in which a grant is received does not affect the accounting method to be adopted in regard to\nthe grant. Thus a grant is accounted for in the same manner whether it is received in cash or as a reduction\nof a liability to the government.  \n10 A forgivable loan from government is treated as a government grant when there is reasonable assurance that\nthe entity will meet the terms for forgiveness of the loan.  \n10A The benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant. The\nloan shall be recognised and measured in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments. The benefit of\nthe below-market rate of interest shall be measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of\nthe loan determined in accordance with AASB 9 and the proceeds received. The benefit is accounted for in\naccordance with this Standard. The entity shall consider the conditions and obligations that have been, or\nmust be, met when identifying the costs for which the benefit of the loan is intended to compensate.  \n11 Once a government grant is recognised, any related contingent liability or contingent asset is treated in\naccordance with AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.  \n**12** **Government grants shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in**\n**which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to**\n**compensate.**  \n13 There are two broad approaches to the accounting for government grants: the capital approach, under which\na grant is recognised outside profit or loss, and the income approach, under which a grant is recognised in\nprofit or loss over one or more periods.  \n14 Those in support of the capital approach argue as follows:  \n(a) government grants are a financing device and should be dealt with as such in the statement of\nfinancial position rather than be recognised in profit or loss to offset the items of expense that\nthey finance. Because no repayment is expected, such grants should be recognised outside profit\nor loss.  \n(b) it is inappropriate to recognise government grants in profit or loss, because they are not earned\nbut represent an incentive provided by government without related costs.  \n-----  15 Arguments in support of the income approach are as follows:  \n(a) because government grants are receipts from a source other than shareholders, they should not be\nrecognised directly in equity but should be recognised in profit or loss in appropriate periods.  \n(b) government grants are rarely gratuitous. The entity earns them through compliance with their\nconditions and meeting the envisaged obligations. They should therefore be recognised in profit\nor loss over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the\ngrant is intended to compensate.  \n(c) because income and other taxes are expenses, it is logical to deal also with government grants,\nwhich are an extension of fiscal policies, in profit or loss.  \n16 It is fundamental to the income approach that government grants should be recognised in profit or loss on a\nsystematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the\ngrant is intended to compensate. Recognition of government grants in profit or loss on a receipts basis is not\nin accordance with the accrual accounting assumption (see AASB 101 _Presentation of Financial_\n_Statements) and would be acceptable only if no basis existed for allocating a grant to periods other than the_\none in which it was received.  \n17 In most cases the periods over which an entity recognises the costs or expenses related to a government\ngrant are readily ascertainable. Thus grants in recognition of specific expenses are recognised in profit or\nloss in the same period as the relevant expenses. Similarly, grants related to depreciable assets are usually\nrecognised in profit or loss over the periods and in the proportions in which depreciation expense on those\nassets is recognised.  \n18 Grants related to non-depreciable assets may also require the fulfilment of certain obligations and would\nthen be recognised in profit or loss over the periods that bear the cost of meeting the obligations. As an\nexample, a grant of land may be conditional upon the erection of a building on the site and it may be\nappropriate to recognise the grant in profit or loss over the life of the building.  \n19 Grants are sometimes received as part of a package of financial or fiscal aids to which a number of\nconditions are attached. In such cases, care is needed in identifying the conditions giving rise to costs and\nexpenses which determine the periods over which the grant will be earned. It may be appropriate to allocate\npart of a grant on one basis and part on another.  \n**20** **A government grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred**\n**or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the entity with no future related costs**\n**shall be recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable.**  \n21 In some circumstances, a government grant may be awarded for the purpose of giving immediate financial\nsupport to an entity rather than as an incentive to undertake specific expenditures. Such grants may be\nconfined to a particular entity and may not be available to a whole class of beneficiaries. These\ncircumstances may warrant recognising a grant in profit or loss of the period in which the entity qualifies to\nreceive it, with disclosure to ensure that its effect is clearly understood.  \n22 A government grant may become receivable by an entity as compensation for expenses or losses incurred in\na previous period. Such a grant is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable,\nwith disclosure to ensure that its effect is clearly understood.",

The grant is recognised\nin profit or loss over the life of a depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense.  \n28 The purchase of assets and the receipt of related grants can cause major movements in the cash flow of an\nentity. For this reason and in order to show the gross investment in assets, such movements are often\ndisclosed as separate items in the statement of cash flows regardless of whether or not the grant is deducted\nfrom the related asset for presentation purposes in the statement of financial position.",
