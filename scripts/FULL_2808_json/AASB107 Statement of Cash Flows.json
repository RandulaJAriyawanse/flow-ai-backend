Cash flow information is useful in assessing the\nability of the entity to generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop models to assess and\ncompare the present value of the future cash flows of different entities.

For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent it must be readily\nconvertible to a known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nTherefore, an investment normally qualifies as a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of, say,\nthree months or less from the date of acquisition. Equity investments are excluded from cash equivalents\nunless they are, in substance, cash equivalents, for example in the case of preferred shares acquired within a\nshort period of their maturity and with a specified redemption date.  \n8 Bank borrowings are generally considered to be financing activities. However, in some countries, bank\noverdrafts which are repayable on demand form an integral part of an entity\u2019s cash management. In these\ncircumstances, bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents. A characteristic\nof such banking arrangements is that the bank balance often fluctuates from being positive to overdrawn.  \n9 Cash flows exclude movements between items that constitute cash or cash equivalents because these\ncomponents are part of the cash management of an entity rather than part of its operating, investing and\nfinancing activities. Cash management includes the investment of excess cash in cash equivalents.",

Classification by activity provides information that allows users to assess\nthe impact of those activities on the financial position of the entity and the amount of its cash and cash\nequivalents. This information may also be used to evaluate the relationships among those activities.  \n12 A single transaction may include cash flows that are classified differently.

Information about the specific components of historical operating cash flows is useful, in\nconjunction with other information, in forecasting future operating cash flows.  \n14 Cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from the principal revenue-producing activities\nof the entity. Therefore, they generally result from the transactions and other events that enter into the\ndetermination of profit or loss. Examples of cash flows from operating activities are:  \n(a) cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services;  \n(b) cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue;  \n(c) cash payments to suppliers for goods and services;  \n(d) cash payments to and on behalf of employees;  \n(e) [deleted]  \n-----  (f) cash payments or refunds of income taxes unless they can be specifically identified with\nfinancing and investing activities; and  \n(g) cash receipts and payments from contracts held for dealing or trading purposes.  \nSome transactions, such as the sale of an item of plant, may give rise to a gain or loss that is included in\nrecognised profit or loss. The cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows from investing\nactivities. However, cash payments to manufacture or acquire assets held for rental to others and\nsubsequently held for sale as described in paragraph 68A of AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment are\ncash flows from operating activities. The cash receipts from rents and subsequent sales of such assets are\nalso cash flows from operating activities.  \n15 An entity may hold securities and loans for dealing or trading purposes, in which case they are similar to\ninventory acquired specifically for resale. Therefore, cash flows arising from the purchase and sale of\ndealing or trading securities are classified as operating activities. Similarly, cash advances and loans made\nby financial institutions are usually classified as operating activities since they relate to the main revenueproducing activity of that entity.",

For example, a weighted average exchange rate for a period may be used for recording\nforeign currency transactions or the translation of the cash flows of a foreign subsidiary. However,\nAASB 121 does not permit use of the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period when translating the\ncash flows of a foreign subsidiary.  \n28 Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not cash flows.\nHowever, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign\ncurrency is reported in the statement of cash flows in order to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at the\nbeginning and the end of the period. This amount is presented separately from cash flows from operating,\ninvesting and financing activities and includes the differences, if any, had those cash flows been reported at\nend of period exchange rates.  \n29 [Deleted]  \n30 [Deleted]",
