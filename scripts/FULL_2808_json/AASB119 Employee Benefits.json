Informal practices give rise\nto a constructive obligation where the entity has no realistic alternative but to pay employee\nbenefits. An example of a constructive obligation is where a change in the entity\u2019s informal\npractices would cause unacceptable damage to its relationship with employees.  \n5 Employee benefits include:  \n(a) short-term employee benefits, such as the following, if expected to be settled wholly before\ntwelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the\nrelated services:  \n(i) wages, salaries and social security contributions;  \n(ii) paid annual leave and paid sick leave;  \n-----  (iii) profit-sharing and bonuses; and  \n(iv) non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised\ngoods or services) for current employees;  \n(b) post-employment benefits, such as the following:  \n(i) retirement benefits (eg pensions and lump sum payments on retirement); and  \n(ii) other post-employment benefits, such as post-employment life insurance and postemployment medical care;  \n(c) other long-term employee benefits, such as the following:  \n(i) long-term paid absences such as long-service leave or sabbatical leave;  \n(ii) jubilee or other long-service benefits; and  \n(iii) long-term disability benefits; and  \n(d) termination benefits.  \n6 Employee benefits include benefits provided either to employees or to their dependants or beneficiaries and\nmay be settled by payments (or the provision of goods or services) made either directly to the employees, to\ntheir spouses, children or other dependants or to others, such as insurance companies.  \n7 An employee may provide services to an entity on a full-time, part-time, permanent, casual or temporary\nbasis.

An\nentity applies this Standard to all such arrangements whether or not they involve the establishment of a\nseparate entity to receive contributions and to pay benefits.  \n27 Post-employment benefit plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans,\ndepending on the economic substance of the plan as derived from its principal terms and conditions.  \n28 Under defined contribution plans the entity\u2019s legal or constructive obligation is limited to the amount that it\nagrees to contribute to the fund. Thus, the amount of the post-employment benefits received by the\nemployee is determined by the amount of contributions paid by an entity (and perhaps also the employee) to\na post-employment benefit plan or to an insurance company, together with investment returns arising from\nthe contributions. In consequence, actuarial risk (that benefits will be less than expected) and investment\nrisk (that assets invested will be insufficient to meet expected benefits) fall, in substance, on the employee.  \n29 Examples of cases where an entity\u2019s obligation is not limited to the amount that it agrees to contribute to the\nfund are when the entity has a legal or constructive obligation through:  \n(a) a plan benefit formula that is not linked solely to the amount of contributions and requires the\nentity to provide further contributions if assets are insufficient to meet the benefits in the plan\nbenefit formula;  \n(b) a guarantee, either indirectly through a plan or directly, of a specified return on contributions; or  \n(c) those informal practices that give rise to a constructive obligation. For example, a constructive\nobligation may arise where an entity has a history of increasing benefits for former employees to\nkeep pace with inflation even where there is no legal obligation to do so.  \n30 Under defined benefit plans:  \n(a) the entity\u2019s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees; and  \n(b) actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance,\non the entity. If actuarial or investment experience are worse than expected, the entity\u2019s\nobligation may be increased.  \n31 Paragraphs 32\u201349 explain the distinction between defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans in\nthe context of multi-employer plans, defined benefit plans that share risks between entities under common\ncontrol, state plans and insured benefits.",

This\nrequires an entity to determine how much benefit is attributable to the current and prior\nperiods (see paragraphs 70\u201374) and to make estimates (actuarial assumptions) about\ndemographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial\nvariables (such as future increases in salaries and medical costs) that will affect the cost\nof the benefit (see paragraphs 75\u201398).  \n-----  (ii) discounting that benefit in order to determine the present value of the defined benefit\nobligation and the current service cost (see paragraphs 67\u201369 and 83\u201386).  \n(iii) deducting the fair value of any plan assets (see paragraphs 113\u2013115) from the present\nvalue of the defined benefit obligation.  \n(b) determining the amount of the net defined benefit liability (asset) as the amount of the deficit or\nsurplus determined in (a), adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the\nasset ceiling (see paragraph 64).  \n(c) determining amounts to be recognised in profit or loss:  \n(i) current service cost (see paragraphs 70\u201374 and paragraph 122A).  \n(ii) any past service cost and gain or loss on settlement (see paragraphs 99\u2013112).  \n(iii) net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) (see paragraphs 123\u2013126).  \n(d) determining the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset), to be recognised in\nother comprehensive income, comprising:  \n(i) actuarial gains and losses (see paragraphs 128 and 129);  \n(ii) return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined\nbenefit liability (asset) (see paragraph 130); and  \n(iii) any change in the effect of the asset ceiling (see paragraph 64), excluding amounts\nincluded in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).  \nWhere an entity has more than one defined benefit plan, the entity applies these procedures for\neach material plan separately.  \n**58** **An entity shall determine the net defined benefit liability (asset) with sufficient regularity that the**\n**amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from the amounts that would**\n**be determined at the end of the reporting period.**  \n59 This Standard encourages, but does not require, an entity to involve a qualified actuary in the measurement\nof all material post-employment benefit obligations. For practical reasons, an entity may request a qualified\nactuary to carry out a detailed valuation of the obligation before the end of the reporting period.\nNevertheless, the results of that valuation are updated for any material transactions and other material\nchanges in circumstances (including changes in market prices and interest rates) up to the end of the\nreporting period.  \n60 In some cases, estimates, averages and computational short cuts may provide a reliable approximation of\nthe detailed computations illustrated in this Standard.",

The total present value of a defined benefit\nobligation is unlikely to be particularly sensitive to the discount rate applied to the portion of benefits that is\npayable beyond the final maturity of the available corporate or government bonds.",

This is the case if,\nfor example:  \n(a) the entity has a history of increasing benefits, for example, to mitigate the effects of inflation, and\nthere is no indication that this practice will change in the future;  \n(b) the entity is obliged, by either the formal terms of a plan (or a constructive obligation that goes\nbeyond those terms) or legislation, to use any surplus in the plan for the benefit of plan\nparticipants (see paragraph 108(c)); or  \n(c) benefits vary in response to a performance target or other criteria. For example, the terms of the\nplan may state that it will pay reduced benefits or require additional contributions from\nemployees if the plan assets are insufficient. The measurement of the obligation reflects the best\nestimate of the effect of the performance target or other criteria.  \n89 Actuarial assumptions do not reflect future benefit changes that are not set out in the formal terms of the\nplan (or a constructive obligation) at the end of the reporting period. Such changes will result in:  \n(a) past service cost, to the extent that they change benefits for service before the change; and  \n(b) current service cost for periods after the change, to the extent that they change benefits for service\nafter the change.  \n90 Estimates of future salary increases take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant\nfactors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.  \n91 Some defined benefit plans limit the contributions that an entity is required to pay. The ultimate cost of the\nbenefits takes account of the effect of a limit on contributions. The effect of a limit on contributions is\ndetermined over the shorter of:  \n(a) the estimated life of the entity; and  \n(b) the estimated life of the plan.  \n92 Some defined benefit plans require employees or third parties to contribute to the cost of the plan.\nContributions by employees reduce the cost of the benefits to the entity. An entity considers whether thirdparty contributions reduce the cost of the benefits to the entity, or are a reimbursement right as described in\nparagraph 116. Contributions by employees or third parties are either set out in the formal terms of the plan\n(or arise from a constructive obligation that goes beyond those terms), or are discretionary. Discretionary\ncontributions by employees or third parties reduce service cost upon payment of these contributions to the\nplan.  \n93 Contributions from employees or third parties set out in the formal terms of the plan either reduce service\ncost (if they are linked to service), or affect remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) (if\nthey are not linked to service). An example of contributions that are not linked to service is when the\ncontributions are required to reduce a deficit arising from losses on plan assets or from actuarial losses. If\ncontributions from employees or third parties are linked to service, those contributions reduce the service\ncost as follows:  \n(a) if the amount of the contributions is dependent on the number of years of service, an entity shall\nattribute the contributions to periods of service using the same attribution method required by\nparagraph 70 for the gross benefit (ie either using the plan\u2019s contribution formula or on a straightline basis); or  \n(b) if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, the entity is\npermitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction of the service cost in the period in which\nthe related service is rendered. Examples of contributions that are independent of the number of\nyears of service include those that are a fixed percentage of the employee\u2019s salary, a fixed amount\nthroughout the service period or dependent on the employee\u2019s age.  \nParagraph A1 provides related application guidance.  \n94 For contributions from employees or third parties that are attributed to periods of service in accordance with\nparagraph 93(a), changes in the contributions result in:  \n-----  (a) current and past service cost (if those changes are not set out in the formal terms of a plan and do\nnot arise from a constructive obligation); or  \n(b) actuarial gains and losses (if those changes are set out in the formal terms of a plan, or arise from\na constructive obligation).  \n95 Some post-employment benefits are linked to variables such as the level of state retirement benefits or state\nmedical care. The measurement of such benefits reflects the best estimate of such variables, based on\nhistorical data and other reliable evidence.  \n**96** **Assumptions about medical costs shall take account of estimated future changes in the cost of medical**\n**services, resulting from both inflation and specific changes in medical costs.**  \n97 Measurement of post-employment medical benefits requires assumptions about the level and frequency of\nfuture claims and the cost of meeting those claims. An entity estimates future medical costs on the basis of\nhistorical data about the entity\u2019s own experience, supplemented where necessary by historical data from\nother entities, insurance companies, medical providers or other sources. Estimates of future medical costs\nconsider the effect of technological advances, changes in health care utilisation or delivery patterns and\nchanges in the health status of plan participants.  \n98 The level and frequency of claims is particularly sensitive to the age, health status and sex of employees\n(and their dependants) and may be sensitive to other factors such as geographical location. Therefore,\nhistorical data are adjusted to the extent that the demographic mix of the population differs from that of the\npopulation used as a basis for the data. They are also adjusted where there is reliable evidence that historical\ntrends will not continue.",

For example, a one-off transfer of significant employer obligations under the plan to an\ninsurance company through the purchase of an insurance policy is a settlement; a lump sum cash payment,\nunder the terms of the plan, to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified postemployment benefits is not.  \n112 In some cases, an entity acquires an insurance policy to fund some or all of the employee benefits relating to\nemployee service in the current and prior periods.

        "page_content=": "## Termination benefits  \n159 This Standard deals with termination benefits separately from other employee benefits because the event\nthat gives rise to an obligation is the termination of employment rather than employee service. Termination\nbenefits result from either an entity\u2019s decision to terminate the employment or an employee\u2019s decision to\naccept an entity\u2019s offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment.  \n160 Termination benefits do not include employee benefits resulting from termination of employment at the\nrequest of the employee without an entity\u2019s offer, or as a result of mandatory retirement requirements,\nbecause those benefits are post-employment benefits. Some entities provide a lower level of benefit for\ntermination of employment at the request of the employee (in substance, a post-employment benefit) than\nfor termination of employment at the request of the entity. The difference between the benefit provided for\ntermination of employment at the request of the employee and a higher benefit provided at the request of the\nentity is a termination benefit.  \n161 The form of the employee benefit does not determine whether it is provided in exchange for service or in\nexchange for termination of the employee\u2019s employment. Termination benefits are typically lump sum\npayments, but sometimes also include:  \n-----  (a) enhancement of post-employment benefits, either indirectly through an employee benefit plan or\ndirectly.  \n(b) salary until the end of a specified notice period if the employee renders no further service that\nprovides economic benefits to the entity.  \n162 Indicators that an employee benefit is provided in exchange for services include the following:  \n(a) the benefit is conditional on future service being provided (including benefits that increase if\nfurther service is provided).  \n(b) the benefit is provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit plan.  \n163 Some termination benefits are provided in accordance with the terms of an existing employee benefit plan.\nFor example, they may be specified by statute, employment contract or union agreement, or may be implied\nas a result of the employer\u2019s past practice of providing similar benefits. As another example, if an entity\nmakes an offer of benefits available for more than a short period, or there is more than a short period\nbetween the offer and the expected date of actual termination, the entity considers whether it has established\na new employee benefit plan and hence whether the benefits offered under that plan are termination benefits\nor post-employment benefits. Employee benefits provided in accordance with the terms of an employee\nbenefit plan are termination benefits if they both result from an entity\u2019s decision to terminate an employee\u2019s\nemployment and are not conditional on future service being provided.  \n164 Some employee benefits are provided regardless of the reason for the employee\u2019s departure. The payment\nof such benefits is certain (subject to any vesting or minimum service requirements) but the timing of their\npayment is uncertain. Although such benefits are described in some jurisdictions as termination indemnities\nor termination gratuities, they are post-employment benefits rather than termination benefits, and an entity\naccounts for them as post-employment benefits.",

Because the entity needs the\nexpertise of the employees at the factory to complete some contracts, it announces a plan of termination\nas follows.  \nEach employee who stays and renders service until the closure of the factory will receive on the\ntermination date a cash payment of CU30,000. Employees leaving before closure of the factory will\nreceive CU10,000.  \nThere are 120 employees at the factory. At the time of announcing the plan, the entity expects 20 of them\nto leave before closure. Therefore, the total expected cash outflows under the plan are CU3,200,000 (ie\n20 \u00d7 CU10,000 + 100 \u00d7 CU30,000). As required by paragraph 160, the entity accounts for benefits\nprovided in exchange for termination of employment as termination benefits and accounts for benefits\nprovided in exchange for services as short-term employee benefits.  \n_Termination benefits_  \nThe benefit provided in exchange for termination of employment is CU10,000. This is the amount that an\nentity would have to pay for terminating the employment regardless of whether the employees stay and\nrender service until closure of the factory or they leave before closure. Even though the employees can\nleave before closure, the termination of all employees\u2019 employment is a result of the entity\u2019s decision to\nclose the factory and terminate their employment (ie all employees will leave employment when the\nfactory closes). Therefore the entity recognises a liability of CU1,200,000 (ie 120 \u00d7 CU10,000) for the\ntermination benefits provided in accordance with the employee benefit plan at the earlier of when the\nplan of termination is announced and when the entity recognises the restructuring costs associated with\nthe closure of the factory.  \n_Benefits provided in exchange for service_  \nThe incremental benefits that employees will receive if they provide services for the full ten-month\nperiod are in exchange for services provided over that period. The entity accounts for them as short-term\nemployee benefits because the entity expects to settle them before twelve months after the end of the\nannual reporting period. In this example, discounting is not required, so an expense of CU200,000 (ie\nCU2,000,000 \u00f7 10) is recognised in each month during the service period of ten months, with a\ncorresponding increase in the carrying amount of the liability.",
