An entity considers the following factors in determining its functional\ncurrency:  \n(a) the currency:  \n(i) that mainly influences sales prices for goods and services (this will often be the\ncurrency in which sales prices for its goods and services are denominated and settled);\nand  \n(ii) of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sales\nprices of its goods and services.  \n(b) the currency that mainly influences labour, material and other costs of providing goods or\nservices (this will often be the currency in which such costs are denominated and settled).  \n10 The following factors may also provide evidence of an entity\u2019s functional currency:  \n(a) the currency in which funds from financing activities (ie issuing debt and equity instruments) are\ngenerated.  \n(b) the currency in which receipts from operating activities are usually retained.  \n11 The following additional factors are considered in determining the functional currency of a foreign\noperation, and whether its functional currency is the same as that of the reporting entity (the reporting\nentity, in this context, being the entity that has the foreign operation as its subsidiary, branch, associate or\njoint arrangement):  \n-----  (a) whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an extension of the reporting\nentity, rather than being carried out with a significant degree of autonomy. An example of the\nformer is when the foreign operation only sells goods imported from the reporting entity and\nremits the proceeds to it. An example of the latter is when the operation accumulates cash and\nother monetary items, incurs expenses, generates income and arranges borrowings, all\nsubstantially in its local currency.  \n(b) whether transactions with the reporting entity are a high or a low proportion of the foreign\noperation\u2019s activities.  \n(c) whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly affect the cash flows of\nthe reporting entity and are readily available for remittance to it.  \n(d) whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are sufficient to service existing\nand normally expected debt obligations without funds being made available by the reporting\nentity.  \n12 When the above indicators are mixed and the functional currency is not obvious, management uses its\njudgement to determine the functional currency that most faithfully represents the economic effects of the\nunderlying transactions, events and conditions. As part of this approach, management gives priority to the\nprimary indicators in paragraph 9 before considering the indicators in paragraphs 10 and 11, which are\ndesigned to provide additional supporting evidence to determine an entity\u2019s functional currency.  \n13 An entity\u2019s functional currency reflects the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are relevant\nto it. Accordingly, once determined, the functional currency is not changed unless there is a change in those\nunderlying transactions, events and conditions.  \n14 If the functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, the entity\u2019s financial statements\nare restated in accordance with AASB 129 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. An entity\ncannot avoid restatement in accordance with AASB 129 by, for example, adopting as its functional currency\na currency other than the functional currency determined in accordance with this Standard (such as the\nfunctional currency of its parent).",

The entity translates foreign currency items into  \n-----  its functional currency and reports the effects of such translation in accordance with paragraphs 20\u201337 and\n50.  \n18 Many reporting entities comprise a number of individual entities (eg a group is made up of a parent and one\nor more subsidiaries). Various types of entities, whether members of a group or otherwise, may have\ninvestments in associates or joint arrangements. They may also have branches. It is necessary for the results\nand financial position of each individual entity included in the reporting entity to be translated into the\ncurrency in which the reporting entity presents its financial statements. This Standard permits the\npresentation currency of a reporting entity to be any currency (or currencies). The results and financial\nposition of any individual entity within the reporting entity whose functional currency differs from the\npresentation currency are translated in accordance with paragraphs 38\u201350.  \n19 This Standard also permits a stand-alone entity preparing financial statements or an entity preparing\nseparate financial statements in accordance with AASB 127 _Separate Financial Statements to present its_\nfinancial statements in any currency (or currencies).

For practical reasons, a rate that approximates the actual rate at the\ndate of the transaction is often used, for example, an average rate for a week or a month might be used for\nall transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that period.

For example,\nproperty, plant and equipment may be measured in terms of fair value or historical cost in accordance with\nAASB 116 _Property, Plant and Equipment. Whether the carrying amount is determined on the basis of_\nhistorical cost or on the basis of fair value, if the amount is determined in a foreign currency it is then\ntranslated into the functional currency in accordance with this Standard.  \n25 The carrying amount of some items is determined by comparing two or more amounts. For example, the\ncarrying amount of inventories is the lower of cost and net realisable value in accordance with AASB 102\n_Inventories. Similarly, in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets, the carrying amount of an asset_\nfor which there is an indication of impairment is the lower of its carrying amount before considering\npossible impairment losses and its recoverable amount.

If exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking, the rate used is the first subsequent\nrate at which exchanges could be made.",

        "page_content=": "## Recognition of exchange differences  \n27 As noted in paragraphs 3(a) and 5, AASB 9 applies to hedge accounting for foreign currency items. The\napplication of hedge accounting requires an entity to account for some exchange differences differently\nfrom the treatment of exchange differences required by this Standard. For example, AASB 9 requires that\nexchange differences on monetary items that qualify as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge are\nrecognised initially in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.  \n**28** **Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at**\n**rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in**\n**previous financial statements shall be recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise,**\n**except as described in paragraph 32.**  \n29 When monetary items arise from a foreign currency transaction and there is a change in the exchange rate\nbetween the transaction date and the date of settlement, an exchange difference results. When the\ntransaction is settled within the same accounting period as that in which it occurred, all the exchange\ndifference is recognised in that period. However, when the transaction is settled in a subsequent accounting\nperiod, the exchange difference recognised in each period up to the date of settlement is determined by the\nchange in exchange rates during each period.  \n**30** **When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any**\n**exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognised in other comprehensive income.**\n**Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange**\n**component of that gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss.**  \n31 Other Australian Accounting Standards require some gains and losses to be recognised in other\ncomprehensive income. For example, AASB 116 requires some gains and losses arising on a revaluation of\nproperty, plant and equipment to be recognised in other comprehensive income. When such an asset is\nmeasured in a foreign currency, paragraph 23(c) of this Standard requires the revalued amount to be\ntranslated using the rate at the date the value is determined, resulting in an exchange difference that is also\nrecognised in other comprehensive income.  \n**32** **Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity\u2019s net**\n**investment in a foreign operation (see paragraph 15) shall be recognised in profit or loss in the**\n**separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the individual financial statements of the**\n**foreign operation, as appropriate. In the financial statements that include the foreign operation and**\n**the reporting entity (eg consolidated financial statements when the foreign operation is a subsidiary),**\n**such exchange differences shall be recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified**\n**from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment in accordance with paragraph 48.**  \n33 When a monetary item forms part of a reporting entity\u2019s net investment in a foreign operation and is\ndenominated in the functional currency of the reporting entity, an exchange difference arises in the foreign\noperation\u2019s individual financial statements in accordance with paragraph 28. If such an item is denominated\nin the functional currency of the foreign operation, an exchange difference arises in the reporting entity\u2019s\nseparate financial statements in accordance with paragraph 28. If such an item is denominated in a currency\nother than the functional currency of either the reporting entity or the foreign operation, an exchange\ndifference arises in the reporting entity\u2019s separate financial statements and in the foreign operation\u2019s\nindividual financial statements in accordance with paragraph 28. Such exchange differences are recognised\nin other comprehensive income in the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the\nreporting entity (ie financial statements in which the foreign operation is consolidated or accounted for\nusing the equity method).  \n-----  34 When an entity keeps its books and records in a currency other than its functional currency, at the time the\nentity prepares its financial statements all amounts are translated into the functional currency in accordance\nwith paragraphs 20\u201326. This produces the same amounts in the functional currency as would have occurred\nhad the items been recorded initially in the functional currency. For example, monetary items are translated\ninto the functional currency using the closing rate, and non-monetary items that are measured on a historical\ncost basis are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction that resulted in their\nrecognition.",

Accordingly, once the functional currency is determined, it can\nbe changed only if there is a change to those underlying transactions, events and conditions. For example, a\nchange in the currency that mainly influences the sales prices of goods and services may lead to a change in\nan entity\u2019s functional currency.  \n37 The effect of a change in functional currency is accounted for prospectively. In other words, an entity\ntranslates all items into the new functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the change. The\nresulting translated amounts for non-monetary items are treated as their historical cost. Exchange\ndifferences arising from the translation of a foreign operation previously recognised in other comprehensive\nincome in accordance with paragraphs 32 and 39(c) are not reclassified from equity to profit or loss until the\ndisposal of the operation.",

If the presentation currency\ndiffers from the entity\u2019s functional currency, it translates its results and financial position into the\npresentation currency. For example, when a group contains individual entities with different functional\ncurrencies, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in a common currency so that\nconsolidated financial statements may be presented.  \n**39** **The results and financial position of an entity whose functional currency is not the currency of a**\n**hyperinflationary economy shall be translated into a different presentation currency using the**\n**following procedures:**  \n**(a)** **assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (ie including**\n**comparatives) shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial**\n**position;**  \n**(b)** **income and expenses for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive**\n**income (ie including comparatives) shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of the**\n**transactions; and**  \n**(c)** **all resulting exchange differences shall be recognised in other comprehensive income.**  \n40 For practical reasons, a rate that approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions, for\nexample an average rate for the period, is often used to translate income and expense items. However, if\nexchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate.  \n41 The exchange differences referred to in paragraph 39(c) result from:  \n(a) translating income and expenses at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions and assets\nand liabilities at the closing rate.  \n(b) translating the opening net assets at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate.  \nThese exchange differences are not recognised in profit or loss because the changes in exchange rates have\nlittle or no direct effect on the present and future cash flows from operations. The cumulative amount of the\nexchange differences is presented in a separate component of equity until disposal of the foreign operation.\nWhen the exchange differences relate to a foreign operation that is consolidated but not wholly-owned,\naccumulated exchange differences arising from translation and attributable to non-controlling interests are  \n-----  allocated to, and recognised as part of, non-controlling interests in the consolidated statement of financial\nposition.  \n**42** **The results and financial position of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a**\n**hyperinflationary economy shall be translated into a different presentation currency using the**\n**following procedures:**  \n**(a)** **all amounts (ie assets, liabilities, equity items, income and expenses, including comparatives)**\n**shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of the most recent statement of financial**\n**position, except that**  \n**(b)** **when amounts are translated into the currency of a non-hyperinflationary economy,**\n**comparative amounts shall be those that were presented as current year amounts in the**\n**relevant prior year financial statements (ie not adjusted for subsequent changes in the price**\n**level or subsequent changes in exchange rates).**  \n**43** **When an entity\u2019s functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, the entity shall**\n**restate its financial statements in accordance with AASB 129 before applying the translation method**\n**set out in paragraph 42, except for comparative amounts that are translated into a currency of a non-**\n**hyperinflationary economy (see paragraph 42(b)). When the economy ceases to be hyperinflationary**\n**and the entity no longer restates its financial statements in accordance with AASB 129, it shall use as**\n**the historical costs for translation into the presentation currency the amounts restated to the price**\n**level at the date the entity ceased restating its financial statements.**",

        "page_content=": "## Translation of a foreign operation  \n44 Paragraphs 45\u201347, in addition to paragraphs 38\u201343, apply when the results and financial position of a\nforeign operation are translated into a presentation currency so that the foreign operation can be included in\nthe financial statements of the reporting entity by consolidation or the equity method.  \n45 The incorporation of the results and financial position of a foreign operation with those of the reporting\nentity follows normal consolidation procedures, such as the elimination of intragroup balances and\nintragroup transactions of a subsidiary (see AASB 10 _Consolidated Financial Statements). However, an_\nintragroup monetary asset (or liability), whether short-term or long-term, cannot be eliminated against the\ncorresponding intragroup liability (or asset) without showing the results of currency fluctuations in the\nconsolidated financial statements. This is because the monetary item represents a commitment to convert\none currency into another and exposes the reporting entity to a gain or loss through currency fluctuations.\nAccordingly, in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity, such an exchange difference is\nrecognised in profit or loss or, if it arises from the circumstances described in paragraph 32, it is recognised\nin other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the\nforeign operation.  \n46 When the financial statements of a foreign operation are as of a date different from that of the reporting\nentity, the foreign operation often prepares additional statements as of the same date as the reporting\nentity\u2019s financial statements. When this is not done, AASB 10 allows the use of a different date provided\nthat the difference is no greater than three months and adjustments are made for the effects of any\nsignificant transactions or other events that occur between the different dates. In such a case, the assets and\nliabilities of the foreign operation are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period of the\nforeign operation. Adjustments are made for significant changes in exchange rates up to the end of the\nreporting period of the reporting entity in accordance with AASB 10. The same approach is used in\napplying the equity method to associates and joint ventures in accordance with AASB 128.  \n**47** **Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the**\n**carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation shall be**\n**treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation.

An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on\nor after 1 January 2006. Earlier application is encouraged.  \n59 An entity shall apply paragraph 47 prospectively to all acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the\nfinancial reporting period in which this Standard is first applied. Retrospective application of paragraph 47\nto earlier acquisitions is permitted. For an acquisition of a foreign operation treated prospectively but which\noccurred before the date on which this Standard is first applied, the entity shall not restate prior years and\naccordingly may, when appropriate, treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on that acquisition as\nassets and liabilities of the entity rather than as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Therefore,\nthose goodwill and fair value adjustments either are already expressed in the entity\u2019s functional currency or\nare non-monetary foreign currency items, which are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the\nacquisition.  \n60 All other changes resulting from the application of this Standard shall be accounted for in accordance with\nthe requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.  \n60A IAS 1 (as revised in 2007) amended the terminology used throughout IFRSs. In addition it amended\nparagraphs 27, 30\u201333, 37, 39, 41, 45, 48 and 52. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2009. If an entity applies IAS 1 (revised 2007) for an earlier period, the\namendments shall be applied for that earlier period.  \n60D Paragraph 60B was amended by _Improvements to IFRSs issued in May 2010. An entity shall apply that_\namendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. Earlier application is permitted.  \n60F IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, issued in May 2011, amended paragraphs 3(b), 8, 11, 18, 19, 33,\n44\u201346 and 48A. An entity shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.  \n60G IFRS 13, issued in May 2011, amended the definition of fair value in paragraph 8 and amended paragraph\n23. An entity shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 13.  \n60H _Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (Amendments to IAS 1), issued in June 2011,_\namended paragraph 39. An entity shall apply that amendment when it applies IAS 1 as amended in June\n2011.  \n61 This Standard supersedes IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (revised in 1993).  \n62 This Standard supersedes the following Interpretations:  \n(a) SIC-11 _Foreign Exchange\u2014Capitalisation of Losses Resulting from Severe Currency_\n_Devaluations;_  \n(b) SIC-19 _Reporting Currency\u2014Measurement and Presentation of Financial Statements under_\n_IAS 21 and IAS 29; and_  \n(c) SIC-30 Reporting Currency\u2014Translation from Measurement Currency to Presentation Currency.  \n-----  ",
