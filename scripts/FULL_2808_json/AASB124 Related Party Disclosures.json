For example, entities frequently\ncarry on parts of their activities through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. In those circumstances,\nthe entity has the ability to affect the financial and operating policies of the investee through the presence of\ncontrol, joint control or significant influence.  \n-----  6 A related party relationship could have an effect on the profit or loss and financial position of an entity.\nRelated parties may enter into transactions that unrelated parties would not. For example, an entity that sells\ngoods to its parent at cost might not sell on those terms to another customer. Also, transactions between\nrelated parties may not be made at the same amounts as between unrelated parties.  \n7 The profit or loss and financial position of an entity may be affected by a related party relationship even if\nrelated party transactions do not occur. The mere existence of the relationship may be sufficient to affect the\ntransactions of the entity with other parties. For example, a subsidiary may terminate relations with a\ntrading partner on acquisition by the parent of a fellow subsidiary engaged in the same activity as the former\ntrading partner. Alternatively, one party may refrain from acting because of the significant influence of\nanother\u2014for example, a subsidiary may be instructed by its parent not to engage in research and\ndevelopment.  \n8 For these reasons, knowledge of an entity\u2019s transactions, outstanding balances, including commitments, and\nrelationships with related parties may affect assessments of its operations by users of financial statements,\nincluding assessments of the risks and opportunities facing the entity.",

In a public sector context, entities\nshould consider the facts and circumstances, including the terms of the relevant legislative instruments that\ngive rise to the entity, in assessing whether a person is a member of the key management personnel, as\ndefined, of the entity. For example, the facts and circumstances may reflect that not all persons described as\n\u2018senior executive staff\u2019 or \u2018Secretary\u2019 or \u2018Minister\u2019 may be a member of the key management personnel of\nthe entity. Similarly, in relation to a not-for-profit public sector entity, the facts and circumstances may\nreflect that a person\u2019s powers do not give rise to a capacity to direct or control the activities of an entity,\nwhere the powers are only ceremonial or procedural in substance.  \nIG4 Normally, the determination of key management personnel is similar for entities in the public sector and the\nprivate sector. However, ministerial-type roles do not normally arise in a private sector context. A Minister\nwould be a member of the key management personnel of an entity that is within the Minister\u2019s portfolio if\nthe Minister has the \u201cauthority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the\nentity, directly or indirectly\u201d. In some entities or jurisdictions, the responsible Minister may not, in\nsubstance, have such authority and responsibility over the activities of the entity, and consequently would\nnot meet the definition of key management personnel.  \nIG5 A Minister may be a member of the key management personnel of an entity where the Minister\u2019s role and\nresponsibilities result in the Minister forming part of the group of persons tasked with determining the\ndirection of the entity. It would be uncommon for a Minister to be a member of the key management\npersonnel of an entity that is within their portfolio where the entity is not otherwise controlled by the\ngovernment, as the government\u2019s powers and functions (executed by the Minister) in relation to that entity\nwould have formed part of the government\u2019s assessment of whether it controls the entity. Whether a\nMinister is a member of the key management personnel of an entity controlled by the government will\ndepend on the facts and circumstances that apply in each instance, as the determination of the key\nmanagement personnel of an entity is made on an entity by entity basis. Accordingly, a member of the key\nmanagement personnel of the government is not necessarily also a member of the key management\npersonnel of each entity controlled by that government (see also paragraph IG10).  \nIG6 Examples 1\u20136 illustrate application of the definition of key management personnel by not-for-profit public\nsector entities. These examples do not limit the persons who may be key management personnel of a notfor-profit public sector entity to only those roles described.  \n-----  ",

Assistant Ministers are appointed to assist Ministers\nin prioritising work, to provide a training experience for future Ministers, to facilitate public access to the Ministers\nand to enable the bureaucracy to have an ongoing point of contact so that parliamentary correspondence and other\nparliamentary administrative issues are neither overlooked nor downgraded. As an Assistant Minister, Minister B\ncannot:  \n-  sit as a Minister in Cabinet;  \n-  attend a meeting of the Executive Council or sign Executive Council Minutes on behalf of the Minister;  \n-  perform any duties in Parliament on behalf of the Minister including answering questions without notice,\npresenting Ministerial Statements, tabling documents and introducing legislation; or  \n-  appear before a Committee of Parliament on behalf of the Minister.  \nThe Department is responsible for delivering national policies and programs that help Australians access quality early\nchildhood education, school education, higher education, vocational education and training, international education\nand research. The Department is headed by the Secretary of the Department, who reports to the Australian Minister\nfor Education and Training. At the same time, the Secretary also makes reports to the Assistant Minister for\nEducation and Training.

All current Ministers are part of the Executive Council, but not all\nMinisters are also part of Cabinet. The Governor-General is the chair of the Executive Council.  \nMinister A, the Australian Minister for Education and Training, is part of Cabinet. Minister B, the Assistant Minister\nfor Education and Training is not part of Cabinet but is part of the Executive Council. Minister D, the Minister for\nJustice, is also not part of Cabinet but is part of the Executive Council.  \nCabinet\u2019s role is to direct the overall government policy and make decisions about national issues. In Cabinet\nmeetings, Ministers also present bills from their government departments. Cabinet examines these bills, and\nrecommends whether bills should proceed to Parliament or changes should be made. A Minister who is not part of\nCabinet may be invited to a Cabinet meeting to speak about developments within their portfolio. The Cabinet is\naccountable to Parliament for the running of the government.  \n-----  The Executive Council is a constitutional body charged with advising the Governor-General. Legally, members of the\nExecutive Council are chosen by the Governor-General; however, in practice, all current Ministers are part of the\nExecutive Council. The Executive Council acts as a formal ratification body for the decisions of Cabinet, and is\nrequired to undertake a range of functions including making proclamations, regulations and ordinances as delegated\nby various Acts of Parliament, issuing writs for elections, appointing public servants and recommending the\nappointment of judges.  \nSection 61 of the Australian Constitution provides that \u201cThe executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the\nQueen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen\u2019s representative, and extends to the execution and\nmaintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth\u201d. However, the Governor-General is bound\nby convention to follow the advice of the Executive Council.  \nBased on the facts and circumstances above, Minister A is a member of the key management personnel of the\nAustralian Government. As part of Cabinet and having regard to Cabinet\u2019s powers, Minister A has the authority and\nresponsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Australian Government. In addition, as a\nmember of the key management personnel of the Australian Government, Minister A is also a related party of any\nentities controlled by the Australian Government, consistent with paragraph 9 of the Standard.  \nMinister B and Minister D are unlikely to be members of the key management personnel of the Australian\nGovernment as, although they are part of the Executive Council, they are outside the group of persons responsible for\nmaking decisions about the overall running of the government. Further, in substance, neither the members of the\nExecutive Council nor Governor-General have the authority and responsibility for directing and controlling the\nactivities of the Australian Government, and accordingly, are not members of the key management personnel of the\nAustralian Government reporting entity.",

The State\nGovernment has determined that it does not control the University.  \nThe governing body of the University is the University Council. The University Council consists of 17 members, five\nof whom are appointed directly or indirectly by the State Minister for Education. The Chair of the University Council\nis the Chancellor, who is the formal head of the University. The Chancellor is responsible for ensuring the efficient\noperation of the University Council in the performance of its governance role, presiding at ceremonial occasions of\nthe University and acting as a signatory to official statutory reports of the University.  \nThe Act specifies that the University Council\u2019s responsibilities, powers and functions include:  \n-  approving the mission, strategic direction and annual budget and business plan of the University;  \n-  establishing policies (\u2018university statutes and regulations\u2019) relating to the governance and operation of the\nUniversity, including trusts and endowments, and research, development, consultancy, commercial\nactivities and other services undertaken for commercial organisations or public bodies;  \n-  developing guidelines (if any) concerning the carrying out of commercial activities, finance and property\nmatters, or any other related matter;  \n-  overseeing the management of the property, finances and business affairs of the University, such as risk\nmanagement across the University, including its commercial activities;  \n-  any other powers and functions conferred on it by or under legislation or any university statute or\nregulation; and  \n-  the power to do anything else necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with its powers and\nfunctions.  \nThe University Council has a range of powers and functions that it can exercise directly, including the following:  \n-  appointing the Vice-Chancellor, who is the chief executive officer of the University and responsible for the\nconduct of the University\u2019s affairs in all matters;  \n-  determining the composition of borrowings within the parameters set by the State Government;  \n-  approving the University\u2019s budget for a financial year, incorporating total revenue and the planned revenue\nsources, including planning the mix between teaching, research and commercial activities, the fees and\ncharges to apply to those activities, and the type and value of government grants desired;  \n-  determining the course mix and target student mix, such as vocational, undergraduate, graduate and\nexecutive courses, on-campus or distance learning, and local and international students;  \n-----  -  appointing staff and determining their terms and conditions;  \n-  deciding whether to operate through multiple campuses and how to utilise the University\u2019s infrastructure;\nand  \n-  making university regulations with respect to any matter relating to the University.  \nThe University Council has delegated the day-to-day management responsibilities and other functions to the\nUniversity\u2019s executive and other senior staff in order to be able to focus on the broader policy and strategic issues.  \nThe State Minister for Education has the following powers and functions as part of the Minister\u2019s role in the State\nGovernment:  \n-  fixing the remuneration and fees to be paid to University Council members who are not full-time staff of the\nUniversity or holders of statutory office;  \n-  approving (or vetoing) University statutes and guidelines made by the University Council;  \n-  declaring an activity to be a university commercial activity;  \n-  making interim guidelines concerning university commercial activities and finance and property matters \u2013\nthese apply unless replaced by University-submitted guidelines approved by the Minister;  \n-  in conjunction with the State Treasurer, approving the limits and conditions (eg security) for University\nborrowings;  \n-  approving (or vetoing) the disposal of land that was previously Crown land granted to the University;  \n-  requesting commercial and financial reports from the University;  \n-  referring a university commercial activity or any aspect thereof to the auditor-general for investigation; and  \n-  ensuring that the University complies with certain rights specified in State Government grants provided to\nthe University \u2013 some of the grants are required to be repaid if not applied as specified.  \nBased on the facts and circumstances above, as the State Government has determined that it does not control the\nUniversity, it is unlikely that the State Minister for Education, as the executor of the State Government\u2019s powers, is a\nmember of the key management personnel of the University, as the evaluation of control includes an assessment of the\nState Government\u2019s ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the University\u2019s outcomes. The State\nMinister\u2019s powers and functions (provided to the position) may restrict the way in which the University operates, but\ndo not of themselves give the State Minister authority and responsibility for the activities of the University.  \nRather, based on the facts and circumstances above, it is the University Council (who are akin to a board of directors,\nwith the Chancellor akin to a non-executive chairman) and the University\u2019s executive and other senior staff who have\nthe authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the University.  \nThe purpose of this Example is to assist entities with the identification of key management personnel of a not-forprofit public sector entity. However, an entity should also consider whether the State Minister for Education, or the\nState Government, will otherwise meet the definition of a related party of the University (see paragraph 9 of the\nStandard).",

The interest of the State Government\nin the activities of the Council is primarily to ensure that the general objectives set out in the Act are being achieved or\nfurthered. The State Government\u2019s rights in respect of the Council are held primarily by the State Minister for Local\nGovernment. These rights allow the State Government (via the State Minister for Local Government) to advise or\nguide the Council in its activities, or under particular circumstances, to intervene in the activities of the Council.  \nMinister X is the State Minister for Local Government. The Minister administers their portfolio through the Local\nGovernment branch of the State Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (the Department). As\npart of the Minister\u2019s role and responsibilities, Minister X is responsible for:  \n-  the scrutiny of councils, including municipal boundaries;  \n-  making recommendations for allocation of project grants to local governments for projects;  \n-  overseeing tendering processes for council services;  \n-  ensuring the concerns of local governments are communicated to the State Cabinet; and  \n-  the coordination of council community and infrastructure work at a State level.  \n-----  The Council\u2019s primary objective is to achieve the best outcomes for the local community over the long term. The\nCouncil is empowered by the Act to do all things necessary and convenient for the achievement of its objectives and\nthe performance of its functions, subject to any limitations under the Act or any other legislation.  \nThe Council is administered by 10 councillors, who are elected directly by the local community in periodic elections.\nThe Council\u2019s functions include raising revenue to fund its functions and activities, and planning for and providing\nservices and facilities (including infrastructure) for the local community. In carrying out its functions, the Council\nundertakes a wide range of activities including the imposition of rates and charges upon constituents, and the\nprovision without charge of services such as parks and roads. The day-to-day operations of the Council are carried\nout by council staff under the direction of its elected councillors.  \nThe State Government has determined that it does not control the Council.  \nBased on the facts and circumstances above, Minister X is not a member of the key management personnel of the\nCouncil, as the Minister\u2019s role does not extend to having the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and\ncontrolling the activities of the Council itself. Having concluded that the State Government does not control the\ncouncil, Minister X\u2019s role as executor of the State Government\u2019s powers and rights over the Council cannot of itself\nenable Minister X to meet the definition of key management personnel of the Council. Rather, in this example, it is\nthe councillors and senior council staff who have the authority and responsibility for the activities of the Council\n(similar to a board of directors and senior management of a company).  \nThe purpose of this Example is to assist entities with the identification of key management personnel of a not-forprofit public sector entity. However, an entity should also consider whether Minister X, or the State Government, will\notherwise meet the definition of a related party of the Council (see paragraph 9 of the Standard).",

As a statutory authority, SLA was\nestablished under its own enabling legislation, which sets out its functions, powers and responsibilities. Its remit is\nsuch that it generally operates independently of any governmental direction or influence.  \nSLA is funded by the State Government to undertake state law matters. The State Government may specify areas to\nwhich certain of the funds granted should be allocated. SLA is a controlled entity of the State Government.  \n-----  The execution and authority for the day-to-day operations of SLA are the responsibility of its executive management\nteam, who report to the Board of SLA. The Board is the statutory authority\u2019s governing body and is responsible for\nmanaging SLA and ensuring that its objectives are achieved. The Board is responsible for deciding SLA\u2019s priorities\nand strategies, leading its policy direction and ensuring its sound and prudent financial management. Board members\nare appointed by the State Governor in Council, on advice of the State Minister for Justice.  \nSLA is accountable to the State Government for the delivery of legal assistance services. As a statutory authority, the\nBoard of SLA reports to the State Minister for Justice, who is responsible to Parliament for the oversight of statutory\nauthorities within the Minister\u2019s portfolio.  \nSLA\u2019s enabling legislation provides that the Board must:  \n-  if asked by the State Minister for Justice, give the Minister a report on any issue relevant to its functions,\nother than about legal assistance for a particular person; and  \n-  act upon a written direction given by the State Minister for Justice about the performance of SLA\u2019s\nfunctions or exercise of its powers, and its policies, priorities or guidelines, including priorities in legal\nassistance funding. The direction cannot be about giving legal assistance to a particular person.  \nWhile SLA generally operates independently of any governmental direction or influence, from time to time, the State\nMinister for Justice has requested various reports and required SLA to act as directed.  \nBased on the facts and circumstances above, the Board and executive management team of SLA are members of the\nkey management personnel of the entity, as they ultimately have the authority and responsibility for planning,\ndirecting and controlling the activities of the entity. In this fact pattern, the State Minister for Justice is also a member\nof the key management personnel of SLA, as the powers vested in the Minister\u2019s role also give the Minister authority\nand responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, as SLA is required to act in\naccordance with the Minister\u2019s written directions (which may relate to SLA\u2019s execution of its remit).  \nThe purpose of this Example is to assist entities with the identification of key management personnel of a not-forprofit public sector entity. However, consideration should also be given to whether the State Government is a related\nparty of SLA (see paragraph 9 of the Standard).",

For example, a Minister who is a member of the key management personnel of the\nCommonwealth or State government is, under the definition of \u2018related party\u2019, a related party not only of\nthe Commonwealth or State government consolidated entity but also of each controlled entity of that\ngovernment (see Example 2 in paragraph IG6). In such instances, the Standard requires the controlled\ngovernment entity to disclose related party transactions with that Minister which are necessary to meet the\nobjective noted in paragraph 1 of the Standard, whether or not the Minister has responsibility for the entity.  \nIG11 A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between an entity and its related\nparty, regardless of whether a price is charged. In the not-for-profit public sector, many entities are likely to\nengage frequently with persons who are a related party of that entity in the course of delivering the entity\u2019s\npublic service objectives, including the raising of funds (for example, rates and taxes) to meet those\nobjectives. These related party transactions often occur on terms and conditions no different to those  \n-----  applying to the general public (for example, the Medicare rebate or public school fees). A not-for-profit\npublic sector entity may determine that information about related party transactions occurring during the\ncourse of delivering its public service objectives and which occur on no different terms to that of the general\npublic is not material for disclosure in its general purpose financial statements and accordingly need not be\ndisclosed. Guidance relevant to an entity\u2019s assessment of the materiality of a disclosure to its general\npurpose financial statements is included in AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and AASB 108\n_Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The factors described in paragraph 27_\nof the Standard may also assist an entity in making this determination.  \nIG12 Examples 7\u20138 describe different types of related party transactions that may occur between not-for-profit\npublic sector entities and their related parties:",

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC1 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board\u2019s considerations in\ndeciding to extend the scope of AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures (December 2009) to the not-for-profit\npublic sector. Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.  \nBC2 The first version of AASB 124, AASB 124 _Related Party Disclosures (July 2004), applied explicitly to_\ngeneral purpose financial statements of companies and other for-profit entities. The December 2005 and\nsubsequent versions of AASB 124 specifically exempt not-for-profit public sector entities from applying\nAASB 124. This exemption was provided on the grounds of practicability, including the number of intragovernment transactions.  \nBC3 The Board received representations from constituents that the disclosure of relevant related party\ninformation is a critical element of accountability in the public sector. A key example is information\nrelating to key management personnel of public sector entities, the disclosure of which is not required under\ncurrent Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC4 Following requests from its constituents to review IAS 24 _Related Party Disclosures, the International_\nAccounting Standards Board (IASB) made amendments to simplify the definition of \u2018related party\u2019 and, to\nease concerns about practicability, provide a partial exemption from the disclosure requirements for entities\nthat are related by virtue of being controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same\ngovernment. The Board incorporated the revised IAS 24 into AASB 124 (December 2009). The Board\nnoted that this version of AASB 124 provides a more appropriate basis for application by not for profit\npublic sector entities than the previous versions, as transactions between government-related entities of the\nsame jurisdiction are exempted partially from disclosure.  \nBC5 Therefore, in furtherance of its policy of promulgating transaction-neutral Standards to the extent feasible,\nthe Board initiated a project to consider issues relating to extending the scope of AASB 124 (December\n2009) to not-for-profit public sector entities. The Board issued Exposure Draft ED 214 Extending Related\n_Party Disclosures to the Not-for-Profit Public Sector in July 2011. ED 214 exposed for public comment the_\nBoard\u2019s proposal to extend the scope of AASB 124 to include not-for-profit public sector entities. The ED\nexplained the Board\u2019s reasons for its proposals, including its considerations as to the applicability of\nAASB 124 to a not-for-profit public sector context. In addition, public roundtables were conducted with\npublic sector constituents to identify concerns and implementation issues arising from the Board\u2019s\nproposals.  \nBC6 In finalising its proposals that not-for-profit public sector entities be required to apply AASB 124\nunamended, the Board addressed a range of issues, including consideration of:  \n(a) amending the definition of \u2018key management personnel\u2019 for such entities;  \n(b) amending the requirements to provide such entities with some relief from disclosure of\nministerial compensation;  \n(c) exempting such entities from disclosing certain related party transactions with Ministers;  \n(d) not requiring general government sector (GGS) financial statements to comply with AASB 124;  \n(e) adding a public sector perspective to AASB 124, for example by inserting an alternative\ndefinition for the term \u2018business\u2019 in paragraph 5 of AASB 124; and  \n(f) extending the disclosure requirements in AASB 124 for key management personnel.  \nEach of these issues and the outcome of the Board\u2019s considerations are noted below.  \nBC7 In finalising its proposals, the Board also considered constituent feedback for implementation guidance to\nbe developed to assist not-for-profit public sector entities in applying AASB 124. The Board noted that\nwhile some information about Ministerial or senior executive compensation or related party transactions\nmay be disclosed pursuant to other legislation or directives, the requirement to apply AASB 124 will be the\nfirst time that information about a not-for-profit public sector entity\u2019s related parties is specified by\nAustralian Accounting Standards for inclusion in its general purpose financial statements. Consequently,  \n-----  such entities may not have previously considered challenges in implementing the Standard\u2019s requirements\nin a not-for-profit public sector environment. The Board considered that these entities may also have\ndifficulty in identifying and determining the extent of the information necessary to meet the objective of\nAASB 124, as described in paragraph 1 of the Standard. Accordingly, the Board determined that the final\namendments would include implementation guidance to assist not-for-profit public sector entities with their\nimplementation of the Standard.",

        "page_content=": "## Significant issues  \nDefinition of key management personnel  \nBC8 The Board considered whether an amendment of the definition of key management personnel for the notfor-profit public sector would be necessary to facilitate a decision to remove the not-for-profit public sector\nexemption from AASB 124, but decided that the present definition was suitable. The AASB noted that, in a\npublic sector context, entities should consider the facts and circumstances in assessing whether a person is a\nmember of the key management personnel, as defined, of the entity.  \nBC9 The Board considered that normally, the determination of key management personnel will be similar for\nentities in the public sector or the private sector. For example, a not-for-profit public sector entity will need\nto determine whether all, or only certain, of its senior executive service employees meet the definition of\nkey management personnel. However, the Board acknowledged constituents\u2019 concerns that the\ndetermination of key management personnel may not be straightforward in the not-for-profit public sector\ngiven ministerial-type roles. The Board noted that it does not regard a Minister to always be a member of\nthe key management personnel of a not-for-profit public sector entity; rather, this is dependent on the\nparticular circumstances of the jurisdiction and of the entity. Accordingly, the Board decided to add\nguidance to the Standard, in the absence of a private sector analogy, to assist not-for-profit public sector\nentities in applying the definition of key management personnel to Ministers, as ministerial-type roles do\nnot usually arise in a private sector context.  \nBC10 The Board also noted that an entity may determine that a relevant Minister may not meet the definition of\nkey management personnel of an entity. However, the Board observed that this did not preclude that\nMinister from being otherwise identified as a related party of the entity, for example, where the Minister is a\nmember of the key management personnel of the entity\u2019s parent.",

        "page_content=": "## Key management personnel compensation \u2013 Ministers  \nBC11 Respondents to ED 214 raised concerns that the requirements of AASB 124 pertaining to the disclosure of\nkey management personnel compensation would be onerous if applicable to Ministers, noting also that any\nattribution of a Ministerial salary across entities coming under the responsibility of that Minister\u2019s portfolio\nwould involve significant judgement.  \nBC12 The Board considered whether some relief was necessary with respect to the compensation of a Minister\nwho is a member of the key management personnel of an entity. The Board observed that Ministers are\ntypically remunerated through Parliament via a central agency, and that a Minister\u2019s compensation, while\nrelated to their responsibilities, may not be related to services performed for any specific entity or group of\nentities.  \nBC13 The Board noted the addition of paragraphs 17A and 18A into AASB 124 since the comment period on\nED 214 closed. These paragraphs were inserted into AASB 124 by AASB 2014-1 _Amendments to_\n_Australian Accounting Standards (June 2014) to address the disclosures that apply where members of the_\nkey management personnel are not employees of the reporting entity (see paragraphs BC51 and BC52 of\nIAS 24). The Board considered that these paragraphs will be of relevance to a not-for-profit public sector\nentity when considering the disclosure of the compensation of a Minister who has been identified as part of\nthe key management personnel of the entity, and may alleviate the respondents\u2019 concerns noted in\nparagraph BC11. Accordingly, the Board decided that no amendment to AASB 124 to address the\ndisclosure of ministerial compensation was necessary at this time. However, the Board decided to add\nimplementation guidance to clarify the manner it considers paragraph 17A operates in relation to a\nMinister\u2019s compensation.",

        "page_content=": "## Related party transactions  \nBC14 The definition of \u2018related party\u2019 in AASB 124 separately addresses persons and entities related to the entity\npreparing general purpose financial statements. The partial exemption in AASB 124 from the disclosure  \n-----  requirements for government-related entities applies only in relation to those entities specified in paragraphs\n25(a) and 25(b) of that Standard, and not also to persons who are related parties covered by paragraph 17\n(key management personnel compensation) or paragraph 18 (transactions during the periods covered by the\nfinancial statements) of AASB 124.  \nBC15 Having regard to the partial exemption for government-related entities in AASB 124, the Board considered\nwhether providing an exemption for the disclosure of related party transactions with Ministers or local\ngovernment councillors was justified by any circumstances unique to the public sector and that may not\nhave been considered by the IASB, whose mandate is limited to for-profit entities. The Board\u2019s\nconsideration included the role of Ministers in a government and how onerous the disclosures required\nunder AASB 124 might be. As part of its consideration, the Board had regard to the New Zealand\nAccounting Standards Board\u2019s decisions relating to disclosures of related party transactions with Ministers.  \nBC16 The Board observed that Ministers who are members of the key management personnel of their government\nwould also be related parties not only of the government but also of each controlled entity of the\ngovernment. Accordingly, a subsidiary government entity will be required to disclose related party\ntransactions with Ministers who may have no responsibility for the entity to the extent the disclosures are\nconsidered material, from the entity\u2019s perspective, for disclosure. For example, the Board noted that in\nExample 1 of the Illustrative Examples accompanying AASB 124, Entities 1\u00ac, 2, A, B, C and D will be\nrequired to disclose in their financial statements related party transactions between a Minister who is a\nmember of the key management personnel of Government G and the entity, even where the Minister\u2019s\nportfolio does not include the entity.  \nBC17 The Board noted that, as is often the case with related party transactions, judgement would be required as to\nwhen transactions are material, especially when qualitative assessments are made about the nature of\ntransactions. The Board considered situations in which key management personnel of a not-for-profit\npublic sector entity, including Ministers or local government councillors where so identified, paid taxes,\nlevies or other statutory charges or fees faced generally by citizens, or used public services such as state\nhospitals or schools. The Board does not expect, absent unusual circumstances, that the application of\nmateriality would result in disclosure in many of these situations. In contrast, a commercial contract\nentered into by a Minister or local government councillor with a related public sector entity may be relevant\nfor disclosure, similar to a commercial contract between a member of the key management personnel of a\nfor-profit entity and the for-profit entity (for example, a contract to provide accountancy services between\nthe entity and an entity controlled by a member of its key management personnel). Accordingly, the Board\nobserved that a not-for-profit public sector entity would also need to apply judgement in determining the\nextent of information it needs to collect to meet the objective of AASB 124, as there is little value in an\nentity incurring significant costs to obtain data that is immaterial for disclosure. The Board noted that it\nwould expect appropriate criteria to be identified so that information about transactions that are possibly\nmaterial (for example, transactions that have occurred at a different price or volume to that applying to the\ngeneral public) is captured for assessment.  \nBC18 Having regard to the role of materiality, the Board decided that no specific exemption from disclosure of the\nrelated party transactions with key management personnel of a not-for-profit public sector entity, including\nany Ministers or local government councillors where so identified, was necessary. However, to respond to\nconstituents\u2019 requests for clarification on the extent of disclosures required of related party transactions that\noccur in the not-for-profit public sector, the Board decided to add implementation guidance to AASB 124 to\nassist not-for-profit public sector entities in this regard.",

The Board decided that such\ntransactions were in substance transactions between the entity and the government-related entity, rather than\nbeing transactions with the Ministers in their own right, and that no clarification to the Standard was\nnecessary in this regard (however, see also paragraphs BC20\u2013BC22 below).",

The Board noted that the IASB had indicated that it did not intend to require the entity to\nidentify every government-related entity or to quantify in detail every transaction with such entities, as such\na requirement would negate the exemption (see paragraph BC43 of IAS 24).  \nBC22 The Board noted that it shared the IASB\u2019s view communicated in paragraph BC45 of IAS 24. Paragraph\nBC45 of IAS 24 states:  \nBC45 The Board noted that this requirement should not be too onerous for the reporting entity because:  \n(a) individually significant transactions should be a small subset, by number, of total\nrelated party transactions;  \n(b) the reporting entity should know what those transactions are; and  \n(c) reporting such items on an exceptional basis takes into account cost-benefit\nconsiderations.  \nNevertheless, the Board decided to add implementation guidance to the Standard to respond to constituent\nconcerns about the extent of disclosure required by paragraph 26.",
