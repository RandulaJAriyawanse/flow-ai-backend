For example:  \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting period usually confirms\nthat the customer was credit-impaired at the end of the reporting period; and  \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give evidence about their net\nrealisable value at the end of the reporting period.  \n(c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets purchased, or the proceeds from\nassets sold, before the end of the reporting period.  \n-----  (d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of profit-sharing or bonus payments, if\nthe entity had a present legal or constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to make\nsuch payments as a result of events before that date (see AASB 119 Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial statements are incorrect.",
