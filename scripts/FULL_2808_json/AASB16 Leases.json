A lessee shall recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability\nas an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced\nto zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, a lessee shall recognise any\nremaining amount of the remeasurement in profit or loss.  \n40 A lessee shall remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount\nrate, if either:  \n(a) there is a change in the lease term, as described in paragraphs 20\u201321. A lessee shall determine the\nrevised lease payments on the basis of the revised lease term; or  \n(b) there is a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, assessed\nconsidering the events and circumstances described in paragraphs 20\u201321 in the context of a\npurchase option. A lessee shall determine the revised lease payments to reflect the change in\namounts payable under the purchase option.  \n41 In applying paragraph 40, a lessee shall determine the revised discount rate as the interest rate implicit in the\nlease for the remainder of the lease term, if that rate can be readily determined, or the lessee\u2019s incremental\nborrowing rate at the date of reassessment, if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily\ndetermined.  \n42 A lessee shall remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments, if either:  \n(a) there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee. A lessee\nshall determine the revised lease payments to reflect the change in amounts expected to be payable\nunder the residual value guarantee.  \n(b) there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to\ndetermine those payments, including for example a change to reflect changes in market rental rates\nfollowing a market rent review. The lessee shall remeasure the lease liability to reflect those revised  \n-----  lease payments only when there is a change in the cash flows (ie when the adjustment to the lease\npayments takes effect). A lessee shall determine the revised lease payments for the remainder of\nthe lease term based on the revised contractual payments.  \n43 In applying paragraph 42, a lessee shall use an unchanged discount rate, unless the change in lease payments\nresults from a change in floating interest rates. In that case, the lessee shall use a revised discount rate that\nreflects changes in the interest rate.  \n_Lease modifications_  \n44 A lessee shall account for a lease modification as a separate lease if both:  \n(a) the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying\nassets; and  \n(b) the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for\nthe increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the\ncircumstances of the particular contract.  \n45 For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, at the _effective date of the lease_\n_modification a lessee shall:_  \n(a) allocate the consideration in the modified contract applying paragraphs 13\u201316;  \n(b) determine the lease term of the modified lease applying paragraphs 18\u201319; and  \n(c) remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount\nrate. The revised discount rate is determined as the interest rate implicit in the lease for the\nremainder of the lease term, if that rate can be readily determined, or the lessee\u2019s incremental\nborrowing rate at the effective date of the modification, if the interest rate implicit in the lease\ncannot be readily determined.  \n46 For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lessee shall account for the\nremeasurement of the lease liability by:  \n(a) decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of\nthe lease for lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease. The lessee shall recognise in\nprofit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the lease.  \n(b) making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset for all other lease modifications.  \n46A As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent concession that meets the conditions\nin paragraph 46B is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election shall account for any change in\nlease payments resulting from the rent concession the same way it would account for the change applying this\nStandard if the change were not a lease modification.  \n46B The practical expedient in paragraph 46A applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence\nof the covid-19 pandemic and only if all of the following conditions are met:  \n(a) the change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the\nsame as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change;  \n(b) any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022\n(for example, a rent concession would meet this condition if it results in reduced lease payments\non or before 30 June 2022 and increased lease payments that extend beyond 30 June 2022); and  \n(c) there is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease.",

A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer**\n**substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.**  \n63 Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the substance of the transaction rather\nthan the form of the contract. Examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead\nto a lease being classified as a finance lease are:  \n(a) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;  \n(b) the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently\nlower than the fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain,\nat the inception date, that the option will be exercised;  \n(c) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset even if title is not\ntransferred;  \n(d) at the inception date, the present value of the lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of\nthe fair value of the underlying asset; and  \n(e) the underlying asset is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use it without major\nmodifications.  \n64 Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a lease being classified as a\nfinance lease are:  \n(a) if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor\u2019s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by\nthe lessee;  \n(b) gains or losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual accrue to the lessee (for example,\nin the form of a rent rebate equaling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and  \n(c) the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially\nlower than market rent.  \n65 The examples and indicators in paragraphs 63\u201364 are not always conclusive. If it is clear from other features\nthat the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying\nasset, the lease is classified as an operating lease. For example, this may be the case if ownership of the\nunderlying asset transfers at the end of the lease for a variable payment equal to its then fair value, or if there\nare variable lease payments, as a result of which the lessor does not transfer substantially all such risks and\nrewards.  \n66 Lease classification is made at the inception date and is reassessed only if there is a lease modification.\nChanges in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the\nunderlying asset), or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee), do not give rise to a new\nclassification of a lease for accounting purposes.",

A manufacturer or dealer lessor shall\nrecognise selling profit or loss on a finance lease at the commencement date, regardless of whether\nthe lessor transfers the underlying asset as described in AASB 15.  \n72 Manufacturers or dealers often offer to customers the choice of either buying or leasing an asset. A finance\nlease of an asset by a manufacturer or dealer lessor gives rise to profit or loss equivalent to the profit or loss\nresulting from an outright sale of the underlying asset, at normal selling prices, reflecting any applicable\nvolume or trade discounts.  \n73 Manufacturer or dealer lessors sometimes quote artificially low rates of interest in order to attract customers.\nThe use of such a rate would result in a lessor recognising an excessive portion of the total income from the\ntransaction at the commencement date. If artificially low rates of interest are quoted, a manufacturer or dealer\nlessor shall restrict selling profit to that which would apply if a market rate of interest were charged.  \n74 A manufacturer or dealer lessor shall recognise as an expense costs incurred in connection with obtaining a\nfinance lease at the commencement date because they are mainly related to earning the manufacturer or\ndealer\u2019s selling profit. Costs incurred by manufacturer or dealer lessors in connection with obtaining a finance\nlease are excluded from the definition of initial direct costs and, thus, are excluded from the net investment\nin the lease.  \n_Subsequent measurement_  \n**75** **A lessor shall recognise finance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant**\n**periodic rate of return on the lessor\u2019s net investment in the lease.**  \n76 A lessor aims to allocate finance income over the lease term on a systematic and rational basis.

However, an asset can also be\nidentified by being implicitly specified at the time that the asset is made available for use by the customer.  \n_Substantive substitution rights_  \nB14 Even if an asset is specified, a customer does not have the right to use an identified asset if the supplier has\nthe substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. A supplier\u2019s right to substitute an\nasset is substantive only if both of the following conditions exist:  \n(a) the supplier has the practical ability to substitute alternative assets throughout the period of use (for\nexample, the customer cannot prevent the supplier from substituting the asset and alternative assets\nare readily available to the supplier or could be sourced by the supplier within a reasonable period\nof time); and  \n(b) the supplier would benefit economically from the exercise of its right to substitute the asset (ie the\neconomic benefits associated with substituting the asset are expected to exceed the costs associated\nwith substituting the asset).  \nB15 If the supplier has a right or an obligation to substitute the asset only on or after either a particular date or the\noccurrence of a specified event, the supplier\u2019s substitution right is not substantive because the supplier does\nnot have the practical ability to substitute alternative assets throughout the period of use.  \nB16 An entity\u2019s evaluation of whether a supplier\u2019s substitution right is substantive is based on facts and\ncircumstances at inception of the contract and shall exclude consideration of future events that, at inception\nof the contract, are not considered likely to occur. Examples of future events that, at inception of the contract,\nwould not be considered likely to occur and, thus, should be excluded from the evaluation include:  \n(a) an agreement by a future customer to pay an above market rate for use of the asset;  \n(b) the introduction of new technology that is not substantially developed at inception of the contract;  \n(c) a substantial difference between the customer\u2019s use of the asset, or the performance of the asset,\nand the use or performance considered likely at inception of the contract; and  \n(d) a substantial difference between the market price of the asset during the period of use, and the\nmarket price considered likely at inception of the contract.  \nB17 If the asset is located at the customer\u2019s premises or elsewhere, the costs associated with substitution are\ngenerally higher than when located at the supplier\u2019s premises and, therefore, are more likely to exceed the\nbenefits associated with substituting the asset.  \nB18 The supplier\u2019s right or obligation to substitute the asset for repairs and maintenance, if the asset is not\noperating properly or if a technical upgrade becomes available does not preclude the customer from having\nthe right to use an identified asset.  \nB19 If the customer cannot readily determine whether the supplier has a substantive substitution right, the\ncustomer shall presume that any substitution right is not substantive.  \n_Portions of assets_  \nB20 A capacity portion of an asset is an identified asset if it is physically distinct (for example, a floor of a\nbuilding). A capacity or other portion of an asset that is not physically distinct (for example, a capacity portion  \n-----  of a fibre optic cable) is not an identified asset, unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset\nand thereby provides the customer with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use\nof the asset.",

A customer can obtain economic benefits from use of an asset directly\nor indirectly in many ways, such as by using, holding or sub-leasing the asset. The economic benefits from\nuse of an asset include its primary output and by-products (including potential cash flows derived from these\nitems), and other economic benefits from using the asset that could be realised from a commercial transaction\nwith a third party.  \nB22 When assessing the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of an asset, an entity\nshall consider the economic benefits that result from use of the asset within the defined scope of a customer\u2019s\nright to use the asset (see paragraph B30). For example:  \n(a) if a contract limits the use of a motor vehicle to only one particular territory during the period of\nuse, an entity shall consider only the economic benefits from use of the motor vehicle within that\nterritory, and not beyond.  \n(b) if a contract specifies that a customer can drive a motor vehicle only up to a particular number of\nmiles during the period of use, an entity shall consider only the economic benefits from use of the\nmotor vehicle for the permitted mileage, and not beyond.  \nB23 If a contract requires a customer to pay the supplier or another party a portion of the cash flows derived from\nuse of an asset as consideration, those cash flows paid as consideration shall be considered to be part of the\neconomic benefits that the customer obtains from use of the asset. For example, if the customer is required to\npay the supplier a percentage of sales from use of retail space as consideration for that use, that requirement\ndoes not prevent the customer from having the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from\nuse of the retail space. This is because the cash flows arising from those sales are considered to be economic\nbenefits that the customer obtains from use of the retail space, a portion of which it then pays to the supplier\nas consideration for the right to use that space.",

In making this assessment, an entity considers the decision-making rights that are most relevant to\nchanging how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use. Decision-making rights\nare relevant when they affect the economic benefits to be derived from use. The decision-making rights that\nare most relevant are likely to be different for different contracts, depending on the nature of the asset and the\nterms and conditions of the contract.  \nB26 Examples of decision-making rights that, depending on the circumstances, grant the right to change how and\nfor what purpose the asset is used, within the defined scope of the customer\u2019s right of use, include:  \n(a) rights to change the type of output that is produced by the asset (for example, to decide whether to\nuse a shipping container to transport goods or for storage, or to decide upon the mix of products\nsold from retail space);  \n-----  (b) rights to change when the output is produced (for example, to decide when an item of machinery\nor a power plant will be used);  \n(c) rights to change where the output is produced (for example, to decide upon the destination of a\ntruck or a ship, or to decide where an item of equipment is used); and  \n(d) rights to change whether the output is produced, and the quantity of that output (for example, to\ndecide whether to produce energy from a power plant and how much energy to produce from that\npower plant).  \nB27 Examples of decision-making rights that do not grant the right to change how and for what purpose the asset\nis used include rights that are limited to operating or maintaining the asset. Such rights can be held by the\ncustomer or the supplier. Although rights such as those to operate or maintain an asset are often essential to\nthe efficient use of an asset, they are not rights to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used and are\noften dependent on the decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used. However, rights to operate\nan asset may grant the customer the right to direct the use of the asset if the relevant decisions about how and\nfor what purpose the asset is used are predetermined (see paragraph B24(b)(i)).",

A lease is no\nlonger enforceable when the lessee and the lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without permission\nfrom the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty.  \nB35 If only a lessee has the right to terminate a lease, that right is considered to be an option to terminate the lease\navailable to the lessee that an entity considers when determining the lease term. If only a lessor has the right\nto terminate a lease, the non-cancellable period of the lease includes the period covered by the option to\nterminate the lease.  \nB36 The lease term begins at the commencement date and includes any rent-free periods provided to the lessee by\nthe lessor.  \nB37 At the commencement date, an entity assesses whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option\nto extend the lease or to purchase the underlying asset, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The\nentity considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to\nexercise, or not to exercise, the option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the\ncommencement date until the exercise date of the option. Examples of factors to consider include, but are not\nlimited to:  \n(a) contractual terms and conditions for the optional periods compared with market rates, such as:  \n(i) the amount of payments for the lease in any optional period;  \n(ii) the amount of any variable payments for the lease or other contingent payments, such as\npayments resulting from termination penalties and residual value guarantees; and  \n(iii) the terms and conditions of any options that are exercisable after initial optional periods\n(for example, a purchase option that is exercisable at the end of an extension period at a\nrate that is currently below market rates).  \n(b) significant leasehold improvements undertaken (or expected to be undertaken) over the term of the\ncontract that are expected to have significant economic benefit for the lessee when the option to\nextend or terminate the lease, or to purchase the underlying asset, becomes exercisable;  \n(c) costs relating to the termination of the lease, such as negotiation costs, relocation costs, costs of\nidentifying another underlying asset suitable for the lessee\u2019s needs, costs of integrating a new asset\ninto the lessee\u2019s operations, or termination penalties and similar costs, including costs associated\nwith returning the underlying asset in a contractually specified condition or to a contractually\nspecified location;  \n(d) the importance of that underlying asset to the lessee\u2019s operations, considering, for example, whether\nthe underlying asset is a specialised asset, the location of the underlying asset and the availability\nof suitable alternatives; and  \n(e) conditionality associated with exercising the option (ie when the option can be exercised only if\none or more conditions are met), and the likelihood that those conditions will exist.  \nB38 An option to extend or terminate a lease may be combined with one or more other contractual features (for\nexample, a residual value guarantee) such that the lessee guarantees the lessor a minimum or fixed cash return\nthat is substantially the same regardless of whether the option is exercised. In such cases, and notwithstanding\nthe guidance on in-substance fixed payments in paragraph B42, an entity shall assume that the lessee is\nreasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the\nlease.  \nB39 The shorter the non-cancellable period of a lease, the more likely a lessee is to exercise an option to extend\nthe lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. This is because the costs associated with obtaining\na replacement asset are likely to be proportionately higher the shorter the non-cancellable period.  \nB40 A lessee\u2019s past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used particular types of assets\n(whether leased or owned), and its economic reasons for doing so, may provide information that is helpful in\nassessing whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, or not to exercise, an option. For example, if a\nlessee has typically used particular types of assets for a particular period of time or if the lessee has a practice  \n-----  of frequently exercising options on leases of particular types of underlying assets, the lessee shall consider\nthe economic reasons for that past practice in assessing whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option\non leases of those assets.  \nB41 Paragraph 20 specifies that, after the commencement date, a lessee reassesses the lease term upon the\noccurrence of a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the control of the\nlessee and affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in its\ndetermination of the lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in its determination of the\nlease term. Examples of significant events or changes in circumstances include:  \n(a) significant leasehold improvements not anticipated at the commencement date that are expected to\nhave significant economic benefit for the lessee when the option to extend or terminate the lease,\nor to purchase the underlying asset, becomes exercisable;  \n(b) a significant modification to, or customisation of, the underlying asset that was not anticipated at\nthe commencement date;  \n(c) the inception of a sublease of the underlying asset for a period beyond the end of the previously\ndetermined lease term; and  \n(d) a business decision of the lessee that is directly relevant to exercising, or not exercising, an option\n(for example, a decision to extend the lease of a complementary asset, to dispose of an alternative\nasset or to dispose of a business unit within which the right-of-use asset is employed).",

        "page_content=": "## Lessor lease classification (paragraphs 61\u201366)  \nB53 The classification of leases for lessors in this Standard is based on the extent to which the lease transfers the\nrisks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. Risks include the possibilities of losses from\nidle capacity or technological obsolescence and of variations in return because of changing economic\nconditions. Rewards may be represented by the expectation of profitable operation over the underlying asset\u2019s\neconomic life and of gain from appreciation in value or realisation of a residual value.  \nB54 A lease contract may include terms and conditions to adjust the lease payments for particular changes that\noccur between the inception date and the commencement date (such as a change in the lessor\u2019s cost of the\nunderlying asset or a change in the lessor\u2019s cost of financing the lease). In that case, for the purposes of\nclassifying the lease, the effect of any such changes shall be deemed to have taken place at the inception date.  \nB55 When a lease includes both land and buildings elements, a lessor shall assess the classification of each element\nas a finance lease or an operating lease separately applying paragraphs 62\u201366 and B53\u2013B54. In determining\nwhether the land element is an operating lease or a finance lease, an important consideration is that land\nnormally has an indefinite economic life.  \nB56 Whenever necessary in order to classify and account for a lease of land and buildings, a lessor shall allocate\nlease payments (including any lump-sum upfront payments) between the land and the buildings elements in\nproportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and buildings element of\nthe lease at the inception date. If the lease payments cannot be allocated reliably between these two elements,\nthe entire lease is classified as a finance lease, unless it is clear that both elements are operating leases, in\nwhich case the entire lease is classified as an operating lease.  \nB57 For a lease of land and buildings in which the amount for the land element is immaterial to the lease, a lessor\nmay treat the land and buildings as a single unit for the purpose of lease classification and classify it as a\nfinance lease or an operating lease applying paragraphs 62\u201366 and B53\u2013B54. In such a case, a lessor shall\nregard the economic life of the buildings as the economic life of the entire underlying asset.",

These Standards require not-for-profit entities to measure\nright-of-use assets at initial recognition at fair value for leases that have significantly below-market\nterms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives.  \nBC3 For ease of reference in this Basis for Conclusions, leases that have significantly below-market terms\nand conditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives are referred to as \u2018concessionary\nleases\u2019.  \nBC4 The Board considered comments from stakeholders in the not-for-profit sector preparing for the\nimplementation of AASB 16 and AASB 1058, some of whom expressed difficulties in applying the\nprinciples in AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement in determining the fair value of right-of-use assets_\narising under concessionary leases. The difficulties noted included how often-significant restrictions on\nthe right of use of the underlying assets and the specialised nature of the underlying assets should be\nincorporated in the valuation of right-of-use assets arising from concessionary leases.  \nBC5 Whilst other assets required by other Standards to be fair valued might also be subject to restrictions on\nuse or specialised in nature, the Board noted that the issues related to right-of-use assets for lessees\nmight be different to the issues for owners of the assets, making it difficult to determine the fair value\nof right-of-use assets simply by reference to the fair value of the underlying assets. Since the principles\nin AASB 13 are based on market participants buying and selling assets, further guidance appears to be\nneeded to assist not-for-profit entities in applying the principles to right-of-use assets in concessionary\nlease arrangements.  \nBC6 The Board considered the prevalence and magnitude of concessionary leases in the not-for-profit sector,\nand the significance of restrictions on rights of use of the underlying assets in many cases. The Board\nalso noted that a temporary option for not-for-profit lessees to not measure a class (or classes) of\nright-of-use assets at initial recognition at fair value for concessionary leases would avoid undue cost\nand effort being incurred by preparers in applying AASB 13 in the absence of additional guidance. The\nBoard assessed these factors with reference to _The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting_\n_Framework and decided to propose the temporary option. The interpretative issues arising from fair_\nvaluing right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases will be addressed in the AASB\u2019s Fair\nValue Measurement for Public Sector Entities project.  \nBC7 The Board also noted that the financial reporting thresholds for not-for-profit private sector entities may\nbe revised as a result of the ACNC Legislative Review recommendations. It is possible that entities at\nthe lower level of the reporting thresholds might not be required in future to apply the requirements of\nAASB 16 and AASB 1058. The temporary option would avoid such smaller entities incurring costs in\nmeasuring right-of-use assets at initial recognition at fair value when they might be exempted from this\nrequirement in future by not being required to prepare financial statements that comply with Accounting\nStandards.  \nBC8 However, as some not-for-profit entities had already commenced the process of determining the fair value of\nright-of-use assets in concessionary leases, the Board decided to make the temporary relief optional. This  \n-----  allows these entities to continue their work on fair valuing concessionary leases and applying the fair value\ninitial recognition measurement requirements to measure right-of-use assets.  \nBC9 Entities electing not to measure the right-of-use assets in concessionary leases at fair value will recognise the\nassets at cost in accordance with AASB 16 (paragraphs 23\u201325), which incorporates the amount of the initial\nmeasurement of the lease liability.  \nBC10 The optional relief will be reassessed when further guidance has been developed to assist not-for-profit\nentities in fair valuing right-of-use assets and the financial reporting requirements for private sector\nnot-for-profit entities have been finalised. The Board will consider whether to provide a permanent option for\nnot-for-profit entities to measure a class of right-of-use assets at initial recognition either at cost or at fair\nvalue for those concessionary leases entered into prior to the application date of AASB 16 or for all\nconcessionary leases.",

The responses to ED 286\nindicated that:  \n(a) all respondents agreed that not-for-profit entities should be given some form of relief to not measure\nright-of-use assets for concessionary leases at initial recognition at fair value. Some respondents\nagreed that the relief should only be given on a temporary basis until further guidance has been\ndeveloped to assist not-for-profit entities in fair valuing right-of-use assets and the financial\nreporting requirements for not-for-profit private sector entities have been finalised. However, other\nrespondents were of the view that the option to elect either cost or fair value measurement should\nbe made available on a permanent basis for all concessionary leases and for not-for-profit entities\nin both the private sector and the public sector; and  \n(b) most respondents agreed that the proposed additional disclosure requirements in AASB 16 would\nprovide adequate information for users of the financial statements to understand the effects on the\nfinancial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity arising from concessionary\nleases in the absence of fair value information. However, some respondents suggested providing\nfurther clarification to ensure not-for-profit entities understand the disclosure requirements.  \nBC13 The Board considered the feedback and in December 2018 decided to finalise its decisions to provide a\ntemporary option for not-for-profit entities to elect to measure a class of right-of-use assets arising under\nconcessionary leases at cost or at fair value at initial recognition. At a later time, when fair value measurement\nguidance has been developed and the not-for-profit private sector financial reporting requirements have been\nfinalised, the Board will consider whether the temporary option should be made permanent.",

This may be the case for example where the not-for-profit entity has elected to apply the revaluation\nmodel under AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment to a class of property, plant and equipment and would\ntherefore likely elect to measure right-of-use assets that relate to that class also at fair value, as permitted by\nAASB 16, paragraph 35. However, this should not force the entity to also measure all other right-of-use assets\narising from concessionary leases on initial recognition at fair value.  \nBC15 Consequently, the Board decided that the election of the measurement basis for initial recognition of\nright-of-use assets of concessionary leases should be made by class of right-of-use assets.

In respect of not-for-profit entities, primary users of financial statements are concerned with\nthe ability of the entity to achieve its objectives. Therefore, when assessing whether a concessionary lease is\nmaterial to the financial statements, the entity could consider factors such as the significance of the\nconcessionary lease to the entity\u2019s operations in fulfilling its objectives.  \nBC19 Some respondents recommended the Board consider clarifying the extent of disclosures required in AASB 16\nparagraphs Aus59.1 and Aus59.2. Consistent with AASB Practice Statement 2, an entity applies judgement\nin determining the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective, including the level of\naggregation or disaggregation of disclosures so that useful information is not obscured.

These Standards originally required not-for-profit entities to measure\nright-of-use assets at initial recognition at fair value for leases that have significantly below-market terms and\nconditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives.  \nBC3 For ease of reference in this Basis for Conclusions, leases that have significantly below-market terms and\nconditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives are referred to as \u2018concessionary leases\u2019.  \nBC4 The Board considered comments from stakeholders that some not-for-profit entities are encountering\ndifficulties in applying the principles in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement in determining the fair value of\nright-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases. The Board considered the prevalence and magnitude\nof concessionary leases in the not-for-profit sector, and in December 2018 issued AASB 2018-8 Amendments\n_to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Right-of-Use Assets of Not-for-Profit Entities to provide a temporary_\noption for not-for-profit lessees to measure a class (or classes) of right-of-use assets at initial recognition at\ncost or at fair value arising under concessionary leases.  \nBC5 Subsequently the Board received feedback that public sector entities preparing Whole of Government and\nGeneral Government Sector financial statements would need to revalue their right-of-use assets arising under\nconcessionary leases (and other leases) at fair value at subsequent measurement to satisfy the requirements\nof AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting to elect_\naccounting treatments in Accounting Standards that align with the principles in the ABS GFS Manual. The\nBoard considered the issue and decided to provide an option for the Whole of Government and the General\nGovernment Sector to measure right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases at cost or at fair value\nin subsequent measurements, which is an extension of the existing temporary relief provided in AASB 2018-8\nin relation to initial recognition.  \nBC6 Stakeholders also requested clarification of whether right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases\ncan be treated as a separate class of right-of-use assets to right-of-use assets arising under other leases so that\nentities can have the option to measure right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases under a different\nbasis to right-of-use assets arising under other leases.

        "page_content=": "## Subsequent measurement of right-of-use assets of Whole of Government and General Government Sector  \nBC7 The Board received feedback from stakeholders that public sector entities apply the revaluation model in\nAASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment to measure their property, plant and equipment at fair value to\nalign with Government Finance Statistics (GFS) principles (ie measurement of assets at current market value).\nThey are concerned that, to satisfy the requirements in paragraph 13 of AASB 1049, public sector entities\nwould be required to also apply the revaluation model to measure right-of-use assets arising under\nconcessionary leases at fair value at subsequent measurement.  \nBC8 As stated in paragraph BC6 of AASB 2018-8, temporarily permitting not-for-profit entities to elect to measure\nright-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases at either cost or fair value at initial recognition was\nintended to avoid not-for-profit entities, including those in the public sector, incurring undue cost and effort  \n-----  in applying the principles of AASB 13 to measure the fair value of right-of-use assets arising under\nconcessionary leases in the absence of further guidance on fair value measurement. However, stakeholders\ncommented that limiting the relief only to initial measurement did not appear to have achieved this for public\nsector not-for-profit entities.  \nBC9 The Board noted that there is precedent for deferring measurement requirements for the not-for-profit public\nsector. For example, the Board deferred the requirement to recognise defence weapons platforms at fair value\nwhen the ABS GFS Manual was amended to treat defence weapons platforms as assets rather than immediate\nexpenses. Paragraph BC3 to the amending Standard AASB 2012-8 Amendments to AASB 1049 \u2013 Extension\n_of Transitional Relief for the Adoption of Amendments to the ABS GFS Manual relating to Defence Weapons_\n_Platforms (appended to AASB 1049) suggested that the Board considered the magnitude and complexity of_\nthe valuation exercise for defence weapons platforms and decided that an extension of transitional relief for\ntwo years would be required for the Australian Government to be able to comply. The Board also deferred\nthe requirement to recognise land under roads (first from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2006, then\nfurther to 31 December 2007) considering the lack of international convergence on the recognition of land\nunder roads. When finalising AASB 1051 Land Under Roads, the Board considered that it might be onerous\nfor entities to be required to retrospectively identify, assess the recognition criteria, recognise and measure\nland under roads previously acquired, and decided to allow entities to elect whether to recognise land under\nroads acquired before the end of the first reporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007 (AASB 1051,\nparagraph BC11).  \nBC10 The Board also considered that its project on reforming the Australian public sector financial reporting\nframework could reduce the magnitude of having material right-of-use assets arising under concessionary\nleases being measured at fair value if it is determined that general purpose financial statements are not required\nto be prepared by all public sector entities, other than Whole of Government and General Government Sector.\nThe Board also considered that it might also be prudent to not introduce further amendments to AASB 1049\nuntil the planned post-implementation review of AASB 1049 has been completed.  \nBC11 However, since the public sector financial reporting framework reform, the post-implementation review of\nAASB 1049 and the guidance on fair value measurement are not expected to be completed when public sector\nentities need to prepare their financial statements for the 2019/20 financial year, the Board decided to extend\nthe current temporary relief in relation to initial measurement to provide an option for the Whole of\nGovernment and the General Government Sector to measure right-of-use assets arising under concessionary\nleases at cost or at fair value in subsequent measurements. The Board made this decision in accordance with\n_The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework (paragraph 28(d)) to avoid undue cost and_\neffort in applying the principles of AASB 13 in measuring the fair value of these assets before the Board\nissues further fair value measurement guidance. The Board therefore amended paragraph 13D of AASB 1049\nto remove the initial recognition proviso for measuring a class of right-of-use assets arising under\nconcessionary leases at cost or fair value.  \nBC12 The temporary relief described in paragraph BC11, in relation to subsequent measurements of right-of-use\nassets arising under concessionary leases, is provided only to Whole of Government and General Government\nSector because AASB 1049 specifies requirements only for Whole of Government and General Government\nSector financial statements. Other public sector entities, such as government agencies and local governments,\nare not subject to AASB 1049 and are not required by current Accounting Standards to adopt a fair-value\napproach in measuring non-financial assets. These entities therefore do not need the temporary relief provided\nunder AASB 1049. Whether these entities are required to adopt a fair-value approach is a matter for the\nTreasury or Finance Department or other authority in each jurisdiction.  \nBC13 Consistent with its decisions in AASB 2018-8 (see paragraph BC16 of AASB 2018-8), the Board considers\nthat the additional disclosure requirements in paragraphs Aus59.1 and Aus59.2 of AASB 16 apply in the\nabsence of fair value information at any reporting date when right-of-use assets arising under concessionary\nleases are measured at cost, subsequent to their initial recognition at cost. This ensures adequate information\nis disclosed for users of financial statements to understand the effects on the financial position, financial\nperformance and cash flows of the entity arising from concessionary leases.",

The Board was of\nthe view that the definition created would not be consistent with the concept of a class of assets in other\nStandards, which looks only at the nature and use of the assets in an entity\u2019s operations. AASB 16\nparagraphs 53(a) and (j) require disclosure of the depreciation charge and the carrying amount for\nright-of-use assets by class of underlying asset, this will be less meaningful when the disclosures\naggregate amounts for different right-of-use asset classes measured on different bases. The Board also\nconsidered that developing a new definition might require further guidance to be developed to assist\npreparers in applying the new definition; and  \n-  Option 3 \u2013 specify that right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases may be treated as a separate\nclass of right-of-use assets from right-of-use assets arising under other leases. As with Option 2, this\noption would not be consistent with the concept of a class of assets in other Standards, which looks only\nat the nature and use of the assets and aggregated right-of-use asset disclosures under AASB 16 may be\nless meaningful.  \nBC17 The Board considered the advantages and disadvantages of each option and decided to adopt\nOption 3 \u2013 specify that right-of-use assets of not-for-profit entities arising under concessionary leases may be\ntreated as a separate class of right-of-use assets from right-of-use assets arising under other leases. This option\nis expected to be the simplest to apply without limiting the scope of the exemption from the requirements to\nmeasure right-of-use assets at fair value in advance of public sector not-for-profit entity guidance on applying\nfair value. The Board noted specifying that right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases can be\ntreated as a separate class of right-of-use assets from right-of-use assets arising under other leases would not\nbe consistent with the concept of a class of assets in other Standards, which looks only at the nature and use\nof the assets. However, the Board considered this would be a pragmatic and limited response to the issue for\nnot-for-profit entities, and added paragraph Aus25.2 to AASB 16.

They questioned whether right-of-use\nassets related to concessionary finance leases can be considered a separate class of right-of-use assets.  \nBC19 Even though electing measurement models based on the GFS categories of operating lease and finance lease\ncould achieve better GFS alignment, the Board considered that this would conflict with the accounting\nmeasurement basis for leases, given the removal of the operating and finance lease distinction for lessees.\nAASB 1049 paragraph 13 does not require consistency with GFS in the event of a conflict. Permitting the\nelection of cost or fair value measurement based on GFS categories would risk prioritising GFS alignment\nover faithful and comparable presentation of right-of-use assets in statements of financial position. Therefore,\nthe Board considered that lessees\u2019 election of cost or fair value measurement should not be based on the\nsuperseded categories of finance lease and operating lease for lessees.  \n-----  BC20 However, the Board concluded that it would be appropriate to permit not-for-profit public sector entities to\nmeasure separate classes of right-of-use assets based on those arising from concessionary leases and those\narising under other leases on different bases. That is, one of those classes could be measured at cost and the\nother at fair value, if the lessee applies the revaluation model to the class of property, plant and equipment to\nwhich the right-of-use assets relate. Thus a modification to paragraph 35, which does not refer to classes of\nright-of-use assets, is required, and so the Board added paragraph Aus35.1 to AASB 16.  \nBC21 The Board noted that entities would not be required to remeasure right-of-use assets of existing concessionary\nfinance leases at cost if they have already applied the fair value model to those lease assets under AASB 117\nand would now measure the class of right-of-use assets at cost. Under paragraph C11 of AASB 16, entities\ncan use the AASB 117 carrying amounts (fair value) as the basis for applying AASB 16 under the modified\ntransition approach, without having to remeasure those amounts.  \n-----  ",

Where the not-for-profit entity recognised revenue within the scope of AASB 15 and a\nnon-refundable upfront payment is charged to the customer, AASB 15 paragraphs 22\u201330, B48\u2013B51 and F20\u2013  \n-----  F27 require an entity to assess whether the upfront fees relate to the transfer of a promised good or service. If\nthe upfront fees do relate to a transfer of goods or services, revenue is recognised over the time the service or\ngoods are provided rather than on receipt of the funds.  \nBC11 Stakeholders raised this issue from the perspective of diversity in practice, where some entities are deferring\nrevenue (and recognising a contract liability in accordance with AASB 15) and other entities are continuing\nto recognise revenue on receipt of fees which, prima facie, look very similar. Stakeholders also indicated that\nthe principle of deferral is confusing to boards, management committees, members and other users as the\namounts received are not refundable. Stakeholders requested further guidance to clarify the principle and why\na contract liability is recognised when the funds will never be repaid.  \nBC12 The Board considered the stakeholder comments and assessed the feedback with reference to the AASB Not_for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework. Whilst the original conclusions in Illustrative Example 3A in_\nAASB 1058 are appropriate, the Board proposed amending the example to clarify the conclusion further and\nadding an additional example to illustrate a contrasting scenario.

        "page_content=": "### Not-for-profit private sector lessees\nBC14 The Board noted feedback from not-for-profit private sector stakeholders that, despite having the accounting\npolicy choice to initially measure right-of-use assets arising under concessionary leases at cost, uncertainty\nexists whether fair value information needs to be obtained for such right-of-use assets. This uncertainty exists\nbecause it is unclear whether the Board would be likely to require retrospective application of the initial fair\nvalue requirement if it decides in the future to remove the accounting policy choice to initially measure such\nright-of-use assets at cost. Stakeholders commented that if retrospective application was required, the\ncollection of fair value information for historical concessionary leases, particularly those leases that have been\nin place for a significant period, would be costly and time consuming. At its November 2021 meeting, the\nBoard discussed the initial measurement requirements for concessionary right-of-use assets with a view to\nproviding certainty to not-for-profit private sector lessees.  \nBC15 The Board acknowledged that, conceptually, requiring right-of use assets arising under concessionary leases\nto be initially measured at fair value is consistent with the accounting treatment applied to other assets\nacquired on below-market terms and conditions and better reflects the value of the right-of-use asset obtained\nby the lessee in its financial position and financial performance. However, the Board considered that the costs\nrequired to obtain the fair value of such right-of-use assets would outweigh the benefits for not-for-profit\nprivate sector entities. This is because:  \n(a) many not-for-profit private sector entities may not have the knowledge and experience in applying\nthe principles of AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement because they generally do not measure nonfinancial assets at fair value. The cost and effort required to understand and apply AASB 13\nrequirements for the one-off purpose of initially recognising a right-of-use asset under a\nconcessionary lease might be considered unjustified;  \n(b) some stakeholders have commented that the disclosures required by AASB 16, including the\nrequirements in AASB 16 paragraphs Aus59.1\u2500Aus59.2, appear to provide sufficient information\nto users of financial statements about concessionary leases for them to understand the effects of the\nleases on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity, in the absence\nof fair value information; and  \n-----  (c) some stakeholders have commented that recognising income resulting from initially measuring\nsuch right-of-use assets at fair value, and the subsequent amortisation of the right-of-use assets,\nmight not meet the information needs of users of financial statements. This might particularly be\nthe case when a user is more interested in the entity\u2019s expenses that need to be funded rather than\nthe value of an asset consumed during the financial period that would not need to be funded.  \nBC16 Therefore, having regard to the AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework, the Board decided\nto propose retaining the accounting policy choice in AASB 16 paragraphs Aus25.1\u2013Aus25.2 on an ongoing\nbasis (ie with no plan to reconsider the accounting policy choice) for not-for-profit private sector lessees to\nelect to initially measure a class of concessionary right-of-use assets at cost or fair value.",
