AASB 1056 also addressed deficiencies in\nAAS 25 and made the requirements for superannuation entities more consistent with the current requirements in\nAustralian Accounting Standards.  \nParagraphs BC3 to BC6 of the attached Basis for Conclusions provide more background on the purpose of developing\nAASB 1056.",

This reflected that at the time superannuation entities were not required by\nthe Corporations Act or other legislation to prepare and lodge financial statements with a regulator.  \nThe Standard is now reissued by the AASB as a legislative instrument under section 334 of the Corporations Act. This\nis in response to amendments to the Corporations Act that require registrable superannuation entities to prepare annual\nfinancial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards and lodge them on the public record with the\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission. Since the requirements of this Standard differ in some respects\nfrom other Australian Accounting Standards, it is necessary for this Standard to also be a legislative instrument in order\nto take precedence over the other Standards as necessary.  \nIn converting AASB 1056 into a legislative instrument, the AASB has not changed the requirements. However, some\noutdated requirements and material have been deleted in this version of AASB 1056:  \n(a) the application paragraph identifying the entities and financial statements to which the Standard applies\n(paragraph 2) \u2013 the application of Standards is now set out in AASB 1057 _Application of Australian_\n_Accounting Standards;_  \n(b) the transitional provision (paragraph 37) that permitted an entity applying the Standard for the first time to\nnot present a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the first comparative period \u2013\nsuperannuation entities initially applying the reissued AASB 1056 would have prepared a statement of\nfinancial position under the original AASB 1056; and  \n(c) the section addressing the main differences between AASB 1056 and AAS 25 \u2013 as AAS 25 ceased to apply\nwhen AASB 1056 became applicable to periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016, the comparison has no\ncontinuing relevance.  \nThe AASB is also currently undertaking a post-implementation review of AASB 1056. That work will identify whether\nchanges are required to the substantive requirements of the Standard.",

The AASB considers that the AASB\u2019s reasons for not\nadopting IAS 26 remain valid in respect of AASB 1056. Those reasons are outlined in paragraphs BC7 to BC11 of the\nBasis for Conclusions.  \nThe main differences between AASB 1056 and IAS 26 include the following.  \n(a) AASB 1056 requires the presentation of a comprehensive set of financial statements for superannuation\nentities, whether they constitute one or more superannuation plans and whether they have defined contribution\nmembers or defined benefit members, or both. In contrast, IAS 26 requires a defined contribution plan to\npresent a statement of net assets available for benefits, and permits a defined benefit plan to present either:  \n(i) a statement showing net assets available for benefits, the actuarial present value of promised\nretirement benefits, and the resulting excess or deficit; or  \n(ii) a statement of net assets available for benefits including either a note disclosing the actuarial present\nvalue of promised retirement benefits, or a reference to this information in an accompanying\nactuarial report;  \n(b) AASB 1056 requires most assets to be measured at fair value, whereas IAS 26 permits investment assets to\nbe measured at an amount other than fair value when \u201can estimate of fair value is not possible\u201d; and  \n(c) AASB 1056 requires measurement of defined benefit member liabilities to involve assumptions that would\ninclude projected salary levels, whereas IAS 26 permits the actuarial present value of promised retirement\nbenefits to be based on either current or projected salary levels.  \n-----  ",

Other superannuation entities act in the\ncapacity of insurers and, therefore, take on insurance risks.  \nAG41 Factors that might be considered in determining whether a superannuation entity is acting as an agent in\nrespect of the insurance arrangements provided to members include:  \n(a) members (or their beneficiaries) will only receive insurance benefits if the external insurer/reinsurer\npays claims;  \n(b) insurance premiums are only paid through the superannuation entity for administrative reasons; and  \n(c) insurance premiums are effectively set directly by reference to premiums set by an external insurer.  \nAG42 It is not necessarily indicative of a superannuation entity taking on the role of an insurer simply because:  \n(a) (group) insurance cover is taken out in the name of the superannuation entity trustee;  \n(b) claim benefits are paid to members (or their beneficiaries) via the superannuation entity; and  \n(c) ex gratia payments have occasionally been made by the trustees in respect of death and disability\nbenefits.",

The defined benefit member liability\nis effectively the sum of the expected values associated with the various ways in which members might be\npaid their benefits. It is relevant to consider the defined benefit member liability as a single item made up of\ninter-related components, rather than to seek to identify particular components for presentation purposes, such\nas an insurance component. Accordingly, liabilities and assets arising from insurance arrangements a\nsuperannuation entity provides to defined benefit members need not be presented as a separate liability in the\nstatement of financial position. Furthermore, unless there are explicit direct premiums, claims, reinsurance\npremiums or claim recoveries relating to insurance risks, revenues and/or expenses relating to insurance\narrangements a superannuation entity provides to defined benefit members need not be presented separately\nin the income statement or statement of changes in member benefits.  \n-----  AG46 Liabilities arising from insurance arrangements a superannuation entity provides to defined contribution\nmembers shall be presented separately from the entity\u2019s liabilities for such members\u2019 benefits in the statement\nof financial position.  \nAG47 Assets arising from the reinsurance arrangements of a superannuation entity related to defined contribution\nmembers shall be presented separately.  \nAG48 Insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contract assets are recognised and measured in accordance with\nthe approach to measuring defined benefit member liabilities, whether they relate to defined contribution or\ndefined benefit members. Shortcut techniques could be applied to measure insurance contract liabilities, for\nexample, deferring and matching premiums over the period, provided the amount is not materially different\nfrom the amount that would be determined using the approach to measuring defined benefit member\nliabilities.  \nAG49 If a reinsurance asset is impaired, its carrying amount shall be reduced accordingly and an impairment expense\nrecognised in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if, and only if:  \n(a) there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the\nreinsurance asset, that the amounts due from the reinsurer may not be received under the terms of\nthe contract; and  \n(b) that event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts receivable from the reinsurer.",

In line with general market expectations, discount rates are slightly higher\nat the current reporting date compared with the previous reporting date across all four plans, which had the effect of\nreducing defined benefit member liabilities. The Plan has no information that would lead it to adjust the assumptions\naround salary adjustment rates, pension index rates, resignations and mortality, which are all unchanged from the\nprevious reporting period.  \nThe Plan engages qualified actuaries on an annual basis to measure the defined benefit member liabilities in each of its\nfour defined benefit plans. The Plan uses sensitivity analysis to monitor the potential impact of changes to key variables\nabout which assumptions need to be made. The Plan has identified two assumptions (discount rate and rate of salary\nadjustment) for which changes are reasonably possible that would have a material impact on the amount of the liabilities.  \nThe assumed discount rate for the four plans has been determined by reference to the investment returns expected on\nthe investment portfolio that reflects the opportunities reasonably available to the Plan in investment markets, which\nalso reflects the Plan\u2019s actual investments and investment strategy in respect of defined benefit member liabilities. The\nassumed discount rate is the same for each of the four defined benefit plans.  \nDefined member benefits in each of the Plan\u2019s four plans are based on an average of each member\u2019s salary at specified\nanniversary dates in each of the last three years of their expected membership of their plan. The assumed annual salary\nadjustments for each of the entity\u2019s four plans has been determined by reference to the Wage Price Index produced by\nthe Australian Bureau of Statistics and in consultation with the employer-sponsors. The rate is the same for each of the\nABC, OPQ and RST defined benefit plans. XYZ members are in an industry that is expected to experience generally\nhigher than average salary adjustments.  \nThe other variables about which assumptions have been made in measuring defined benefit member liabilities and for\nwhich changes are not considered reasonably possible, or for which reasonably possible changes would not be expected\nto have a material effect, include pension index rates, mortality rates and resignations.  \nThe following are sensitivity calculations on a univariate basis for the discount rate and rate of salary adjustment\nassumptions for the XYZ defined benefit plan and for the ABC, OPQ and RST defined benefit plans in aggregate.  \n|Assumption for XYZ plan|Assumed at reporting date|Reasonably possible change|Amount of (increase) decrease in member benefit liability \u2013 $000|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Discount rate|5.0%|+0.5% \u20130.5%|2,280 (2,549)|\n|Salary adjustment rate|4.0%|+1.0% \u20131.0%|(3,001) 3,350|  \n|Assumption for ABC, OPQ and RST plans|Assumed at reporting date|Reasonably possible change|Amount of (increase) decrease in member benefit liability \u2013 $000|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Discount rate|5.0%|+0.5% \u20130.5%|4,378 (4,809)|\n|Salary adjustment rate|3.0%|+1.0% \u20131.0%|(5,762) 6,143|",

This includes the development of the proposals made_\nin two Exposure Drafts (ED 179 _Superannuation_ _Plans and Approved Deposit Funds and ED 223_\n_Superannuation Entities) and the AASB\u2019s re-deliberations of those proposals. Individual Board members_\ngave greater weight to some factors than to others.  \nBC2 In the process of developing AASB 1056, the AASB also identified a number of topics that are beyond the\nscope of AASB 1056 or are linked to issues that would have an impact on a wide range of entities. These\ntopics include issues around the measurement of liabilities using discounted cash flow techniques and the\nnature of the reporting entity in a superannuation context, which are likely to form the basis of future research\nby the AASB Research Centre. The outcomes of this research might impact on issues the AASB raises with\nthe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) or impact on the application of Australian Accounting\nStandards.",

Accordingly, the Standard was intended to apply in the\nplace of other Australian Accounting Standards on financial reporting issues that were considered most\nsignificant to superannuation plans. AAS 25 was also intended to address the financial reporting issues that\nsuperannuation plans were specifically dealing with at the time (the early 1990s).  \nBC4 However, in recent years, developments in the superannuation industry and the adoption of International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) mean there has been the need for a comprehensive review of the general\npurpose financial reporting requirements applicable to superannuation entities, particularly the requirements\nin AAS 25. For example, the increasing significance of superannuation entities that have both defined\ncontribution members and defined benefit members (hybrid superannuation entities) highlights deficiencies\nin AAS 25, which had requirements that lead defined contribution and defined benefit superannuation plans\nto prepare their financial statements on different bases.  \nBC5 There were also deficiencies in AAS 25 when compared to the requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards applied by other entities. These include AAS 25 permitting entities not to recognise member\nliabilities in respect of defined benefit members.  \nBC6 Only limited improvements were made to AAS 25 since its issue in 1993.[1]",

The AASB concluded that IAS 26 should not be adopted in Australia because its\napplication by Australian superannuation entities would be unlikely to result in financial statements that meet  \n1 In late 2005, as a result of a process involving the issue of Invitation to Comment ITC 9 Superannuation Plans \u2013 Financial Liabilities,\nthe AASB made two amendments to AAS 25 through AASB 2005-13 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards. One_\namendment was to require a hedging instrument or derivative to be recognised at net market value, whether it has a debit or credit balance,\nwith any changes recognised in profit or loss for the period. A second amendment confirmed that a superannuation plan holding a\ncontrolling interest in another entity would apply AASB 3 Business Combinations and AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial\n_Statements. AAS 25 was also amended in 2013 to remove references to the materiality Standard through AASB 2013-9 Amendments to_\n_Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Conceptual Framework, Materiality and Financial Instruments._  \n-----  users\u2019 information needs and would potentially reduce the quality of financial reporting by superannuation\nentities.  \nBC8 In particular, the AASB considered that IAS 26 would not result in useful information on the capacity of a\nsuperannuation entity to meet its member liabilities. For example, IAS 26:  \n(a) contemplates that a plan would invest in assets for which it is impossible to estimate fair value, and\npermits those assets to be measured at an amount other than fair value; and  \n(b) permits the actuarial present value of \u2018promised retirement benefits\u2019 to be based on either current\nor projected salary levels.  \nBC9 In contrast to IAS 26, AAS 25 required all assets held by a superannuation plan to be measured at a current\nvalue (consistent with Australian prudential measurement requirements). The AASB also considered other\nrelevant IFRS being adopted in Australia and noted that the requirements of IAS 26 are highly dissimilar from\nthe requirements of most other IFRS. For example, in contrast to IAS 26, IAS 19 _Employee_ _Benefits_\n(AASB 119 Employee _Benefits) requires plan assets attributable to defined benefit obligations to be measured_\nat fair value in determining an employer-sponsor\u2019s net defined benefit obligations.  \nBC10 The AASB considers that the reasons identified for not adopting IAS 26 (and retaining AAS 25) remain valid\nin respect of AASB 1056.  \nBC11 The AASB also considered the implications of withdrawing AAS 25 and requiring superannuation entities to\napply, where appropriate, Australian Accounting Standards. The AASB concluded that, while the financial\nreporting requirements for superannuation entities can, in many respects, be enhanced by being more closely\naligned with corresponding requirements of other Standards, there remains a need for a specific Standard to\nhelp ensure the general purpose financial statements (GPFSs) of superannuation entities cater for the needs\nof users.",

        "page_content=": "### Users of the general purpose financial statements of superannuation entities  \nBC12 The AASB concluded that the following are most prominent among the users of GPFSs of superannuation\nentities:  \n(a) current and potential members and beneficiaries;  \n(b) parties that act on behalf of members and beneficiaries, such as financial analysts, advisors and\nunions; and  \n(c) employer-sponsors.  \nBC13 This is because the primary responsibility of superannuation entities is to provide retirement benefits to their\nmembers, and both employees and employers contribute to those entities.  \nBC14 Financial analysts and advisors are generally servicing a wide variety of existing and potential superannuation\nentity members and may use superannuation entity financial statements in the course of their work.  \nBC15 The Superannuation _Guarantee_ _(Administration)_ _Act_ _1992 provides most superannuation members the right_\nto choose the superannuation entity managing their entitlements, thereby reducing the incentives for\nemployers to provide corporate superannuation arrangements. An employer without a plan of its own is\nrequired to identify an appropriate default plan for employees. Consequently, employers seeking a\nsuperannuation entity to meet their employees\u2019 superannuation needs might use the financial statements of\nan entity to gain assurances regarding its financial position and performance.  \nBC16 Employers that provide defined benefit entitlements, particularly through master trusts and other similar\narrangements, are interested in a superannuation entity\u2019s financial statements in order to evaluate whether the\narrangement is cost-beneficial and the capacity of the assets to fund entitlements as and when they fall due.  \nBC17 The AASB concluded that, for some items, the reporting requirements that would otherwise apply under\nAustralian Accounting Standards would not necessarily give rise to relevant financial information for users\nof superannuation entity financial statements. This is particularly the case in relation to measuring assets,\nrecognising member liabilities, measuring defined benefit member liabilities and disclosing information about\nthe amount of, and the entity\u2019s capacity to meet, member liabilities. As a consequence, the AASB concluded\nthere is a need to:  \n(a) require superannuation entities to depart from Australian Accounting Standards on some topics;  \n(b) limit the accounting treatments available to superannuation entities in other Australian Accounting\nStandards; and  \n(c) require superannuation entities to provide information about items and events specific to them.  \n-----  ",

The\nAASB received 20 comment letters on ED 179 from a range of constituents, including superannuation plans,\nsuperannuation industry representative bodies, accounting firms, professional accounting and actuarial bodies\nand service providers to the superannuation industry. The AASB also held roundtable discussions on ED 179\nwith a range of constituents with an interest in the superannuation industry to enable them to discuss the\nproposals directly with AASB members.  \nBC19 Based on the responses to ED 179 and the AASB\u2019s redeliberations, in December 2011, the AASB published\nED 223 containing revised proposals for a replacement Standard for AAS 25. The AASB received 17\ncomment letters on ED 223 from a range of constituents and also held roundtable discussions on ED 223.\nThe feedback from both ED 179 and ED 223 and other forms of outreach that the AASB has performed\nbetween 2012 and 2014 have shaped AASB 1056.  \nBC20 The majority of respondents to both ED 179 and ED 223 expressed broad support for developing a\nreplacement Standard that:  \n(a) provides greater transparency and consistency in reporting by superannuation entities; and  \n(b) substantially aligns the reporting practices of superannuation entities with other entities applying\nAustralian Accounting Standards, thereby facilitating greater comparability.  \nBC21 Each of the respondents expressed concerns with one or more of the proposals in ED 179, particularly on\ncost-benefit grounds, which the AASB considered in developing ED 223. Further revisions have been made\nin developing AASB 1056 in response to issues raised by constituents on the revised proposals in ED 223.\nThe revisions arising from the consultative process include matters relating to:  \n(a) presenting financial statements, including a statement of changes in member benefits;  \n(b) recognising defined benefit member liabilities;  \n(c) measuring both defined contribution member and defined benefit member liabilities;  \n(d) measuring assets;  \n(e) accounting for liabilities and assets that might arise from insurance arrangements provided to\nmembers;  \n(f) disclosing information about the nature, extent and management of credit, liquidity and market\nrisks; and  \n(g) disclosing disaggregated information.  \nBC22 In the process of finalising AASB 1056, the AASB approved a Draft AASB 1056 for fatal-flaw review that\nwas published in December 2013 for a 60-day comment period.

Accordingly,\nthe replacement Standard would apply to each reporting entity that is a defined contribution plan, defined\nbenefit plan, \u2018hybrid\u2019 plan (comprising both defined contribution and defined benefit members), private sector\nplan, public sector plan, eligible rollover fund or approved deposit fund.  \nBC26 Whilst a number of respondents to ED 179 and ED 223 argued that some SMSFs would often be reporting\nentities, the AASB concluded that an entity such as a SMSF would not normally be a reporting entity because:  \n(a) each member is required to be a trustee (or a director of a corporate trustee) and to have access to\nthe entity\u2019s financial information; and  \n-----  (b) the primary external user is the Australian Taxation Office, which requires specific information for\ncompliance and regulatory purposes.  \nBC27 During its deliberations, the AASB gave particular consideration to whether the replacement Standard for\nAAS 25 should apply to pooled superannuation trusts. The AASB noted pooled superannuation trusts and\nsuperannuation plans, particularly defined contribution superannuation plans, share a number of\ncharacteristics. For example, they are both required to comply with many of the same prudential\nrequirements, are taxed at the same concessional tax rate and accept monies from other superannuation\nentities.  \nBC28 However, the AASB concluded pooled superannuation trusts are more in the nature of investment trusts, such\nas managed investment schemes, because they have unitholders rather than members, and there are no\nmember-based restrictions over when they can distribute funds to a unitholder. Accordingly, to facilitate\ncomparable financial reporting among investment-type trusts, the AASB concluded pooled superannuation\ntrusts should apply Australian Accounting Standards in the same manner as managed investment schemes.  \nBC29 Respondents to ED 179 and ED 223 expressed general agreement with the proposed scope and the AASB\nconcluded that the replacement Standard for AAS 25 should reflect those application proposals.",

        "page_content=": "### Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards  \nBC30 Subsequent to issuing ED 179, the AASB promulgated AASB 1053 _Application_ _of_ _Tiers_ _of_ _Australian_\n_Accounting_ _Standards, which establishes a differential reporting framework consisting of two tiers of_\nreporting requirements for preparing GPFSs:  \n(a) Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and  \n(b) Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR).  \nBC31 In the process of developing AASB 1053, the AASB issued ED 192 _Differential_ _Reporting_ _Framework_\n(February 2010), which noted that:  \n\u201cAAS 25 Financial _Reporting_ _by_ _Superannuation_ _Plans has been excluded from the RDR on the grounds that_\nentities applying AAS 25 would be superannuation plans registered with the Australian Prudential Regulation\nAuthority, which are regarded as publicly accountable in this Exposure Draft. Superannuation entities that\napply AAS 25 and prepare general purpose financial statements are required, under the _Superannuation_\n_Industry (Supervision) Act_ _1993, to hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for their members. In addition, most_\nsuperannuation entities, particularly public offer superannuation plans and approved deposit funds, have a\nbroad range of members who have no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the entity.\u201d  \nBC32 Some respondents to ED 192 questioned whether all APRA-regulated entities, particularly SAFs, should be\nconsidered to have \u2018public accountability\u2019. They noted that, while SAFs lodge financial statements with\nAPRA, they are not made publicly available, APRA does not mandate that SAFs prepare GPFSs and most, if\nnot all, SAFs are similar in nature and size to SMSFs.  \nBC33 During its redeliberations on ED 179, the AASB noted SAFs are defined by APRA as superannuation plans\nwith less than five members and have an Extended Public Offer Entity licence. As such, members of a SAF\nappoint a trustee with a Public Offer Entity licence to manage the plan on their behalf. While SAFs must\nlodge APRA returns that include information reported in their financial statements, this information is not\npublicly available for individual SAFs. In addition, the AASB noted SAFs would not be considered publicly\naccountable or reporting entities because they are small, have few members who have a close relationship\nwith the trustee and SAFs normally prepare special purpose financial statements.  \nBC34 ED 223 included a question asking constituents whether there are any superannuation entities that would meet\nthe criteria in AASB 1053 for applying Tier 2 disclosure requirements and the AASB also conducted targeted\noutreach on the issue, including in respect of so-called \u2018paragraph 66 plans\u2019. Paragraph 66 of AAS 25 permits\nsuperannuation plans whose only assets (other than temporary deposits at call with a bank) are endowment,\nwhole of life or other long-term insurance policies which match and fully guarantee the benefits to be paid to\nindividual members to apply only a sub-set of its recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements,\nprovided they report items such as: whether those policies have been fully maintained as directed by the\ninsurer(s), the identity of the insurer(s), and amounts contributed by employers and members during the\nreporting period, and the expenses of the plan incurred by the trustees during the reporting period.  \nBC35 The AASB concluded superannuation entities are currently divided between Tier 1 entities (including\nindustry plans, public sector plans, retail plans, eligible rollover funds, corporate plans and approved deposit\nfunds) and non-reporting entities (including SAFs and SMSFs). Accordingly, in the context of AASB 1056,\nthere are entities that prepare GPFSs by applying all the relevant Australian Accounting Standards and those\nthat need not prepare GPFSs. Consistent with AASB 1053, there is no applicable second Tier of general\npurpose financial reporting requirements for superannuation entities.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "### Measurement of assets at fair value  \nBC44 AAS 25 required a superannuation plan to measure its assets at market value less costs that would be expected\nto be incurred in realising the proceeds from their disposal. The AASB considered a number of alternative\napproaches, including measuring assets:  \n(a) in a manner consistent with the approach under AAS 25;  \n(b) in accordance with the various requirements of relevant Australian Accounting Standards; and  \n(c) in a manner consistent with AASB 1023 _General_ _Insurance_ _Contracts and AASB 1038_ _Life_\n_Insurance_ _Contracts, under which assets are required to be measured at fair value through profit or_\nloss where that is required or permitted in other Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC45 With respect to approaches (b) and (c), the AASB noted some Australian Accounting Standards currently\nprovide a choice between alternative measurement methods, particularly cost and fair value through profit or\nloss, and some require cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, for particular types of assets.\nHowever, the AASB regards measurement of superannuation entity assets at cost or at fair value through\nother comprehensive income to be inconsistent with the needs of users in the investment performance of\nsuperannuation entities, and inconsistent with the prudential measurement requirements.  \nBC46 The AASB concluded the AAS 25 approach is an appropriate starting point, and that there are a number of\ncompelling arguments in favour of requiring a superannuation entity to use fair value through profit or loss\nrather than net market value.  \nBC47 Both net market value measurements and fair value measurements provide useful information for users of the\nfinancial statements of a superannuation entity about:  \n(a) the capacity of a superannuation entity with defined contribution members to pay benefits as the\ninformation reflects the interests of members; and  \n(b) the financial position (solvency) of a superannuation entity with defined benefit members as the\ninformation reflects the capacity of the entity to meet member liabilities.  \nHowever, the approach for measuring assets under AAS 25 is inconsistent with the approach for measuring\nequivalent assets under other Australian Accounting Standards. In addition, fair value measurement is more\ncomprehensively dealt with in the accounting literature, in particular, AASB 13 Fair _Value_ _Measurement._\nAccordingly, the AASB considers requiring fair value measurement would enhance the comparability of the\nfinancial statements of superannuation entities with other entities.  \nBC48 Both ED 179 and ED 223 proposed that superannuation entities measure their assets at fair value through\nprofit or loss, with the exception of tax assets, and any assets arising from insurance arrangements the entity\nprovides to its members.  \nBC49 Most of the respondents that specifically commented on the ED 179 and ED 223 asset measurement proposals\nexpressed general agreement with them. One respondent expressed concern that assets be measured at \u2018bid\u2019\nprices and liabilities be measured at \u2018ask\u2019 prices. However, the AASB noted that entities reporting under\nAAS 25 should, in principle, measure their assets at bid prices and liabilities other than member liabilities at\nask prices because AAS 25 is based on an exit value model. The AASB also noted that, while some\nsuperannuation entities may be currently measuring assets at their \u2018mid\u2019 prices, this is presumably because\nany differences between the assets\u2019 bid and mid prices are not material.  \nBC50 In the interests of providing useful information on investment performance and in light of respondents\u2019\ncomments, the AASB concluded the replacement Standard for AAS 25 should require fair value through\nprofit or loss measurement for most assets.  \nBC51 In coming to this conclusion, the AASB noted:  \n(a) a superannuation entity would apply AASB 13, which takes a principles-based approach to\ndetermining fair value measurement; and  \n(b) any implementation issues a superannuation entity might encounter in applying AASB 13 are\nunlikely to be unique and would potentially arise in the context of other investment-type entities,\nsuch as managed investment schemes.  \n-----  Accordingly, the AASB concluded it is not necessary to include additional fair value measurement guidance\nin the replacement Standard for AAS 25.",

        "page_content=": "### Transaction costs\nBC52 Under AAS 25, a superannuation plan is required to measure its assets net of anticipated disposal costs. In\ndeveloping ED 179, the AASB considered a number of different treatments for transaction costs, including:  \n(a) separate recognition as an expense when incurred; and  \n(b) as a reduction of the carrying amounts of assets.  \nBC53 The AASB concluded ED 179 should propose transaction costs be treated as a reduction in the carrying\namounts of assets because:  \n(a) members and beneficiaries would regard information about assets net of transaction costs as useful\nas it might have a direct bearing on assessing a superannuation entity\u2019s capacity to pay benefits;  \n(b) it would facilitate alignment between financial reporting requirements and member reporting\npractices; and  \n(c) it is consistent with the treatment of assets under some Australian Accounting Standards, such as\nAASB 5 Non-current _Assets_ _Held_ _for_ _Sale_ _and_ _Discontinued_ _Operations in respect of assets held_\nfor immediate sale.  \nBC54 Several respondents to ED 179 expressed disagreement with the proposal to adjust fair value amounts for\ntransaction costs because:  \n(a) the treatment is inconsistent with the approach required under most Australian Accounting\nStandards, including AASB 139 Financial _Instruments: Recognition_ _and_ _Measurement;[3] and_  \n(b) transaction costs are generally an immaterial amount relative to a superannuation entity\u2019s net assets.  \nBC55 During its redeliberations on ED 179, the AASB also noted:  \n(a) AASB 13 requires that, while transaction costs be considered when determining the most\nadvantageous market, the price used to measure the fair value of an asset (or liability) should, in\nprinciple, not be adjusted for such costs. As noted in paragraph 25 of AASB 13:  \n\u201c\u2026 Transaction costs are not a characteristic of an asset or a liability; rather, they are specific\nto a transaction and will differ depending on how an entity enters into a transaction for the asset\nor liability\u2026\u201d; and  \n(b) defined contribution members and beneficiaries would regard information about assets net of\ntransaction costs as useful because it may help clarify whether all members and beneficiaries are\nbeing treated equitably, including different generations of members.[4] However, the AASB rejected\nthe intergenerational equity argument, noting that it would be better facilitated by a superannuation\nentity determining crediting rates for defined contribution members on a basis that reflects\nanticipated transaction costs. The AASB also noted that these types of intergenerational equity\nissues are not as relevant in a defined benefit context because benefits are determined on the basis\nof a member\u2019s salary.  \nBC56 In light of respondents\u2019 comments, ED 223 proposed not permitting the carrying amounts of assets measured\nat fair value to be adjusted for transaction costs. The AASB also proposed that, to facilitate consistency across\nsuperannuation entities in relation to transaction costs, the application of AASB 5 should be prohibited.  \nBC57 There was general support from constituents commenting on the asset measurement proposals in ED 223 and\nthe AASB concluded fair values should not be adjusted for transaction costs.  \n3 AASB 9 Financial Instruments had not yet been issued.  \n4 Intergenerational inequities can arise when exiting members do not \u2018pay\u2019 a share of the transaction costs because the superannuation\nentity has the capacity to pay departing member benefits out of cash on hand or else out of ongoing contributions and income. In such\ncircumstances, members who remain in the entity may eventually incur transaction costs that would otherwise have been shared equally\namongst all members if they had all exited the entity at the same time. In addition, members with relatively large account balances may\nbe charged transaction costs as a consequence of their superannuation plan selling some of its assets whereas other members with\nrelatively smaller balances may not be charged transaction costs if their entitlements are paid out of funds from other sources.  \n-----  ",

Accordingly, the AASB proposed that a superannuation entity should\nmeasure its liabilities at fair value, with the exception of member liabilities, tax liabilities, and liabilities\narising from insurance arrangements the entity might provide to its members. In addition, consistent with its\ndecision in relation to the treatment of transaction costs in respect of assets, the AASB proposed in ED 223\nthat a superannuation entity should treat transaction costs attributable to each liability measured at fair value\nas an increase in its carrying amount.  \nBC61 Consistent with constituent comments on measuring assets, the majority of respondents agreed with the\nED 223 measurement proposals for liabilities. The AASB concluded it should require fair value measurement\nfor liabilities other than member liabilities, tax liabilities and liabilities arising from insurance arrangements.\nConsistent with its conclusions on transaction costs in relation to assets, the AASB also concluded it should\nrequire that:  \n(a) the carrying amount of liabilities measured at fair value not be adjusted for transaction costs; and  \n(b) costs attributable to issuing a liability be treated in accordance with the relevant Australian\nAccounting Standards.",

They suggested such presentation might be misleading to users where,\nfor example:  \n(a) an entity has several groups of defined benefit members and the difference is attributable to only\none or some of these groups;  \n(b) there is no specific contractual arrangement between the entity and relevant employer-sponsor(s)\nbut it is probable the employer-sponsor(s) will make sufficient future contributions to eliminate any\ndeficit; or  \n(c) there is an expectation any surplus (reserves) of the entity will be used for the future benefit of\nmembers.  \nBC73 The AASB noted these concerns, but concluded they are not sufficient to justify an entity not presenting a\ndifference between assets and liabilities in its financial statements because:  \n-----  (a) the extent of any surplus or deficit of net assets is useful information regarding the entity\u2019s capacity\nto pay defined contribution members\u2019 benefits and/or financial position (solvency) with respect to\ndefined benefit members\u2019 entitlements;  \n(b) if an entity considers users of its financial statements might misunderstand the implications of any\nsurplus or deficit, consistent with paragraph 55 of AASB 101, the entity would present additional\nline items by way of explanation, and/or make further note disclosures; and  \n(c) unless there is a present obligation at reporting date to pay reserves to a member and/or employersponsor, the reserve is equity in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC74 Several respondents were also concerned an entity might be permitted or required to present its liabilities for\ndefined contribution and defined benefit members\u2019 benefits as a single line item under the ED 179 proposals.\nThe AASB noted, because defined contribution member liabilities are different in nature and would be\nmeasured on a different basis from defined benefit member liabilities; consistent with the approach in\nparagraph 59 of AASB 101 and, when appropriate, the entity would present separately its liabilities for the\ntwo types of benefits.  \nBC75 Several respondents suggested that a statement of changes in equity would not provide sufficient useful\ninformation to users in a superannuation context to justify the cost of preparation and audit. They suggested\nthe information that would otherwise be presented in a statement of changes in equity be included in:  \n(a) the statement of changes in member benefits because equity in a superannuation context is normally\nsmall (if not immaterial) and in most cases would comprise reserves that will ultimately be used\nfor the benefit of members; or  \n(b) a note to the financial statements.  \nBC76 The AASB concluded it should require the recognition of the difference between total assets and total\nliabilities in the statement of financial position and require a statement of changes in equity. However, the\nAASB noted that there may be situations when a statement of changes in equity may not be material.  \nBC77 The AASB also concluded that, consistent with the sentiments in paragraphs 5 and 6 of AASB 101,\nsuperannuation entities should employ terminology that best suits their circumstances. Accordingly,\nsuperannuation entities might use a term such as \u2018reserve\u2019 rather than \u2018equity\u2019 in referring to line items or in\nnaming statements.",

However, other respondents acknowledged the\ndistinction between the tax on investment income and tax on concessional contributions and the relevance of\npresenting them in different statements.  \nBC96 The AASB concluded that tax levied on concessional contributions should be presented separately in the\nstatement of changes in member benefits because:  \n(a) information about tax on contributions is important for decision making by users;  \n(b) tax on concessional contributions is effectively paid by a superannuation entity on behalf of\nmembers and should be associated with member benefits; and  \n(c) recognising tax on contributions as a part of income tax expense attributable to earnings would\nunderstate the entity\u2019s operating and investment performance.  \nBC97 The AASB also noted that, under Interpretation 1019 _The_ _Superannuation_ _Contributions_ _Surcharge, an_\nobligation for the surcharge gives rise to a liability and an expense of a superannuation entity.

However, for\nsome defined benefit members, the amount of defined benefit members\u2019 vested benefits may be\nmaterially different from the amount of such members\u2019 accrued benefits; and  \n(c) most defined contribution members are entitled to transfer their vested benefits to another regulated\nsuperannuation entity under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act, whereas most\ndefined benefit members are prohibited from transferring their defined benefit entitlements by the\nsame legislation.  \nBC104 Accordingly, the AASB proposed in ED 179 and ED 223 that:  \n(a) consistent with the treatment of a financial liability with a demand feature under AASB 139,\ndefined contribution members\u2019 vested benefits should be recognised as liabilities of superannuation\nentities; and  \n(b) consistent with the recognition of net defined benefit member liabilities of employers under\nAASB 119, superannuation entities should recognise defined benefit member liabilities.  \nBC105 Most respondents to ED 179 and ED 223 agreed with the proposal to recognise member liabilities. However,\nmany of them disagreed with the measurement proposals (refer to paragraphs BC120 to BC123 and BC127).",

        "page_content=": "### Defined benefit members\u2019 accrued benefits\nBC113 In developing ED 179 and ED 223, the AASB considered a number of bases for measuring defined benefit\nmember liabilities, including:  \n(a) at fair value consistent with the IASB Discussion Paper proposals that have now led to AASB 13;  \n(b) at current exit value consistent with a model in the IASB\u2019s Discussion Paper Preliminary _Views_ _on_\n_Insurance_ _Contracts;[9]_  \n(c) at present value of the expected future benefit payments consistent with the requirements of\nAAS 25; and  \n8 AASB 2008-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations arising on Liquidation\namended AASB 132 in February 2008.  \n9 Issued in May 2007.  \n-----  (d) at present value of the expected future benefit payments consistent with AASB 119 for defined\nbenefit member liabilities.  \nBC114 With respect to paragraphs BC113(a) and BC113(b), the AASB noted:  \n(a) a fair value or current exit value could potentially:  \n(i) provide useful information to users, particularly in relation to the amount, timing and\nuncertainty of future benefit payments; and  \n(ii) facilitate consistency of reporting (with most assets being measured at fair value);  \n(b) defined benefit member liabilities are not traded as stand-alone items and are generally\nextinguished in the normal course of business. While the absence of an active market for defined\nbenefit member liabilities does not preclude such fair value measurement, the issues that would\nneed to be addressed to achieve consistency across superannuation entities would be potentially\ninsurmountable. The issues include estimating risk margins, service margins and costs of capital,\nand putting a price on the \u2018moral hazard\u2019 implications of one or more (third party) employersponsors deciding on employees\u2019 salary adjustments; and  \n(c) fair value or current exit value would be inconsistent with:  \n(i) achieving closer alignment between the treatment of defined benefit member liabilities\nrecognised by employer-sponsors and superannuation entities;  \n(ii) thinking included in the IASB Exposure Draft of proposed amendments to IAS 37\n_Provisions,_ _Contingent_ _Liabilities_ _and_ _Contingent_ _Assets and IAS 19_ _Employee_\n_Benefits,[10] that the amount an entity would rationally pay to extinguish a liability is the_\nlower of its settlement or transfer amounts; and  \n(iii) the reasoning behind the proposals to apply a \u2018fulfilment approach\u2019 in the AASB\u2019s\nED 244 _Insurance_ _Contracts, which incorporates the IASB\u2019s ED/2013/7_ _Insurance_\n_Contracts.[11]_  \nBC115 Due to the relative weight of argument, the AASB concluded against proposing that defined benefit members\u2019\naccrued benefits be measured at fair value or current exit value.  \nBC116 In relation to paragraph BC113(c), the AASB noted that, while the requirements in AAS 25 for measuring\ndefined benefit members\u2019 accrued benefits are conceptually consistent with the requirements in AASB 119\nfor measuring defined benefit member liabilities, AAS 25 is arguably more permissive. For example,\nAAS 25:  \n(a) does not specify the actuarial valuation method required to measure defined benefit members\u2019\naccrued benefits;  \n(b) provides little or no guidance in relation to assumptions used in measuring defined benefit member\nliabilities; and  \n(c) requires a superannuation plan to measure its defined benefit members\u2019 accrued benefits as\nfrequently as required for statutory purposes, which might not be annually.  \nBC117 The AASB also noted AAS 25 required a superannuation plan to discount defined benefit members\u2019 accrued\nbenefits at the rate of return the plan anticipates it could achieve if, at the measurement date, sufficient funds\nwere available to meet members\u2019 accrued benefits as they fall due. The AASB considered the merits of this\napproach and rejected it because the discount rate might be affected by the actual types of assets held by a\nplan and AAS 25 does not establish a sufficient link between that rate and the nature or amounts of the plan\u2019s\nliabilities. The AASB was particularly concerned that, under AAS 25, a plan could potentially recognise a\nsmaller amount for its defined benefit member liabilities than it would otherwise by holding riskier assets\nwith potentially higher expected rates of return.  \nBC118 In relation to paragraph BC113(d), the AASB decided that, to achieve greater consistency across\nsuperannuation entities, and to facilitate consistency with the measurement of defined benefit and other\nliabilities by other entities, the approach in AASB 119 should be proposed in ED 179, on the following basis:  \n(a) use actuarial techniques and assumptions to make a reliable estimate of expected future cash flows;  \n(b) determine the present value of liabilities using the projected unit credit method;  \n(c) be permitted to apply estimates, averages and computational shortcuts for determining its liabilities;\nand  \n10 Issued in June 2005.  \n11 Issued in June 2013.  \n-----  (d) measure liabilities at the end of each reporting period to help ensure users have useful information\non a timely basis.  \nBC119 However, the AASB also decided some of the AASB 119 measurement requirements in respect of defined\nbenefit member liabilities may need to be modified for application in a superannuation entity context. In\nparticular, the AASB decided ED 179 should propose that:  \n(a) expected administration costs not be included because, although they may be regarded as a\ncomponent of the ultimate cost of an employer in meeting defined benefit member liabilities, they\ndo not constitute a part of members\u2019 accrued benefits;  \n(b) if a superannuation plan\u2019s benefit formula prescribes that members accrue materially higher levels\nof benefits as they near retirement age, rather than attribute benefits to reporting periods on a\nstraight-line basis, the superannuation entity would attribute member benefits to reporting periods\non a basis appropriate to its circumstances;[12]  \n(c) consistent with the _Framework, a superannuation entity would consider its assumptions to be_\nunbiased if they are not imprudent or conservative (AASB 119 states actuarial assumptions are\nunbiased if they are neither imprudent nor excessively conservative); and  \n(d) expected future benefit payments be discounted for the time value of money using a risk-free\ndiscount rate based on current observable, objective rates that relate to the nature, structure and\nterms of the obligations for future benefit payments. The AASB decided the AASB 119\nrequirement to determine discount rates by reference to market yields on high quality corporate\nbonds, or by applying yields on government bonds, is not relevant in a superannuation entity\ncontext.  \nBC120 Many respondents to ED 179 disagreed with the measurement proposals for defined benefit members\u2019 accrued\nbenefits. The reasons they cited include the following.  \n(a) Superannuation plans must currently calculate at least two, and potentially three, different liability\nmeasures:  \n(i) vested benefits on a quarterly basis for prudential reporting, and sometimes more\nfrequently for trustee monitoring and reporting to employer-sponsors;  \n(ii) accrued benefits (discounted at the entity\u2019s estimated earnings rate) at least every three\nyears for funding purposes and to meet prudential and legislative requirements; and  \n(iii) accrued benefits are potentially required to be calculated every year for the purpose of\nfinancial reporting by employer-sponsors under AASB 119.  \nAccordingly, requiring another liability measure would not be justified on cost-benefit grounds.  \n(b) The amount of defined benefit members\u2019 accrued benefits measured under ED 179 would be likely\nto differ from the amount for the same members measured under AASB 119, which could give rise\nto confusion among users.  \n(c) The amount of defined benefit members\u2019 accrued benefits measured under ED 179 would be likely\nto be greater than the amount for the same members measured for the actuarial review because the\nentity\u2019s estimated earnings rate will generally be used to discount future benefits for the purpose of\nthe actuarial review and will generally be greater than a risk-free rate. Accordingly, deficits would\nbe more likely to be reported under ED 179. As employer-sponsors are generally disinclined to\nmake contributions above those needed for funding purposes, members may incorrectly conclude\ntheir entitlements are at risk.  \nBC121 Some respondents to ED 179 preferred that defined benefit member liabilities be measured at the amount of\nvested benefits for a number of reasons, including:  \n(a) the amount of vested benefits is easier and less costly to calculate than accrued benefits;  \n(b) users, particularly members, are more familiar with the concept of vested benefits (as it is reported\nin individual benefit statements). Also, users arguably have relatively less understanding of\naccrued benefits and what they mean in the context of a superannuation entity\u2019s financial position;  \n12 When a benefit formula prescribes that members accrue materially higher levels of benefits as they near retirement age, the allocation of\nservice cost to reporting periods in accordance with the benefit formula would not provide a reliable measure of the employer\u2019s periodic\ncost of providing such benefits to employees, particularly in the earlier years of service. Accordingly, in such circumstances, AASB 119\nrequires employers to attribute defined benefits to reporting periods on a straight-line basis to more closely reflect the periodic cost of\nproviding such benefits to employees. Unlike employers, superannuation entities do not receive services from members in exchange for\nentitlements and it would be more relevant for a plan to attribute member benefits to reporting periods on a basis appropriate to the plan\u2019s\nparticular circumstances, taking into account the formal terms of the plan and any constructive obligations that go beyond the formal\nterms of the plan.  \n-----  (c) the amount of accrued benefits is relevant to an employer-sponsor that promises a future benefit,\nbut arguably less relevant if a plan limits its legal obligation to members to the amount of its assets\nnet of any obligations other than member liabilities;  \n(d) vested benefits can be a reasonable proxy for accrued benefits, particularly when members are close\nto expected retirement age; and  \n(e) measuring defined benefit member liabilities as vested benefits would be consistent with the\nproposed measurement of defined contribution member liabilities.  \nBC122 Other respondents to ED 179 expressed a preference for defined benefit member liabilities being measured\nin accordance with the approach in AASB 119 for defined benefit member liabilities, noting that such an\napproach:  \n(a) would facilitate greater consistency between employer-sponsor and superannuation entity financial\nstatements;  \n(b) would not impose significant additional preparation and audit costs on superannuation entities; and  \n(c) would be likely to yield a figure that is similar to the amount that would be calculated under ED 179\nbecause:  \n(i) expected administration costs are generally not material and not normally included in\ncalculating defined benefit member liabilities under AASB 119;  \n(ii) Superannuation Guarantee minimum benefits have meant few entities provide defined\nbenefit entitlements that accrue materially higher levels of benefits as members approach\nretirement age; and  \n(iii) most defined benefit member liabilities for employers are discounted using a rate\ndetermined on the basis of government bond yields, which would generally be consistent\nwith a risk-free rate.  \nBC123 However, the AASB noted the following drawbacks of requiring superannuation entities to measure defined\nbenefit member liabilities as vested benefits or in accordance with the approach in AASB 119.  \n(a) A vested benefits approach is inconsistent with the going concern concept because it is somewhat\nakin to a liquidation value and therefore not consistent with the long-term nature of defined benefit\nmember liabilities and the approaches required under Australian Accounting Standards for\nmeasuring similar liabilities, such as insurance contract liabilities.  \n(b) A superannuation plan with an employer-sponsor that applies AASB 119 may still incur additional\npreparation and audit costs in applying the approach in AASB 119 for defined benefit member\nliabilities where:  \n(i) the employer-sponsor\u2019s reporting date is different from the superannuation entity\u2019s\nreporting date; or  \n(ii) there is a multi-employer plan and the criteria in AASB 119 are met that enable the\nemployer-sponsor to account for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan.  \nBC124 The AASB also considered that measuring defined benefit member liabilities in accordance with the approach\nin AASB 119 for defined benefit member liabilities within the APRA reporting timeframe (within four\nmonths of period end) may pose challenges for some superannuation entities. However, the AASB decided\nnot to provide special guidance on materiality in respect of measuring defined benefit member liabilities to\nfacilitate plans meeting reporting deadlines because it would arguably need to be rules-based, which is\ncontrary to the AASB\u2019s general approach.  \nBC125 The AASB noted AASB 119 permits the use of particular estimates, averages or computational shortcuts in\nmeasuring defined benefit member liabilities in some cases. Accordingly, an entity would be permitted to\nuse those shortcuts that it considers appropriate (including, but not limited to, the shortcut techniques used by\nemployer-sponsors of defined benefit members under AASB 119), provided that the amount calculated using\nthe shortcut techniques is not materially different from the amount that would otherwise have been determined\nusing the comprehensive approach.  \nBC126 In light of the comments and recommendations of respondents, the AASB decided that, on cost-benefit\ngrounds, ED 223 should propose that a superannuation plan be required to measure its defined benefit member\nliabilities in accordance with the approach in AASB 119 (without modification) for defined benefit member\nliabilities.  \nBC127 In relation to ED 223, respondents reiterated many of the points made above in relation to the ED 179\nproposals. In particular, many regard the requirements in AASB 119 in respect of defined benefit member\nliabilities to be flawed and could identify costs of applying the AASB 119 model in a superannuation entity  \n-----  context and few benefits. In response, the AASB conducted further targeted outreach on the cost and\ntimeliness of implementing a principle similar to the requirements in AAS 25, but with more direction on its\nimplementation designed to overcome the short-comings of the AAS 25 requirement.  \nBC128 After noting that there is not a consistent approach across the various Australian Accounting Standards to\nmeasuring different types of liabilities and having regard to the nature of defined benefit member liabilities\nand the regulatory environment in which superannuation entities operate, the AASB concluded it should\nidentify a measurement principle for defined benefit member liabilities. That principle is to measure defined\nbenefit member liabilities as the amount of a portfolio of investments that would be needed as at the reporting\ndate to yield future net cash inflows that would be sufficient to meet accrued benefits at that date when they\nare expected to fall due.  \nBC129 The AASB noted this principle is consistent with the notion that the superannuation entity needs to fund the\nliability, taking into account the timing and probabilities attaching to various factors that reflect the\ncharacteristics of the members/beneficiaries. Those characteristics include expected mortality; rates of\nmember turnover, disability, and early retirement; salaries and rates of salary adjustment; member choices of\navailable options, such as lump sum or pension options; and any other risks specific to the liability. The\nAASB further concluded that it would require:  \n(a) expected cash flows to be discounted by a rate that reflects the expected notional returns, including\nfair value changes, on a portfolio of investments that is judged by the trustees to be the optimal way\nto generate the net cash inflows needed to meet benefit payments, based on a realistic assessment\nof the relative risks and returns on those assets;  \n(b) the relevant portfolio of investments might not be the same as the existing portfolio of investments,\nfor example, because the existing investments are currently in different asset classes, or the defined\nbenefit member liability is under-funded/unfunded; and  \n(c) to the extent the relevant portfolio of investments is not the same as the existing portfolio of\ninvestments, it would need to be based on investment opportunities that are realistically available\nto the entity.  \nBC130 The AASB acknowledged that, in applying the above measurement principle and the concept of materiality,\nthere would often be approaches to measuring defined benefit member liabilities that could be employed\nwhich do not involve undertaking a comprehensive actuarial assessment. For example, the AASB noted that\nvested benefit calculations, including an assessment of the relationship between vested benefits and accrued\nbenefits and the stability of that relationship, are the basis for some of the approaches that might be used in\npractice to measure defined benefit member liabilities for financial reporting purposes. However, the AASB\nnoted that, because of the varied circumstances facing different plans, it would be inappropriate to identify\nparticular approaches as being those that would apply in any particular cases.  \nBC131 The AASB discussed an alternative view that a risk-free rate representing only the time value of money should\nbe applied to present value expected cash outflows. The AASB noted that, although arguably facilitating\ncomparability among entities, this would tend to result in overstated defined benefit member liabilities and\ngive rise to up-front deficits that would later reverse.",

Both exposure drafts proposed disclosure of the main features of any specific contractual arrangement\nin place between the trustee and the relevant employer-sponsor in relation to funding a \u2018deficit\u2019. Both also\nmentioned in their Bases for Conclusions that, unless there is a specific contractual arrangement between the\nentity and employer-sponsor, the deficit would not in itself give rise to a receivable controlled by the entity.  \nBC139 Respondents to ED 179 and ED 223 confirmed the AASB\u2019s thinking that specific contractual arrangements\nbetween the entity and employer-sponsor are rarely, if ever, encountered. However, the AASB\u2019s targeted\noutreach with public sector superannuation entities revealed that legislative guarantees of funding are\nrelatively common in that sector. In addition, some respondents sought guidance on the circumstances in\nwhich a plan would recognise contributions receivable in respect of defined benefit members for which there\nis a deficit of net assets.  \nBC140 The AASB concluded that AASB 1056 should include a requirement to recognise a receivable from an\nemployer-sponsor to the extent that it meets the definition and recognition criteria for an asset in the\n_Framework._  \nBC141 The AASB considered the various approaches that could be taken to measuring such a receivable and\nconcluded that it should be measured on a basis consistent with the measurement principle for the underlying\ndefined benefit member liability less the fair value of any assets held by the entity to meet that liability, which\nis effectively the \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 of the asset. The AASB concluded that any other measurement principle\nfor an employer-sponsor receivable in respect of defined benefit member liabilities would be likely to involve\ntaking into account employer-sponsor credit risk, which would not be appropriate for the reasons identified\nin paragraph BC194(d) in relation to risk disclosure proposals.  \nBC142 A number of constituents commenting on the Draft AASB 105X for fatal-flaw review sought to know why\nthere would be no requirements in relation to whether entities should accrue for contributions receivable from\nemployers for payroll of the reporting period.

The AASB noted:  \n(a) AASB 112 prohibits discounting deferred tax assets and liabilities to their present values on the\nbasis that the detailed scheduling necessary to undertake that discounting is usually impracticable\nor highly complex;  \n-----  (b) a significant proportion of many superannuation entity tax balances are attributable to unrealised\ngains and losses on assets held to fund member benefits and measuring those assets at fair value\nhelps ensure that any associated tax balances determined under AASB 112 would be recognised at\namounts approximating fair value;[13] and  \n(c) most of the \u2018transaction costs\u2019 associated with tax balances relate to measuring the assets held to\nfund member benefits and maintaining adequate records for tax purposes, and the transaction costs\ndirectly attributable to extinguishing or settling a tax liability or tax asset are immaterial.  \nBC145 ED 179 and ED 223 proposed that superannuation entities should measure tax balances in accordance with\nAASB 112 because:  \n(a) users\u2019 needs do not appear to justify a departure from AASB 112 as the difference between a tax\nbalance measured at fair value or in accordance with AASB 112 would, in most cases, be\nimmaterial; and  \n(b) the benefits to users from fair valuing deferred tax assets and liabilities are unlikely to be\noutweighed by the costs incurred in determining their fair values.  \nBC146 The majority of the respondents to ED 179 and ED 223 that specifically commented on the recognition and\nmeasurement proposals for tax liabilities and tax assets generally agreed with the proposals. Accordingly,\nthe AASB concluded that superannuation entities should be required to measure tax balances in accordance\nwith AASB 112.",

        "page_content=": "### Liabilities and assets arising from insurance contracts  \nBC147 During its deliberations on the proposals in ED 179, the AASB noted many superannuation entities offer life\nand disability insurance cover to their members and some also offer income protection insurance, and that\nAAS 25 is silent about how to account for such arrangements. The AASB also noted the forms of these\ninsurance arrangements differ across entities, including those where cover is:  \n(a) offered to members, with the entity only acting as agent;  \n(b) offered to members with the entity accepting insurance risk; and  \n(c) provided to defined benefit members in relation to their projected retirement benefit.  \nBC148 The AASB noted that, in the case of (a), a superannuation entity is unlikely to be exposed to significant\ninsurance risk as members or their beneficiaries would not generally have recourse to the assets of the plan,\neven in the event the insurer fails. In other circumstances the entity may have significant insurance risk, even\nif it reinsures 100% of the risk with a third-party (re)insurer. The AASB noted that, under the insurance\nstandards, reinsurance does not nullify the direct contract with the policyholder.  \nBC149 The AASB considered a number of approaches to accounting for insurance arrangements that involve a\nsuperannuation entity having significant insurance risk, including applying AASB 137, AASB 4 Insurance\n_Contracts, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038._  \nBC150 The AASB considered that many of the insurance contracts entered into by superannuation entities would\nmeet the \u2018insurance contract\u2019 definition. The AASB decided ED 179 should propose that superannuation\nentities account for any liabilities and assets arising from the insurance arrangements they provide to their\nmembers by applying the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of AASB 1038 on the basis\nthat:  \n(a) insurance arrangements provided to superannuation members generally have the same\ncharacteristics as life insurance contracts and would meet the \u2018life insurance contract\u2019 definition\nwere it not for the fact that it is confined to contracts regulated under the Life _Insurance_ _Act_ _1995;_  \n(b) AASB 1038 has comprehensive requirements;  \n(c) AASB 4 does not include initial liability recognition requirements or comprehensive measurement\nrequirements;  \n(d) the liability recognition and measurement requirements of AASB 1023 are based on a premium\ndeferral model, which would not suit the circumstances of superannuation entities that would\ngenerally not receive significant premiums in advance that could be deferred; and  \n(e) AASB 137 applies only to liability recognition and measurement.  \n13 For example, if a superannuation entity sold an asset for its carrying amount at the end of the period, and that amount is above its tax\nbase, the tax liability measured in accordance with AASB 112 would generally be materially the same as the present value of tax the\nentity would have to pay in relation to the asset.  \n-----  BC151 The AASB noted that applying AASB 1038 would potentially change the way in which many superannuation\nentities account for insurance arrangements and, where the insurance arrangements give rise to obligations,\nentities would be required to recognise:  \n(a) insurance contract premiums and claim recoveries as income;  \n(b) insurance contract claims and premiums ceded to reinsurers as expenses;  \n(c) claim recoveries and other inflows not yet received from reinsurers as assets; and  \n(d) insurance contract liabilities.  \nBC152 In response to ED 179, a number of respondents acknowledged that a superannuation entity that:  \n(a) \u2018self-insures\u2019 members\u2019 benefits (that is, does not reinsure all of the members\u2019 insurance benefits\nwith a third-party insurer);  \n(b) pays discretionary insurance benefits in addition to the benefits provided by a third-party insurer;\nor  \n(c) is liable for insurance claims under its trust deeds that are not met by a third-party insurer;  \nis potentially exposed to insurance risk and therefore should arguably provide information regarding these\nrisks.  \nBC153 However, nearly all of those commenting on the proposed application of AASB 1038 expressed concerns,\nincluding:  \n(a) applying the recognition and measurement principles and requirements in AASB 1038 would be\ndifficult because:  \n(i) contributions in respect of self-insured defined benefit members do not include explicit\ninsurance premium components and, while a plan\u2019s actuary would normally estimate that\ncomponent for tax purposes, that may not meet the relevant requirements;  \n(ii) for some plans, a member\u2019s resignation benefits and death and/or disability benefits are\nlinked and would be included as part of the defined benefit member liability, with the\ndeath and/or disability component not being separately calculated; and  \n(iii) the amount of any self-insured defined death and/or disability benefit may not be readily\nidentifiable where the benefit is not defined in terms of an accrued (retirement) amount\nplus an insured component;  \n(b) the proposals are not justified on cost-benefit grounds, because:  \n(i) applying AASB 1038 would impose significant additional costs, including the cost of\nsystems for capturing the necessary information; and  \n(ii) insurance risks are generally not significant in the context of a superannuation entity\u2019s\noperations as a whole because few superannuation entities are self-insured; the provision\nof insurance arrangements is only an ancillary benefit offered to members; and most\nplans reinsure all of the relevant risks with third party (re)insurers; and  \n(c) the potential implications of the changes to AASB 1038 that would result from the IASB\u2019s\ncomprehensive insurance contracts project in the next few years.  \nBC154 Respondents to ED 179 also identified a number of alternative approaches the AASB could adopt, including:  \n(a) only addressing accounting for insurance arrangements in a superannuation context once the\nIASB\u2019s comprehensive insurance contracts project is completed;  \n(b) a disclosure-only approach, for example, requiring disclosure of the insurance arrangements\nprovided, the risk exposures and any reserves established in respect of such exposures; or  \n(c) requiring any liabilities or assets arising from insurance arrangements to be accounted for in a\nmanner consistent with the basis adopted for measuring member liabilities.  \nBC155 In redeliberating the proposals in ED 179, the AASB noted that, in many cases, superannuation entities act\nonly as agents in respect of the insurance arrangements they have for members and would not be affected by\nrequirements to account for insurance contracts. However, whilst insurance risks may not be significant for\nmany superannuation entities, the AASB noted that some may be exposed to significant insurance risk. For\nexample, (re)insuring member liabilities with a third-party (re)insurer may not mitigate the insurance risks to\nwhich a plan is exposed because:  \n-----  (a) the superannuation entity remains exposed to credit and other performance risk of the (re)insurer,\nincluding the possibility a reinsurer declines a claim but the entity remains obliged to meet the\nbenefit;  \n(b) the excesses and/or deductibles under a group policy might leave the entity exposed to some or all\nmembers\u2019 insurance claims; and/or  \n(c) the (re)insurer is in \u2018run off\u2019 and unwilling or unable to pay claims.  \nBC156 The AASB also noted that self-insured arrangements may expose an entity to non-performance risk and/or\neconomic dependency risk in relation to the employer-sponsor, particularly when there exists a deficit in a\ndefined benefit plan.  \nBC157 The AASB concluded that it should reconsider the accounting for the insurance arrangements once the IASB\u2019s\ncomprehensive insurance contracts project is completed, but that this should not be a barrier to addressing the\nmatter now. In its response to the IASB\u2019s ED/2010/8 Insurance _Contracts, the AASB recommended that the_\nIASB consider the implications of the findings on insurance contracts as a part of its proposed comprehensive\nreview of the accounting for post-employment benefits.  \nBC158 The AASB concluded a \u2018disclosure only\u2019 approach is not adequate because it would mean assets and liabilities\nwould remain unrecognised.  \nBC159 The AASB considers the main risks to which most superannuation entities are exposed in relation to insured\nbenefits are credit and operational risks of the (re)insurer, and risks associated with the plan administering\npolicies (such as the risk of higher than expected claims administration expenses).  \nBC160 The AASB also noted that:  \n(a) insurance contract liabilities in respect of defined benefit members are measured as part of\nmembers\u2019 accrued benefits under AAS 25;  \n(b) for the purpose of recognising a net defined benefit member liability under AASB 119, the level of\naggregation (unit of account) is the cohort of employees with defined benefit entitlements and any\ninsurance contract liabilities are calculated as a part of the \u2018best estimate\u2019 cash flows, which\ncontrasts with AASB 1038, which is designed to cater for life insurers and incorporates the notions\nof experience adjustments as well as adjusting planned margins for the impacts of changes to\nassumptions;  \n(c) insurance contract liabilities in respect of defined benefit members are likely to be measured at a\nsimilar amount under the accumulation approach in AASB 1038 as they would be under the\napproach in AASB 119 for defined benefit member liabilities;  \n(d) under AASB 119, no distinction is made between retirement benefits and insurance benefits in\nrespect of the measurement or presentation of defined benefit member liabilities; and  \n(e) an entity could use estimates, averages or computational shortcuts permitted in AASB 119 in\nmeasuring its defined benefit member liabilities, such as a cash premiums basis to measure the\ninsurance component of its liability to defined benefit members, or its liabilities arising from\ninsurance arrangements provided to defined contribution members, if the outcomes are not\nmaterially different from those that would otherwise be achieved using an expected present value\nbasis.  \nBC161 Accordingly, the AASB decided ED 223 should propose that insurance obligations to members be:  \n(a) recognised (and derecognised) using the AASB 119 approach for defined benefit member\nliabilities;  \n(b) for defined benefit members, measured as part of accrued benefits using the measurement approach\nin AASB 119 for defined benefit member liabilities;  \n(c) for defined contribution members, measured using the approach in AASB 119 for defined benefit\nmember liabilities, to facilitate consistency with the requirements for defined benefit member\nliabilities;  \n(d) presented separately from any liabilities for defined contribution members\u2019 vested benefits (when\nmaterial) \u2013 separate presentation should not be required in relation to defined benefit members\u2019\naccrued benefits, consistent with the approach in AASB 119; and  \n(e) any reinsurance assets should be recognised in accordance with AASB 1038.  \nBC162 The AASB also decided ED 223 should propose that information should be disclosed that explains and\nprovides users with a basis for understanding the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows arising\nfrom insurance obligations to members.  \n-----  BC163 In response to ED 223, a number of respondents made the following points:  \n(a) it is clear those superannuation entities that \u2018self-insure\u2019 should be accounting for any insurance\nassets and liabilities, and that AASB 119 is a reasonable basis for recognising and measuring the\nliabilities \u2013 it was noted that such self-insurance is becoming less prevalent;  \n(b) some superannuation entities clearly state that members will only receive insurance benefits if the\ninsurer/reinsurer pays. Accordingly, although superannuation entities may control cash and accrue\nreceivables and payables arising from their insurance arrangements, they are not taking on\ninsurance risk;  \n(c) those superannuation entities offering group insurance cover that members can elect to have would\nreinsure those risks with a registered insurer. In many of these arrangements it may not be entirely\nclear whether the superannuation entities are taking on insurance risk that should cause them to\naccount for insurance assets and liabilities;  \n(d) in most cases, the insurance offered to defined contribution members can be re-priced at short\nnotice. That is, the premiums charged to member accounts can be adjusted as the insurance costs\nfaced by the superannuation entities change (for example, as the reinsurance premiums change).\nAccordingly, in such cases, any insurance contracts that might exist between the superannuation\nentities and their members are short in duration and the associated insurance assets and liabilities\nmight be immaterial;  \n(e) superannuation entities occasionally make ex gratia payments in respect of death and disability\nclaims where the trustees judge that a benefit should be paid even though it is not covered by\nreinsurance, but they would not be material;  \n(f) referring to both AASB 119 and AASB 1038 in relation to insurance is potentially confusing,\nparticularly to those who are not familiar with accounting for insurance contract liabilities; and  \n(g) further guidance should be provided on when superannuation entities would be considered to be\nacting as agents.  \nBC164 The AASB concluded it should include the requirements relating to reinsurance assets from AASB 1038 in\nthe replacement standard, rather than referencing to AASB 1038; particularly in view of the fact that\nAASB 1038 will be replaced at some stage.  \nBC165 The AASB also concluded it should proceed with the other recognition and measurement requirements\nconsistent with the proposals in ED 223, but noted that it had concluded on an approach to measuring defined\nbenefit member liabilities, and therefore insurance liabilities, that is different from ED 223. The AASB also\nconcluded that further guidance should be provided on:  \n(a) factors that are indicative of a superannuation entity acting as an agent in respect of the insurance\ncover provided to members (or their beneficiaries); and  \n(b) factors that are indicative of a superannuation entity acting as an insurer.  \nBC166 The AASB noted that, in the case of superannuation entities acting as agents in relation to insurance\narrangements provided to members, whilst these arrangements do not give rise to revenues and expenses of\nthe entity, amounts from members account balances are typically applied to pay insurance premiums and\nsome claims may be received via member accounts. (Many claims would be received directly by\nmembers/beneficiaries and would not appear in a superannuation entity\u2019s financial statements.) The AASB\nconcluded that, in respect of the premium amounts and any claim amounts that flow through the\nsuperannuation entity, it provides useful information about insurance arrangements a superannuation entity\nprovides as an agent for the statement of cash flows and statement of changes in member benefits to reflect\nthose amounts.  \nBC167 In arriving at the above conclusions, the AASB was aware of the relatively new regulation designed to phase\nout so-called \u2018self-insurance\u2019 through prudential regulation. Nevertheless, the AASB concluded that the\nrequirements relating to recognising assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in relation to insurance\narrangements might still apply. This is because a superannuation entity that has insurance policies with\nregistered insurers that \u2018fully support\u2019 insurance cover provided to members may still leave the\nsuperannuation entity acting in the capacity of an insurer (albeit one with reinsurance cover).  \n-----  ",

Following the developments explained below, the IASB (and ultimately the AASB) changed the\nlandscape for consolidation when it decided to apply a different approach to \u2018investment entities\u2019 that,\ngenerally, would not require consolidation.  \nBC169 The AASB deliberated at length on the manner in which superannuation entities should prepare consolidated\nfinancial statements. Those deliberations were conducted prior to the issue of AASB 2013-5 Amendments to\n_Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Investment Entities. They included considering feedback on an AASB_\nConsultation Paper _Consolidation_ _of_ _Subsidiaries_ _by_ _Superannuation_ _Entities (September 2007) and the_\nconsolidation proposals in ED 179 and ED 223. During that process, the AASB considered a number of\ndifferent ways in which a parent superannuation entity could treat a subsidiary in its consolidated financial\nstatements, including:  \n(a) on a full fair value basis that involves all assets and liabilities, whether recognised or unrecognised\nin the separate financial statements of the parent or a subsidiary, being measured at fair values;  \n(b) on a basis that involves all assets and liabilities recognised by a subsidiary being measured at fair\nvalues when fair value is required or permitted under the relevant Australian Accounting\nStandards;[15]  \n(c) as per (b) above with the addition, when applicable, of a balancing item in relation to subsidiaries.[16]\nThat balancing item would comprise:  \n(i) acquired goodwill remaining at period end;  \n(ii) changes in internally generated goodwill associated with subsidiaries subsequent to their\nacquisition; and  \n(iii) measurement differences resulting from subsidiaries\u2019 assets and liabilities being\nrecognised in consolidated financial statements at amounts other than their fair values\nadjusted for transaction costs;  \n(d) in accordance with AASB 3 and AASB 127,[17] under which a subsidiary\u2019s identifiable assets and\nliabilities are recognised in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the\nsubsidiary\u2019s date of acquisition, and subsequent to acquisition, a subsidiary\u2019s assets and liabilities\nare recognised in accordance with relevant Australian Accounting Standards, which treat the fair\nvalues of assets or liabilities acquired in business combinations as \u2018cost\u2019 for the purposes of\nsubsequent accounting;  \n(e) a proportionate consolidation model that ensures the net asset amounts reported in the parent\u2019s\nseparate and consolidated financial statements are the same; and  \n(f) recognition of net investments in subsidiaries as a single line item with detailed note disclosure.  \nBC170 In relation to ED 179, the AASB decided that a parent superannuation entity would be best served by\nrecognising in its consolidated statement of financial position all assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, whether\nrecognised or unrecognised in the statement of financial position of the subsidiary.  \nBC171 In light of the comments received on ED 179 from respondents the AASB decided, consistent with ED 179,\nthat ED 223 should propose that a parent superannuation entity present consolidated financial statements.\nHowever, in contrast to ED 179, the consolidated financial statements would be prepared in accordance with\nAASB 3 and AASB 10, including in relation to accounting for acquired goodwill. Superannuation entities\nwould also be required to apply the fair value option to measuring non-controlling interests at inception,\nwithout subsequent remeasurement, in accordance with AASB 3.  \nBC172 Consistent with ED 179, under ED 223 it was proposed to require remeasuring acquired intangible assets at\nfair value at each reporting date in the consolidated financial statements; whether or not they had been\nacquired in a business combination. The AASB noted that this would be a departure from AASB 3 and\nAASB 138 Intangible Assets when there are not active markets for the intangible assets concerned.  \n14 AASB 10 superseded AASB 127 for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  \n15 Consistent with the approach currently applied under AASB 1023 and AASB 1038.  \n16 Similar to the approach in the now superseded AASB 1038 Life Insurance Business (1998).  \n17 AASB 10 had not yet been issued.  \n-----  BC173 At the time of preparing ED 223, the AASB also noted the proposals in IASB ED/2011/4 Investment _Entities[18]_\nto account for most subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss might address some of the concerns raised\nby constituents. However, the AASB decided that it would be premature for the AASB to propose in ED 223\npermitting or requiring parent superannuation entities to apply investment entity accounting before there is\nan outcome from the IASB\u2019s project.",

Many of them identified practical\ndifficulties, including:  \n(a) identifying entities controlled and the times when control arises or is lost;  \n(b) monitoring changes in holdings in collective investment entities, particularly when there is a high\nturnover of ownership interests in the investee;  \n(c) obtaining relevant, reliable and timely information to prepare consolidated financial statements,\nparticularly in relation to \u2018fund of fund\u2019 investment vehicles; and  \n(d) consolidating for only part of a period because the investment in the subsidiary fluctuates either\nside of a controlling level (say around 50%) in its outstanding ownership interests.  \nBC175 Based on these practical difficulties, some constituents recommended the AASB would need to provide\napplication guidance on how the concept of control should be interpreted and applied in a superannuation\ncontext. To this end, some suggested a \u2018substance over form\u2019 approach be taken whereby entities that a parent\n\u2018actively\u2019 controls are consolidated and entities in which there is a \u2018passive\u2019 investment be accounted for as\ninvestments.  \nBC176 Other respondents suggested that, due to the nature of superannuation arrangements in Australia, in some\ncircumstances the parent may be incapable of controlling an investee that would otherwise meet the definition\nof a subsidiary in a manner consistent with the notions of control in AASB 127 and AASB 10 because:  \n(a) members exercise investment choice and might collectively acquire a controlling interest in another\nentity, and the superannuation entity may not be considered to have the power to govern the\ninvestee so as to obtain benefits from its activities because the superannuation entity is subject to\nthe independent investment choice decisions of its members; and  \n(b) the \u2018sole purpose test\u2019 in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act is generally considered to\nprohibit trustees from being involved in day-to-day operations of the businesses in which their\nsuperannuation entities invest.  \nBC177 The AASB considered the concerns expressed in a superannuation context and noted that most, if not all, the\npractical difficulties identified are not unique to superannuation entities and are encountered by many other\nentities, including investment-type entities reporting under Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC178 A number of the respondents opposed parent superannuation entities being required to present consolidated\nfinancial statements on the grounds that users, particularly members, are unlikely to consider consolidated\ninformation useful. They noted that, unlike shareholders in a company, members of a superannuation entity\ndo not necessarily have a notional interest in all the net assets. In particular, some members may have no\nexposure to a subsidiary held by their superannuation entity because that investment is not part of some\nmembers\u2019 chosen investment options.  \nBC179 Some respondents to ED 223 noted their support for the proposals in IASB ED/2011/4 to account for most\nsubsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.",

In many circumstances, the disclosure requirements of Australian\nAccounting Standards would provide users of the financial statements of a superannuation entity with useful\ninformation for their decision making. However, some disclosure principles and requirements of those\nStandards may not facilitate the provision of useful information in a superannuation context. For example,\nAASB 116 Property, Plant _and_ _Equipment requires entities applying the revaluation model to disclose the_\ncarrying amount of each revalued class of property, plant and equipment as it would have been measured\nunder the cost model. However, there are very few circumstances in which users of superannuation entity\nfinancial statements might require historical cost information.  \nBC185 The AASB decided that ED 179 and ED 223 should propose the use of the disclosure requirements in many\nof the existing Australian Accounting Standards, but should also propose some disclosure principles that\nparticularly suit the superannuation environment, in place of the requirements of some of those other\nStandards.  \nBC186 Accordingly, ED 179 and ED 223 proposed that:  \n(a) a superannuation entity apply the disclosure principles and requirements in other applicable\nAustralian Accounting Standards unless they:  \n(i) are not consistent with the measurement requirements for superannuation entities; or  \n(ii) address the same items or events as the principles or requirements in the replacement\nStandard;  \n(b) superannuation-specific guidance in relation to the disclosure principles and requirements in other\nAustralian Accounting Standards be provided only where it is necessary to facilitate their reliable\nand consistent application; and  \n(c) a superannuation entity disclose information that provides users, particularly members and\nbeneficiaries, with a basis for understanding transactions and events specific to superannuation\nentities that are relevant to the users\u2019 decision making needs.  \n19 Refer to paragraph 32 of AASB 10 as amended by AASB 2013-5.  \n-----  ",

For example:  \n(a) superannuation entities are not permitted to issue compound financial instruments with multiple\nembedded derivatives;  \n(b) paragraphs 9 to 11 of AASB 7 are intended to help explain an entity\u2019s choice to designate financial\ninstruments at fair value through profit or loss,[20] whereas applying that measurement basis is the\nsubject of specific requirements;  \n(c) paragraphs 25 to 30 of AASB 7 do not seem relevant because financial assets and any financial\nliabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss; and for assets and liabilities relating to\nmember benefits, there are the challenges noted in paragraph BC114(b) about obtaining fair values;\nand  \n(d) superannuation entities generally do not have loans and are prohibited from holding a borrowing\ndirectly, and therefore accounting mismatches of related loans and liabilities are generally not\nrelevant.  \nBC194 In light of constituent feedback on ED 179, the AASB redeliberated the risk disclosure proposals and noted:  \n(a) the support for not requiring the application of paragraphs 6 to 30 of AASB 7 for the reasons in\nparagraph BC193;  \n(b) there may be less need for specific principles for superannuation entities regarding disclosures\nabout the nature and extent of risks than assumed for the purposes of ED 179;  \n20 The Bases for Conclusions to IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 suggest that paragraphs 9 to 11 of IFRS 7 are intended to address concerns\nabout how entities exercise their choice to designate financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.  \n-----  (c) although AASB 7 scopes out obligations arising from employee benefit plans to which AASB 119\napplies, a member liability meets the financial liability definition. This is because meeting\nmembers\u2019 benefits can be considered a contractual obligation of the superannuation entity (in the\nsense that defined contribution entitlements must be met and defined benefit entitlements are\nspecified in trust deeds), and members\u2019 benefits are normally paid in cash;  \n(d) information in relation to the risk an employer-sponsor of defined benefit members will not be able\nto make contributions at a level that would be expected to permit the superannuation entity to meet\nmembers\u2019 accrued benefits is of critical importance in understanding a superannuation entity\u2019s\noverall financial position (solvency), irrespective of whether there is a surplus or deficit, and such\nrisk is more in the nature of non-performance or economic dependency risk than credit risk; and  \n(e) additional liquidity risk disclosure about any non-financial liabilities other than tax liabilities of a\nsuperannuation entity can be justified on the basis that trustees are required to have an investment\nstrategy that has regard to the entity\u2019s overall circumstances, including the liquidity of its\ninvestments and its expected cash flow requirements. Accordingly, entities with non-financial\nliabilities other than tax liabilities (such as provisions) would be expected to have considered the\nrelevant liquidity risks and how they will be managed for prudential purposes. In this regard, the\nAASB noted that many superannuation entities would not have material non-financial liabilities\nother than those related to tax.  \nBC195 Based on its deliberations on the comments on ED 179, the AASB decided ED 223 should propose:  \n(a) a superannuation entity apply the principles and requirements in AASB 7, as appropriate, and\nshould only include guidance considered necessary to facilitate their application in a\nsuperannuation entity context;  \n(b) a superannuation entity make disclosures consistent with the types of information disclosed under\nAASB 7 in relation to the liquidity risks arising from any non-financial liabilities other than tax\nliabilities; and  \n(c) a superannuation entity with defined benefit members provide qualitative disclosures about nonperformance risk and/or economic dependency risk relating to the employer-sponsor(s).  \nBC196 Respondents to ED 223 expressed concerns that a requirement to disclose qualitative information about nonperformance risk and/or economic dependency risk to which the plan is exposed in relation to employersponsors would give rise to \u2018boilerplate\u2019 disclosure. This is because, in some cases, the trustees would have\nno more information about a superannuation entity\u2019s reliance on employer-sponsors than is already publicly\navailable and, in other cases, such a requirement might put the trustees in a position where they have to make\njudgements about the overall viability of an employer that may already be the subject of speculation in the\nbusiness community.  \nBC197 Some respondents suggested the disclosure should instead focus on the process superannuation entities use\nto assess risks associated with employer-sponsors, or provide information focusing on the funding plans of a\nsuperannuation entity in relation to defined benefits.  \nBC198 In relation to defined contribution member liabilities, the AASB concluded the disclosure principles in\nAASB 7 would be relevant. However, in relation to defined benefit member liabilities, the AASB considers\nmost of the disclosure principles in AASB 7 are not readily applicable, and concluded AASB 1056 should set\nout disclosure principles and related guidance on explaining the quantitative and/or qualitative information\nthat would be useful, including:  \n(a) how any funding deficit is expected to be met \u2013 in terms of the nature, causes of, and any strategies\nfor, addressing the deficit;  \n(b) the basis for assumptions and manner in which they are determined; and  \n(c) the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in key assumptions.  \nBC199 The AASB concluded that, consistent with the principles in AASB 7, the subject of the sensitivity disclosures\nshould be reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions, and when there is more than one key\nassumption for which a change is judged to be reasonably possible, the analysis can be performed on a\nunivariate basis or on a multivariate basis.  \nBC200 Given the obligations of trustees to have an investment strategy that has regard to the entity\u2019s overall\ncircumstances, including the liquidity of its investments and its expected cash flow requirements, the AASB\nalso concluded that, where the entity\u2019s actual investment portfolio differs from the portfolio used in measuring\ndefined benefit member liabilities, an explanation should be required of why that is the case.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "### Disaggregated financial information  \nBC201 Information about the way a superannuation entity arranges and manages assets attributable to different\ngroups of members, and the related member liabilities, can help provide users with a basis for understanding\nthe financial performance, financial position and risk exposures of the entity as a whole.  \nBC202 In framing its ED 179 proposals, the AASB decided the \u2018through the eyes of management\u2019 approach applied\nto operating segments under AASB 8 _Operating Segments would be an appropriate approach for_\nsuperannuation entities to apply in respect of disclosing information about assets attributable to different\ngroups of members and the related member liabilities because:  \n(a) whilst they generally do not have identifiable operating segments, some superannuation entities\nsegregate their assets into different member groups to facilitate meeting liabilities to those different\ngroups. Users would arguably benefit from these entities disclosing information about such asset\ngroups and the related member liabilities that corresponds to information provided in management\nreports;  \n(b) the approach is sufficiently generic to be applied in disclosing information about assets attributable\nto different member groups;  \n(c) the approach should be generally less costly to apply than alternative approaches because it uses\ninformation already generated for management\u2019s use; and  \n(d) the approach is consistent with that proposed for other disclosures, such as disclosures about risks\nand risk management arrangements.  \nBC203 Some respondents to ED 179 agreed with the principle of having segment disclosures, particularly if they\nresult in improved disclosures about risks attaching to different member groups. However, many other\nconstituents expressed concerns about requiring segment-type disclosures because such requirements would:  \n(a) make some entities\u2019 note disclosures excessively long and complex, thereby diminishing their\noverall usefulness; and  \n(b) not assist users in understanding the overall financial position and performance of an entity that has\nmember groups with different entitlements but \u2018pools\u2019 all its assets for investment purposes.  \nBC204 Of significance to many constituents were the potential practical implications of applying a segment-type\napproach in a superannuation context, including identifying segregated groups of assets. While trustees\ngenerally manage member liabilities on a segregated basis, most pool assets to achieve efficiencies. Some\nrespondents expressed concern that some relatively common situations that arise with pooled assets may\nnevertheless satisfy the criteria for managing assets on a segregated basis. For example, they were concerned\nentities that provide investment choices to members may be required to treat each investment choice as a\nsegregated asset group because entities\u2019 trustees might often:  \n(a) adjust actual allocations between asset classes within a particular investment option to match target\nallocations following movements in investment markets; and  \n(b) adjust actual allocations of assets between investment options to match member liabilities.  \nBC205 Others were concerned about applying the proposals to master trusts and multi-employer-sponsored plans,\nsome of which have in excess of 100 sub-plans, which comprise members with the same or related employersponsors. While trustees generally monitor the financial position of sub-plans in relation to defined benefit\nmembers on a regular basis, they do not monitor the financial performance of each sub-plan because a\nsignificant proportion of the plan\u2019s expenses are not capable of being reliably attributed to individual subplans. Accordingly, given the likely cost of determining, presenting and understanding this information, it is\nunlikely the ED 179 segment disclosure proposals would give rise to sufficient benefits in the context of\nmaster trusts and multi-employer-sponsored plans.  \nBC206 Others are keen to avoid duplication of effort, by aligning any segment-type disclosures with prudential\nreporting requirements.  \nBC207 Based on responses to ED 179, the AASB:  \n(a) noted that a significant number of superannuation entities are managed by their trustees on a\nsegmented basis, although segmentation will often not be clear from the way the entity\u2019s assets are\nmanaged;  \n(b) decided that disaggregated financial disclosures would provide useful information for users,\nparticularly for hybrid entities because they are exposed to different types and levels of risks; and  \n(c) decided that there is a need to mitigate the practical issues identified by constituents.  \n-----  BC208 The AASB noted that requiring superannuation entities to provide disaggregated disclosures on the basis of\nmember groups would facilitate a hybrid superannuation entity providing risk-based disclosures in respect of\nits liabilities to the different classes of members and it would potentially address some concerns of\nconstituents around investment options and sub-plans being the subject of disaggregated disclosure.\nHowever, disaggregated disclosures may, for example, not be useful for showing how a hybrid plan with a\nsmall number of defined benefit members arranges and manages activities.  \nBC209 The AASB also noted that requiring the use of the principles and requirements in AASB 8, as appropriate,\nmight have drawbacks, including:  \n(a) some of the terms used in AASB 8 may be ambiguous or irrelevant in a superannuation context.\nFor example, a characteristic of an operating segment is that its operating results are regularly\nreviewed by the entity\u2019s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resource\nallocations. However, some could interpret this to mean that investment options are not operating\nsegments because members generally decide how the assets of the plan are allocated; and  \n(b) some entities may provide only limited segment information under the principles and requirements\nin AASB 8, even when they have both defined contribution and defined benefit members because\nthe operating results regularly reviewed by the trustees do not distinguish between the two groups\nof members or their related assets.  \nBC210 Based on these considerations, the AASB decided ED 223 should propose that a superannuation entity provide\ndisaggregated disclosures in accordance with the principles and requirements in AASB 8, except where it is\nappropriate to modify the requirements for application in a superannuation context. This was intended to\nprovide trustees with more flexibility and enable them to provide disaggregated information that reflects the\nmanner in which they arrange and manage the assets and liabilities of their entity.  \nBC211 In coming to these proposals, the AASB noted paragraph 19 of AASB 8 comments that there may be a\npractical limit to the number of reportable segments an entity separately discloses beyond which segment\ninformation may become too detailed.  \nBC212 Respondents to ED 223 raised many of the same concerns with the proposals as were expressed in relation to\nthe ED 179 proposals.  \nBC213 In redeliberating its approach, the AASB noted that the role of a trustee in a superannuation entity differs\nfrom the role of a chief operating decision maker in the context of AASB 8, and the main focus in a\nsuperannuation entity context should be on information about different categories of members. Accordingly,\nthe AASB concluded there should be no specific disaggregated information disclosure requirements, but there\nshould be a general requirement to disclose disaggregated information when that would help to explain the\nrisks to which different categories of members are exposed.",

The AASB noted some users\nmight consider the amount of benefit cost for a period to be useful in providing an indication of the recurring\ncost to the superannuation entity of providing defined benefit entitlements. The AASB also noted some users\nmight consider the amount of any actuarial gains and losses for a period to be useful information as it provides\nan indication of how accurately the superannuation plan has estimated the key determinants of defined benefit\nmembers\u2019 accrued benefits. However, the AASB also noted information about the components of\nremeasurement changes in defined benefit member liabilities might be regarded as relatively more useful in\nan employer-sponsor context.

        "page_content=": "### Insurance contracts  \nBC232 The AASB included proposed disclosure requirements in ED 179 and ED 223 to complement the proposed\nrecognition and measurement requirements relating to insurance arrangements a superannuation entity\nprovides to its members. Constituents\u2019 comments on the ED 179 and ED 223 proposals tended to focus on\nthe recognition and measurement issues, however, the constituents comment on the Draft AASB 1056 for\nfatal flaw review included feedback on the disclosure issues.  \nBC233 Based on the feedback received, the AASB concluded that a superannuation entity taking on the role of an\ninsurer in relation to its defined contribution members should separately disclose in their financial statements\nitems such as:  \n(a) insurance contract revenue, incurred claims expense, reinsurance expense and reinsurance\nrecoveries recognised in the income statement;  \n(b) insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contract assets recognised in the statement of financial\nposition; and  \n(c) insurance contract cash inflows, reinsurance contract cash outflows, claims cash outflows and\nreinsurance recoveries cash inflows recognised in the statement of cash flows.  \nBC234 In relation to defined benefit members, the AASB noted that, depending on the conditions set out in the\nrelevant trust deed, those members (or their beneficiaries) might be promised, for example, a lump sum benefit\non retirement or resignation, a lump sum benefit on death or disablement, a pension on retirement for their\nremaining lifetime and/or a pension for the remaining lifetime of a spouse, and the pension may or may not  \n-----  be indexed in some way. The AASB noted that the defined benefit member liability is effectively the sum of\nthe expected values associated with the various ways in which members might be paid their benefits, and can\nbe regarded as a single item made up of inter-related components. Accordingly, the AASB concluded that\nliabilities and assets arising from insurance arrangements a superannuation entity provides to defined benefit\nmembers need not be presented separately from the entity\u2019s liabilities for such members\u2019 benefits in the\nstatement of financial position. Furthermore, unless there are explicit direct premiums, claims, reinsurance\npremiums or claim recoveries relating to insurance risks, the AASB concluded that amounts relating to\ninsurance arrangements a superannuation entity provides to defined benefit members need not be presented\nseparately in the income statement, statement of changes in member benefits or statement of cash flows.",

In addition, the AASB decided that some of the terms and phrases defined in AAS 25 are no\nlonger necessary.  \nBC236 Consistent with its current policies, the AASB decided:  \n(a) there is no need to define terms in AASB 1056 that are defined elsewhere or are similar to terms\ndefined elsewhere in Australian Accounting Standards, such as \u2018general purpose financial report\u2019\nand \u2018reporting date\u2019; and  \n(b) to include in AASB 1056 definitions of specific relevance in a superannuation entity context, such\nas \u2018defined contribution member\u2019 and \u2018defined benefit member\u2019 based on the AAS 25 definitions\nfor \u2018defined contribution plan\u2019 or \u2018defined benefit plan\u2019 (which themselves are not included in\nAASB 1056 because that entity-based dichotomy is no longer relevant).",

        "page_content=": "### Other issues raised on definitions  \nBC237 In ED 179, the AASB proposed that:  \n(a) the definition of the term \u2018vested benefits\u2019 should be based on the definition of the same term in\nAASB 119, but amended to reflect the nature of such benefits in a superannuation context; and  \n(b) the term \u2018accrued benefits\u2019 should be defined broadly to cover both defined contribution and\ndefined benefit arrangements.  \nBC238 Several respondents to ED 179 raised concerns with the applicability of the definition of vested benefits in\nthe context of defined benefit members. The AASB noted, for a superannuation entity with only defined\ncontribution members, the amount of its member liabilities may not change as a consequence of the timing or\ncircumstances of a member\u2019s departure (for example, resignation, retrenchment or retirement). However,\ndepending on the relevant trust deed, different timing or circumstances may give rise to different entitlements\nfor defined benefit members. Accordingly, in ED 223 the AASB proposed the definition of vested benefits\nbe amended to clarify that:  \n(a) vested benefits are the benefits a member would be entitled to on voluntary withdrawal from their\nsuperannuation entity at the end of the period; and  \n(b) in the context of defined benefit members\u2019 vested benefits, the term \u2018withdrawal\u2019 could be\ninterpreted to mean voluntary withdrawal by the member from either the defined benefit section of\nthe entity or from the entity itself.  \nBC239 One respondent to ED 179 noted the proposed \u2018defined benefit member\u2019 definition did not identify the\nemployer-sponsor\u2019s responsibility for investment risk as a distinguishing feature, and is not adequately\ndistinguished from defined contribution members. However, the AASB was not persuaded by this view\nbecause investment risk is not a defining characteristic of such arrangements, for example, for employersponsors of unfunded defined benefit public sector schemes.",

        "page_content=": "### Effective date and transition on initial application  \nBC240 The AASB noted that, given the extent of the changes, unless comparative information is prepared on the\nsame basis as the current period information in the year of transition, the comparative information would not\nbe useful. Accordingly, the AASB concluded the AASB 1056 requirements should be applied retrospectively\nin accordance with paragraphs 19 to 27 of AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates  \n-----  _and Errors and, therefore, the comparative information on transition should be prepared on the basis of the_\nAASB 1056 requirements.  \nBC241 The AASB considered the time that superannuation entities would need to adjust their financial reporting\nsystems in order to transition from applying the requirements of AAS 25 to applying the requirements of\nAASB 1056. In particular, the AASB noted the changes that might need to be made by superannuation\nentities with defined benefit members liabilities and entities that are so-called \u2018paragraph 66 plans\u2019 (also see\nparagraph BC34).  \nBC242 In light of the expected financial reporting impacts on superannuation entities of replacing AAS 25 with\nAASB 1056 and the need to present comparative information in accordance with AASB 1056, the AASB\nconsidered that there should be a period of at least two years between the making of AASB 1056 and its\nmandatory application date. In particular, the AASB noted that, for superannuation entities that undertake a\ncomprehensive valuation of some or all of their defined benefit member liabilities on a triennial basis, it might\nbe most practicable for there to be at least three year-ends (including the comparative year-end) between the\nmaking of AASB 1056 and the year-end relating to the mandatory application date.  \nBC243 The AASB also noted that paragraph 10(f) of AASB 101 would generally require a statement of financial\nposition to be presented for the beginning of the earliest comparative period, which based on the thinking in\nparagraph BC242 would mean a mandatory application date of 1 July 2017. The AASB considers this to be\nan excessively long time to elapse before the mandatory application date and concluded that:  \n(a) the mandatory application date should be annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July\n2016; and  \n(b) superannuation entities should be specifically exempted from presenting a statement of financial\nposition as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for which information is included in\nits financial statements when they transition to AASB 1056.",

As a part of its terms of reference, the Review considered issues in\nrelation to the fees, costs and investment returns of superannuation entities, and improving transparency\naround these items through reporting to advisers, researchers, analysts, regulators and members.  \nBC245 The Review Panel concluded that the Australian superannuation system currently lacks transparency,\ncomparability and accountability in relation to costs, fees and investment returns. It also concluded that,\nwhile the proposals in ED 179 would improve financial reporting by superannuation plans, they would not\nmaterially improve the information required by individual users, particularly individual members.  \nBC246 The Review Panel considered the superannuation industry and members are more concerned about the\nperformance of the investment options in which they are invested than the whole-of-fund information required\nby AAS 25. It also noted a perceived disconnect between the information provided by superannuation entities\nin GPFSs and the information needs of users, particularly members, which would be unlikely to be rectified\nunder the proposals in ED 179. However, there was an acknowledgement by the Review Panel that a plan\nmember can be affected by factors impacting on their plan as a whole.[21]  \nBC247 The AASB considered the Panel\u2019s findings and noted, even though the GPFSs of superannuation entities are\nnot targeted at each member\u2019s particular interest, the whole-of-fund financial information is useful to\nmembers and other users for their decision making.  \nBC248 In addition, the AASB concluded financial statements play an important role within the current regulatory\narrangements by providing a basis for information reported in trustees\u2019 annual reports to members and\nmembers\u2019 individual benefit statements, even though these would not include the same level of disclosure or\nnecessarily have been audited. Consequently, under the current arrangements financial statements are a key\nmedium through which trustees discharge their accountability responsibilities.  \nBC249 The Stronger Super reforms implemented from 1 July 2013 are the government response to the Review\nrecommendations and the AASB has monitored those reforms and, where relevant, considered them in\ndeveloping AASB 1056.  \n21 As noted in the Review Panel\u2019s Final Report (page 173) \u201c\u2026 during the GFC, previously liquid assets held by some superannuation funds\nbecame illiquid due to capital freezes in mortgage, cash management and property trusts. In order to meet portability, switching and\ncapital drawdown requests, some trustees were forced to sell equities into a depressed market, while trustees who were unable to meet\nthese requests applied to APRA for a variation or suspension of portability requirements.\u201d  \n-----  ",

In doing so, the AASB noted AASB 107 requires entities to:_  \n(i) disclose a reconciliation of cash flows arising from operating activities to profit or loss;  \n(ii) report cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities on a gross basis; and  \n(iii) disclose non-cash investing and financing transactions in a way that provides relevant\ninformation about such transactions;  \n(c) risk-based disclosures in relation to asset concentrations and sensitivity analyses;  \n(d) disclosures in relation to business, non-financial and emerging risks;  \n(e) disclosures in relation to information about reserves;  \n(f) how a superannuation entity\u2019s tax liability for a period might be allocated between the income\nstatement and the statement of changes in member benefits, particularly since the _Income_ _Tax_\n_Assessment_ _Act_ _1997 does not generally distinguish between income tax on investment earnings_\nand tax on contributions The AASB noted that superannuation entities would currently need to\ndistinguish between tax on earnings and tax attributable to contributions in order to determine\nmember benefits and that non-superannuation entities are required to perform similar calculations\nunder other Australian Accounting Standards;  \n(g) facilitating separate presentation of realised and unrealised gains and losses. The AASB noted that\nsuperannuation entities would not be prevented from presenting or disclosing such additional\ninformation if it provides useful information to users of its financial statements;  \n(h) presentation of \u2018netted off\u2019 revenue and expense items, particularly in relation to entities conducting\ntheir investment arrangements through investment managers and/or custodians;  \n(i) circumstances in which contributions in respect of defined contribution members should be\nrecognised on an accrual basis or a cash basis; and  \n(j) circumstances in which benefits payable would be disclosed as a current liability. The AASB noted\nthat AASB 101 has relevant criteria for distinguishing between current and non-current liabilities.  \nBC251 The AASB concluded that the issues underlying some of those concerns:  \n(a) are outside the scope of general purpose financial reporting;  \n(b) are dealt with in other Australian Accounting Standards; and/or  \n(c) arise under other Australian Accounting Standards and are dealt with by non-superannuation\nentities without additional guidance.  \nThe AASB also noted that providing superannuation-specific guidance on the application of the principles\nand requirements in other Australian Accounting Standards would run the risk of interpreting IFRS principles\nand requirements in a way that is not consistent with the way they are interpreted in other contexts.  \nBC252 Some respondents raised issues about better identifying the \u2018reporting entity\u2019 in a superannuation industry\ncontext. They noted that, in the private sector, Registrable Superannuation Entities (RSE) would typically be\nthe entities that apply AAS 25 and would apply AASB 1056, but that this may not be the appropriate entity\nlevel at which general purpose financial reporting should take place. At this stage, the AASB concluded that\nthis topic would need to be the subject of future research (refer to paragraph BC2).  \n-----  ",
