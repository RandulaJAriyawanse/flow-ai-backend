This Standard provides guidance on the determination of cost and its\nsubsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to net realisable value. It also provides\nguidance on the cost formulas that are used to assign costs to inventories.",

They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are\nincurred in converting materials into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are those indirect costs of\nproduction that remain relatively constant regardless of the volume of production, such as depreciation and\nmaintenance of factory buildings, equipment and right-of-use assets used in the production process, and the\ncost of factory management and administration. Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of\nproduction that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production, such as indirect materials\nand indirect labour.  \n13 The allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of\nthe production facilities. Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a\nnumber of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting\nfrom planned maintenance. The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity.\nThe amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low\nproduction or idle plant. Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are\nincurred. In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of\nproduction is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost. Variable production overheads are\nallocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.  \n14 A production process may result in more than one product being produced simultaneously. This is the case,\nfor example, when joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a by-product. When the\ncosts of conversion of each product are not separately identifiable, they are allocated between the products\non a rational and consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative sales value of\neach product either at the stage in the production process when the products become separately identifiable,\nor at the completion of production. Most by-products, by their nature, are immaterial. When this is the case,\nthey are often measured at net realisable value and this value is deducted from the cost of the main product.\nAs a result, the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different from its cost.",

This\nis the appropriate treatment for items that are segregated for a specific project, regardless of whether they\nhave been bought or produced. However, specific identification of costs is inappropriate when there are\nlarge numbers of items of inventory that are ordinarily interchangeable. In such circumstances, the method\nof selecting those items that remain in inventories could be used to obtain predetermined effects on profit or\nloss.  \n**25** **The cost of inventories, other than those dealt with in paragraph 23, shall be assigned by using the**\n**first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost formula. An entity shall use the same cost formula**\n**for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity. For inventories with a different**\n**nature or use, different cost formulas may be justified.**  \n26 For example, inventories used in one operating segment may have a use to the entity different from the\nsame type of inventories used in another operating segment. However, a difference in geographical location\nof inventories (or in the respective tax rules), by itself, is not sufficient to justify the use of different cost\nformulas.  \n27 The FIFO formula assumes that the items of inventory that were purchased or produced first are sold first,\nand consequently the items remaining in inventory at the end of the period are those most recently\npurchased or produced. Under the weighted average cost formula, the cost of each item is determined from\nthe weighted average of the cost of similar items at the beginning of a period and the cost of similar items\npurchased or produced during the period. The average may be calculated on a periodic basis, or as each\nadditional shipment is received, depending upon the circumstances of the entity.",

The cost of inventories may also not be\nrecoverable if the estimated costs of completion or the estimated costs to be incurred to make the sale have\nincreased. The practice of writing inventories down below cost to net realisable value is consistent with the\nview that assets should not be carried in excess of amounts expected to be realised from their sale or use.  \n29 Inventories are usually written down to net realisable value item by item. In some circumstances, however,\nit may be appropriate to group similar or related items. This may be the case with items of inventory\nrelating to the same product line that have similar purposes or end uses, are produced and marketed in the\nsame geographical area, and cannot be practicably evaluated separately from other items in that product\nline. It is not appropriate to write inventories down on the basis of a classification of inventory, for example,\nfinished goods, or all the inventories in a particular operating segment.  \n30 Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates\nare made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realise. These estimates take into consideration  \n-----  fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period to the extent that\nsuch events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.  \n31 Estimates of net realisable value also take into consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held.\nFor example, the net realisable value of the quantity of inventory held to satisfy firm sales or service\ncontracts is based on the contract price. If the sales contracts are for less than the inventory quantities held,\nthe net realisable value of the excess is based on general selling prices. Provisions may arise from firm sales\ncontracts in excess of inventory quantities held or from firm purchase contracts. Such provisions are dealt\nwith under AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.  \n32 Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if\nthe finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. However,\nwhen a decline in the price of materials indicates that the cost of the finished products exceeds net realisable\nvalue, the materials are written down to net realisable value. In such circumstances, the replacement cost of\nthe materials may be the best available measure of their net realisable value.  \n33 A new assessment is made of net realisable value in each subsequent period. When the circumstances that\npreviously caused inventories to be written down below cost no longer exist or when there is clear evidence\nof an increase in net realisable value because of changed economic circumstances, the amount of the writedown is reversed (ie the reversal is limited to the amount of the original write-down) so that the new\ncarrying amount is the lower of the cost and the revised net realisable value. This occurs, for example, when\nan item of inventory that is carried at net realisable value, because its selling price has declined, is still on\nhand in a subsequent period and its selling price has increased.",

The treatment of items in the nature of inventories that were not held for sale needed to be determined\nby analogy because they were not explicitly covered by AASB 1019.  \nBC2 Inventories held for distribution by not-for-profit entities were scoped into AASB 102, issued in July 2004,\nand were required to be measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost.  \nBC3 This is the same as the requirement in the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board\u2019s\nIPSAS 12 _Inventories issued in July 2001. (IPSAS 12 has since been revised in December 2006 for_\napplication from 1 January 2008.)  \nBC4 The Board notes that inventories held for distribution do not include major spare parts and stand-by\nequipment that qualify as property, plant and equipment, which are discussed in AASB 116 Property, Plant\n_and Equipment at paragraphs 8 and 12._",

        "page_content=": "## Background relating to key issue  \nBC5 A number of constituents raised issues with the Board relating to the conceptual soundness of applying the\nlower of cost and current replacement cost treatment to inventories held for distribution as well as the\npracticality of its application to certain types of inventories held for distribution.  \nBC6 The Board considered the view that writing down inventory held for distribution when its current\nreplacement cost falls below cost may result in the recognition of impairments when the service potential to\nthe entity of those inventories remains unchanged. In addition, the Board noted that the service potential to\nthe entity of inventories held for distribution may fall, but that current replacement cost to the entity may\nremain higher than the original cost. The Board concluded that this is in part because the lower of cost and\ncurrent replacement cost requirement focuses on financial values, whereas the service potential of\ninventories held for distribution by many not-for-profit entities is considered in physical terms.  \nBC7 The Board also considered the practical problem that current replacement costs are sometimes not readily\navailable for many of the inventories held for distribution that have long lives because they have not been\nreplenished for long periods. In some cases, such inventories may have maintained their service potential,\nbut may no longer be available in the form held by the entity.  \nBC8 The Board noted that a for-profit entity will readily know its costs and its net realisable values, because\nmost businesses buy and sell inventories regularly. In a not-for-profit entity that holds inventories for\ndistribution and buys and distributes them regularly, the lower of cost and current replacement cost\nrequirement has been viewed as the nearest available equivalent requirement.  \nBC9 The Board noted that the practical problems emerge when the inventories held for distribution are retained\nover the long term and replacement costs are not readily available. A major part of the burden is the\npossible need to maintain records of three prices for each type of inventory: (1) the cost; (2) the up-to-date\nreplacement cost in case there is a need for write down; and (3) in the event that the replacement cost has\npreviously fallen below cost, that replacement cost [carrying amount]. The Board also noted that the\nrecords of the three prices might also need to be maintained to facilitate the reversal of write downs in the\nevent that the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down below cost no longer\nexist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in current replacement cost because of changed\neconomic circumstances.",

        "page_content=": "## Cost adjusted when applicable for any loss of service potential  \nBC12 The Board noted that the lower of cost and net realisable value requirement in AASB 102 in respect of\ninventories other than those held for distribution can be viewed as being based on a notion of recognising a\nloss of service potential in a for-profit environment. That is, an entity that seeks to sell inventories for more\nthan they cost generally considers the service potential of those inventories in financial terms. If net\nrealisable value falls below cost, the entity can be viewed as suffering a loss of service potential.  \nBC13 The Board observed that the lower of cost and current replacement cost requirement for measuring\ninventories held for distribution by not-for-profit entities can be viewed as seeking to emulate the approach\ntaken for other inventories and its focus is also on a loss of value in financial terms. However, the Board\nconsidered that this financial measure of the loss of service potential may not always be the most relevant\nmeasure in respect of inventories held for distribution by not-for-profit entities for the reasons outlined in\nparagraph BC6.  \nBC14 The Board considered that the measurement of inventories held for distribution by not-for-profit entities at\ncost, adjusted when applicable for any loss of service potential, is consistent with the _Framework for the_\n_Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, which notes at paragraph Aus49.1:_  \nIn respect of not-for-profit entities in the public or private sector, in pursuing their objectives,\ngoods and services are provided that have the capacity to satisfy human wants and needs. Assets\nprovide a means for entities to achieve their objectives. Future economic benefits or service\npotential is the essence of assets. Future economic benefits is synonymous with the notion of\nservice potential, and is used in this Framework as a reference also to service potential. Future\neconomic benefits can be described as the scarce capacity to provide benefits to the entities that\nuse them, and is common to all assets irrespective of their physical or other form.  \nBC15 The Board noted that a fall in the current replacement cost of inventories held for distribution may at times\nindicate a loss of service potential, but that this is not necessarily always the case, and that a loss of service\npotential may at times be identified on other, more relevant, bases. For example, obsolescence, which may\noccur with or without there being a fall in current replacement cost, may be the main factor leading to a loss\nof service potential for many not-for-profit entities. The term \u2018obsolescence\u2019 covers both \u2018technical\nobsolescence\u2019 and \u2018functional obsolescence\u2019. Technical obsolescence occurs when an item still functions\nfor some or all of the tasks it was originally acquired to do, but no longer matches existing technologies.\nFunctional obsolescence occurs when an item no longer functions the way it did when it was first acquired.\nIn either case, a loss of service potential may need to be recognised.  \nBC16 The Board also considered that a problem with a purely physical service potential approach is identifying\nways in which physical service potential would be measured. However, the Board concluded that many\nnot-for-profit entities will often be more likely to monitor the service potential of their inventories held for\ndistribution than they are to monitor the current replacement costs of those inventories. The Board\nconsidered that this is especially likely to be the case when those inventories are important to maintaining\nits functions or operating capability and, therefore, often in cases when it is most likely to be material to the\nfinancial statements.  \nBC17 The Board considers that there is a need for the circumstances of a not-for-profit entity to be the\ndetermining factor behind its manner of assessing any loss of service potential for inventories held for\ndistribution. The measurement requirement for inventories held for distribution would require each not-forprofit entity to identify the basis (or bases) for determining any loss of service potential that best suits the\ncircumstances relating to the entity. Different bases may apply to different inventories held for distribution\nwithin the same entity.  \nBC18 There was considerable support for the approach of requiring inventories held for distribution to be\nmeasured at cost, adjusted for any loss of service potential, in the submissions on Exposure Draft ED 154\n_Proposed Amendments to AASB 102 \u2013 Inventories Held for Distribution by Not-for-Profit Entities._\nHowever, some submissions expressed concerns that the lower of cost and current replacement cost  \n-----  requirement is being applied without difficulty by many entities and argued that it might be unnecessarily\ndisruptive to introduce the change proposed in ED 154.  \nBC19 The Board noted that a current replacement cost that is lower than cost might be a common way of\nidentifying and measuring a loss of service potential for inventories held for distribution. Accordingly,\nmany entities are likely to continue their existing practices under a revised AASB 102, and the Board\nconcluded few entities would be disrupted by the change.  \nBC20 The Board concluded that the requirement to measure inventories held for distribution at cost, adjusted\nwhen applicable for any loss of service potential, would give rise to more relevant information that better\nreflects the various accountabilities of not-for-profit entities. In addition, the Board concluded that the\nrequirement is likely to be more appropriate in practical terms than the former requirement in some\ncircumstances.",

The Board concluded that, on transition to\nthe changed requirement, it is appropriate to require not-for-profit entities to adjust any difference\nprospectively against opening retained earnings and not amend comparative information on the basis that:  \n(a) there are likely to be practical problems associated with trying to retrospectively determine\nwhether there have been further losses of service potential and precisely when they occurred,\nwhich may not be overcome by the impracticability override in AASB 108 Accounting Policies,\n_Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors;_  \n(b) the relatively short period of development involved in amending AASB 102 and, therefore, the\nabsence of a long period during which constituents would be made aware of the changes; and  \n(c) requiring rather than permitting the prospective transitional approach is desirable from a\ncomparability viewpoint.  \n-----  ",
