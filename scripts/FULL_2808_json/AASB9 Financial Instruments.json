These include:  \n(a) when the terms of the contract permit either party to settle it net in cash or another financial\ninstrument or by exchanging financial instruments;  \n(b) when the ability to settle net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial\ninstruments, is not explicit in the terms of the contract, but the entity has a practice of settling\nsimilar contracts net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial\ninstruments (whether with the counterparty, by entering into offsetting contracts or by selling the\ncontract before its exercise or lapse);  \n(c) when, for similar contracts, the entity has a practice of taking delivery of the underlying and\nselling it within a short period after delivery for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term\nfluctuations in price or dealer\u2019s margin; and  \n(d) when the non-financial item that is the subject of the contract is readily convertible to cash.  \nA contract to which (b) or (c) applies is not entered into for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the nonfinancial item in accordance with the entity\u2019s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements and,\naccordingly, is within the scope of this Standard. Other contracts to which paragraph 2.4 applies are\nevaluated to determine whether they were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt\nor delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity\u2019s expected purchase, sale or usage\nrequirements and, accordingly, whether they are within the scope of this Standard.  \n2.7 A written option to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial\ninstrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, in accordance with paragraph 2.6(a) or 2.6(d) is within\nthe scope of this Standard. Such a contract cannot be entered into for the purpose of the receipt or delivery\nof the non-financial item in accordance with the entity\u2019s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.",

Hence, an entity first consolidates all subsidiaries in accordance with AASB 10 and\nthen applies those paragraphs to the resulting group.  \n**3.2.2** **Before evaluating whether, and to what extent, derecognition is appropriate under paragraphs 3.2.3\u2013**\n**3.2.9, an entity determines whether those paragraphs should be applied to a part of a financial asset**\n**(or a part of a group of similar financial assets) or a financial asset (or a group of similar financial**\n**assets) in its entirety, as follows.**  \n**(a)** **Paragraphs 3.2.3\u20133.2.9 are applied to a part of a financial asset (or a part of a group of**\n**similar financial assets) if, and only if, the part being considered for derecognition meets**\n**one of the following three conditions.**  \n-----  **(i)** **The part comprises only specifically identified cash flows from a financial asset**\n**(or a group of similar financial assets). For example, when an entity enters into an**\n**interest rate strip whereby the counterparty obtains the right to the interest cash**\n**flows, but not the principal cash flows from a debt instrument, paragraphs 3.2.3\u2013**\n**3.2.9 are applied to the interest cash flows.**  \n**(ii)** **The part comprises only a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of the cash flows**\n**from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets). For example, when**\n**an entity enters into an arrangement whereby the counterparty obtains the rights**\n**to a 90 per cent share of all cash flows of a debt instrument, paragraphs 3.2.3\u2013**\n**3.2.9 are applied to 90 per cent of those cash flows. If there is more than one**\n**counterparty, each counterparty is not required to have a proportionate share of**\n**the cash flows provided that the transferring entity has a fully proportionate**\n**share.**  \n**(iii)** **The part comprises only a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of specifically**\n**identified cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets).**\n**For example, when an entity enters into an arrangement whereby the**\n**counterparty obtains the rights to a 90 per cent share of interest cash flows from a**\n**financial asset, paragraphs 3.2.3\u20133.2.9 are applied to 90 per cent of those interest**\n**cash flows. If there is more than one counterparty, each counterparty is not**\n**required to have a proportionate share of the specifically identified cash flows**\n**provided that the transferring entity has a fully proportionate share.**  \n**(b)** **In all other cases, paragraphs 3.2.3\u20133.2.9 are applied to the financial asset in its entirety (or**\n**to the group of similar financial assets in their entirety). For example, when an entity**\n**transfers (i) the rights to the first or the last 90 per cent of cash collections from a financial**\n**asset (or a group of financial assets), or (ii) the rights to 90 per cent of the cash flows from a**\n**group of receivables, but provides a guarantee to compensate the buyer for any credit losses**\n**up to 8 per cent of the principal amount of the receivables, paragraphs 3.2.3\u20133.2.9 are**\n**applied to the financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets) in its entirety.**  \n**In paragraphs 3.2.3\u20133.2.12, the term \u2018financial asset\u2019 refers to either a part of a financial asset (or a**\n**part of a group of similar financial assets) as identified in (a) above or, otherwise, a financial asset (or**\n**a group of similar financial assets) in its entirety.**  \n**3.2.3** **An entity shall derecognise a financial asset when, and only when:**  \n**(a)** **the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or**  \n**(b)** **it transfers the financial asset as set out in paragraphs 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 and the transfer**\n**qualifies for derecognition in accordance with paragraph 3.2.6.**  \n**(See paragraph 3.1.2 for regular way sales of financial assets.)**  \n**3.2.4** **An entity transfers a financial asset if, and only if, it either:**  \n**(a)** **transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, or**  \n**(b)** **retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a**\n**contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement**\n**that meets the conditions in paragraph 3.2.5.**  \n**3.2.5** **When an entity retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the**\n**\u2018original asset\u2019), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more entities**\n**(the \u2018eventual recipients\u2019), the entity treats the transaction as a transfer of a financial asset if, and**\n**only if, all of the following three conditions are met.**  \n**(a)** **The entity has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it collects**\n**equivalent amounts from the original asset. Short-term advances by the entity with the right**\n**of full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates do not violate this**\n**condition.**  \n**(b)** **The entity is prohibited by the terms of the transfer contract from selling or pledging the**\n**original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients for the obligation to pay them**\n**cash flows.**  \n**(c)** **The entity has an obligation to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual**\n**recipients without material delay. In addition, the entity is not entitled to reinvest such cash**\n**flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents (as defined in AASB 107 Statement**\n**_of Cash Flows) during the short settlement period from the collection date to the date of_**  \n-----  **required remittance to the eventual recipients, and interest earned on such investments is**\n**passed to the eventual recipients.**  \n**3.2.6** **When an entity transfers a financial asset (see paragraph 3.2.4), it shall evaluate the extent to which it**\n**retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In this case:**  \n**(a)** **if the entity transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial**\n**asset, the entity shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or**\n**liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.**  \n**(b)** **if the entity retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial**\n**asset, the entity shall continue to recognise the financial asset.**  \n**(c)** **if the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of**\n**ownership of the financial asset, the entity shall determine whether it has retained control of**\n**the financial asset. In this case:**  \n**(i)** **if the entity has not retained control, it shall derecognise the financial asset and**\n**recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or**\n**retained in the transfer.**  \n**(ii)** **if the entity has retained control, it shall continue to recognise the financial asset**\n**to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset (see paragraph**\n**3.2.16).**  \n3.2.7 The transfer of risks and rewards (see paragraph 3.2.6) is evaluated by comparing the entity\u2019s exposure,\nbefore and after the transfer, with the variability in the amounts and timing of the net cash flows of the\ntransferred asset. An entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial\nasset if its exposure to the variability in the present value of the future net cash flows from the financial\nasset does not change significantly as a result of the transfer (eg because the entity has sold a financial asset\nsubject to an agreement to buy it back at a fixed price or the sale price plus a lender\u2019s return). An entity has\ntransferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset if its exposure to such\nvariability is no longer significant in relation to the total variability in the present value of the future net\ncash flows associated with the financial asset (eg because the entity has sold a financial asset subject only to\nan option to buy it back at its _fair value at the time of repurchase or has transferred a fully proportionate_\nshare of the cash flows from a larger financial asset in an arrangement, such as a loan sub-participation, that\nmeets the conditions in paragraph 3.2.5).  \n3.2.8 Often it will be obvious whether the entity has transferred or retained substantially all risks and rewards of\nownership and there will be no need to perform any computations. In other cases, it will be necessary to\ncompute and compare the entity\u2019s exposure to the variability in the present value of the future net cash\nflows before and after the transfer. The computation and comparison are made using as the discount rate an\nappropriate current market interest rate. All reasonably possible variability in net cash flows is considered,\nwith greater weight being given to those outcomes that are more likely to occur.  \n3.2.9 Whether the entity has retained control (see paragraph 3.2.6(c)) of the transferred asset depends on the\ntransferee\u2019s ability to sell the asset. If the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to\nan unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose\nadditional restrictions on the transfer, the entity has not retained control. In all other cases, the entity has\nretained control.",

A write-off**\n**constitutes a derecognition event (see paragraph B3.2.16(r)).**  \n**Changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of**\n**interest rate benchmark reform**  \n5.4.5 An entity shall apply paragraphs 5.4.6\u20125.4.9 to a financial asset or financial liability if, and only if, the basis\nfor determining the contractual cash flows of that financial asset or financial liability changes as a result of\ninterest rate benchmark reform. For this purpose, the term \u2018interest rate benchmark reform\u2019 refers to the\nmarket-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark as described in paragraph 6.8.2.  \n5.4.6 The basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability can change:  \n(a) by amending the contractual terms specified at the initial recognition of the financial instrument\n(for example, the contractual terms are amended to replace the referenced interest rate benchmark\nwith an alternative benchmark rate);  \n(b) in a way that was not considered by \u2013 or contemplated in \u2013 the contractual terms at the initial\nrecognition of the financial instrument, without amending the contractual terms (for example, the\nmethod for calculating the interest rate benchmark is altered without amending the contractual\nterms); and/or  \n(c) because of the activation of an existing contractual term (for example, an existing fallback clause\nis triggered).  \n5.4.7 As a practical expedient, an entity shall apply paragraph B5.4.5 to account for a change in the basis for\ndetermining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that is required by interest\nrate benchmark reform. This practical expedient applies only to such changes and only to the extent the\nchange is required by interest rate benchmark reform (see also paragraph 5.4.9). For this purpose, a change\nin the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if, and\nonly if, both these conditions are met:  \n(a) the change is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform; and  \n(b) the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the\nprevious basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change).  \n5.4.8 Examples of changes that give rise to a new basis for determining the contractual cash flows that is\neconomically equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change) are:  \n(a) the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark used to determine the contractual cash\nflows of a financial asset or financial liability with an alternative benchmark rate \u2013 or the  \n-----  implementation of such a reform of an interest rate benchmark by altering the method used to\ncalculate the interest rate benchmark \u2013 with the addition of a fixed spread necessary to\ncompensate for the basis difference between the existing interest rate benchmark and the\nalternative benchmark rate;  \n(b) changes to the reset period, reset dates or the number of days between coupon payment dates in\norder to implement the reform of an interest rate benchmark; and  \n(c) the addition of a fallback provision to the contractual terms of a financial asset or financial\nliability to enable any change described in (a) and (b) above to be implemented.  \n5.4.9 If changes are made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for\ndetermining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, an entity shall first apply\nthe practical expedient in paragraph 5.4.7 to the changes required by interest rate benchmark reform. The\nentity shall then apply the applicable requirements in this Standard to any additional changes to which the\npractical expedient does not apply. If the additional change does not result in the derecognition of the\nfinancial asset or financial liability, the entity shall apply paragraph 5.4.3 or paragraph B5.4.6, as\napplicable, to account for that additional change. If the additional change results in the derecognition of the\nfinancial asset or financial liability, the entity shall apply the derecognition requirements.",

However, the loss allowance shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and\nshall not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial position.  \n**5.5.3** **Subject to paragraphs 5.5.13\u20135.5.16, at each reporting date, an entity shall measure the loss allowance**\n**for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on**\n**that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.**  \n5.5.4 The objective of the impairment requirements is to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for all financial\ninstruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition \u2013 whether\nassessed on an individual or collective basis \u2013 considering all reasonable and supportable information,\nincluding that which is forward-looking.  \n**5.5.5** **Subject to paragraphs 5.5.13\u20135.5.16, if, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument**\n**has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall measure the loss allowance for**\n**that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.**  \n5.5.6 For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the date that the entity becomes a party to the\nirrevocable commitment shall be considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purposes of applying\nthe impairment requirements.  \n5.5.7 If an entity has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime\nexpected credit losses in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that\nparagraph 5.5.3 is no longer met, the entity shall measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12month expected credit losses at the current reporting date.  \n5.5.8 An entity shall recognise in profit or loss, as an _impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit_\nlosses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is\nrequired to be recognised in accordance with this Standard.  \n**_Determining significant increases in credit risk_**  \n5.5.9 At each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition. When making the assessment, an entity shall use the change in the\nrisk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument instead of the change in the\namount of expected credit losses. To make that assessment, an entity shall compare the risk of a default\noccurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the  \n-----  financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition and consider reasonable and supportable\ninformation, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of significant increases in credit\nrisk since initial recognition.  \n5.5.10 An entity may assume that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since\ninitial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date (see\nparagraphs B5.5.22\u2012B5.5.24).  \n5.5.11 If reasonable and supportable forward-looking information is available without undue cost or effort, an\nentity cannot rely solely on _past due information when determining whether credit risk has increased_\nsignificantly since initial recognition. However, when information that is more forward-looking than past\ndue status (either on an individual or a collective basis) is not available without undue cost or effort, an\nentity may use past due information to determine whether there have been significant increases in credit risk\nsince initial recognition. Regardless of the way in which an entity assesses significant increases in credit\nrisk, there is a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly\nsince initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. An entity can rebut this\npresumption if the entity has reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or\neffort, that demonstrates that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition even\nthough the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. When an entity determines that there have\nbeen significant increases in credit risk before contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, the\nrebuttable presumption does not apply.  \n**_Modified financial assets_**  \n5.5.12 If the contractual cash flows on a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified and the financial asset\nwas not derecognised, an entity shall assess whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk\nof the financial instrument in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 by comparing:  \n(a) the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms); and  \n(b) the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual\nterms).  \n**_Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets_**  \n**5.5.13** **Despite paragraphs 5.5.3 and 5.5.5, at the reporting date, an entity shall only recognise the**\n**cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss allowance for**\n**purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets.**  \n5.5.14 At each reporting date, an entity shall recognise in profit or loss the amount of the change in lifetime\nexpected credit losses as an impairment gain or loss. An entity shall recognise favourable changes in\nlifetime expected credit losses as an impairment gain, even if the lifetime expected credit losses are less\nthan the amount of expected credit losses that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial\nrecognition.  \n**Simplified approach for trade receivables, contract assets and lease**\n**receivables**  \n**5.5.15** **Despite paragraphs 5.5.3 and 5.5.5, an entity shall always measure the loss allowance at an amount**\n**equal to lifetime expected credit losses for:**  \n**(a)** **trade receivables or contract assets that result from transactions that are within the scope of**",

Similarly, two or more instruments\n(or proportions of them) may be jointly designated as the hedging instrument only if, in combination, they\nare not, in effect, a net written option at the date of designation (unless it qualifies in accordance with\nparagraph B6.2.4).",

In that case, and only in that\ncase, the recognised hedge ineffectiveness is presented in other comprehensive income.  \n6.5.4 A hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment may be accounted for as a fair value hedge or a\ncash flow hedge.  \n**6.5.5** **If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge**\n**ratio (see paragraph 6.4.1(c)(iii)) but the risk management objective for that designated hedging**\n**relationship remains the same, an entity shall adjust the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship so**\n**that it meets the qualifying criteria again (this is referred to in this Standard as \u2018rebalancing\u2019 \u2013 see**\n**paragraphs B6.5.7\u2013B6.5.21).**  \n**6.5.6** **An entity shall discontinue hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a**\n**part of a hedging relationship) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after taking into account any**\n**rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable).

The\nresulting classification shall be applied retrospectively irrespective of the entity\u2019s business model in prior\nreporting periods.  \n7.2.4 If, at the date of initial application, it is impracticable (as defined in AASB 108) for an entity to assess a\nmodified time value of money element in accordance with paragraphs B4.1.9B\u2013B4.1.9D on the basis of the\nfacts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset, an entity shall assess the\ncontractual cash flow characteristics of that financial asset on the basis of the facts and circumstances that\nexisted at the initial recognition of the financial asset without taking into account the requirements related to\nthe modification of the time value of money element in paragraphs B4.1.9B\u2013B4.1.9D. (See also paragraph\n42R of AASB 7.)  \n7.2.5 If, at the date of initial application, it is impracticable (as defined in AASB 108) for an entity to assess\nwhether the fair value of a prepayment feature was insignificant in accordance with paragraph B4.1.12(c)\non the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset, an\nentity shall assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of that financial asset on the basis of the facts\nand circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset without taking into account the\nexception for prepayment features in paragraph B4.1.12. (See also paragraph 42S of AASB 7.)  \n7.2.6 If an entity measures a hybrid contract at fair value in accordance with paragraphs 4.1.2A, 4.1.4 or 4.1.5 but\nthe fair value of the hybrid contract had not been measured in comparative reporting periods, the fair value\nof the hybrid contract in the comparative reporting periods shall be the sum of the fair values of the\ncomponents (ie the non-derivative host and the embedded derivative) at the end of each comparative\nreporting period if the entity restates prior periods (see paragraph 7.2.15).  \n7.2.7 If an entity has applied paragraph 7.2.6 then at the date of initial application the entity shall recognise any\ndifference between the fair value of the entire hybrid contract at the date of initial application and the sum\nof the fair values of the components of the hybrid contract at the date of initial application in the opening\nretained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the reporting period that includes the\ndate of initial application.  \n7.2.8 At the date of initial application an entity may designate:  \n(a) a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph\n4.1.5; or  \n(b) an investment in an equity instrument as at fair value through other comprehensive income in\naccordance with paragraph 5.7.5.  \nSuch a designation shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of initial\napplication. That classification shall be applied retrospectively.  \n7.2.9 At the date of initial application an entity:  \n(a) shall revoke its previous designation of a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit\nor loss if that financial asset does not meet the condition in paragraph 4.1.5.  \n(b) may revoke its previous designation of a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or\nloss if that financial asset meets the condition in paragraph 4.1.5.  \nSuch a revocation shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of initial\napplication. That classification shall be applied retrospectively.  \n3 The International Accounting Standards Board issued International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 9 _Financial Instruments on 24_  \nJuly 2014.  \n-----  7.2.10 At the date of initial application, an entity:  \n(a) may designate a financial liability as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance\nwith paragraph 4.2.2(a).  \n(b) shall revoke its previous designation of a financial liability as measured at fair value through\nprofit or loss if such designation was made at initial recognition in accordance with the condition\nnow in paragraph 4.2.2(a) and such designation does not satisfy that condition at the date of initial\napplication.  \n(c) may revoke its previous designation of a financial liability as measured at fair value through\nprofit or loss if such designation was made at initial recognition in accordance with the condition\nnow in paragraph 4.2.2(a) and such designation satisfies that condition at the date of initial\napplication.  \nSuch a designation and revocation shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the\ndate of initial application. That classification shall be applied retrospectively.  \n7.2.11 If it is impracticable (as defined in AASB 108) for an entity to apply retrospectively the effective interest\nmethod, the entity shall treat:  \n(a) the fair value of the financial asset or the financial liability at the end of each comparative period\npresented as the gross carrying amount of that financial asset or the amortised cost of that\nfinancial liability if the entity restates prior periods; and  \n(b) the fair value of the financial asset or the financial liability at the date of initial application as the\nnew gross carrying amount of that financial asset or the new amortised cost of that financial\nliability at the date of initial application of this Standard.  \n7.2.12 If an entity previously accounted at cost (in accordance with AASB 139), for an investment in an equity\ninstrument that does not have a quoted price in an active market for an identical instrument (ie a Level 1\ninput) (or for a derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an equity\ninstrument) it shall measure that instrument at fair value at the date of initial application. Any difference\nbetween the previous carrying amount and the fair value shall be recognised in the opening retained\nearnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the reporting period that includes the date of\ninitial application.  \n7.2.13 If an entity previously accounted for a derivative liability that is linked to, and must be settled by, delivery\nof an equity instrument that does not have a quoted price in an active market for an identical instrument (ie\na Level 1 input) at cost in accordance with AASB 139, it shall measure that derivative liability at fair value\nat the date of initial application. Any difference between the previous carrying amount and the fair value\nshall be recognised in the opening retained earnings of the reporting period that includes the date of initial\napplication.  \n7.2.14 At the date of initial application, an entity shall determine whether the treatment in paragraph 5.7.7 would\ncreate or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss on the basis of the facts and circumstances that\nexist at the date of initial application. This Standard shall be applied retrospectively on the basis of that\ndetermination.  \n7.2.14A At the date of initial application, an entity is permitted to make the designation in paragraph 2.5 for  \ncontracts that already exist on the date but only if it designates all similar contracts. The change in the net\nassets resulting from such designations shall be recognised in retained earnings at the date of initial\napplication.  \n7.2.15 Despite the requirement in paragraph 7.2.1, an entity that adopts the classification and measurement\nrequirements of this Standard (which include the requirements related to amortised cost measurement for\nfinancial assets and impairment in Sections 5.4 and 5.5) shall provide the disclosures set out in paragraphs\n42L\u201342O of AASB 7 but need not restate prior periods. The entity may restate prior periods if, and only if,\nit is possible without the use of hindsight. If an entity does not restate prior periods, the entity shall\nrecognise any difference between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of\nthe annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application in the opening retained earnings (or\nother component of equity, as appropriate) of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial\napplication. However, if an entity restates prior periods, the restated financial statements must reflect all of\nthe requirements in this Standard. If an entity\u2019s chosen approach to applying AASB 9 results in more than\none date of initial application for different requirements, this paragraph applies at each date of initial\napplication (see paragraph 7.2.2). This would be the case, for example, if an entity elects to early apply only\nthe requirements for the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as at fair value\nthrough profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 7.1.2 before applying the other requirements in this\nStandard.  \n-----  7.2.16 If an entity prepares interim financial reports in accordance with AASB 134 _Interim Financial Reporting_\nthe entity need not apply the requirements in this Standard to interim periods prior to the date of initial\napplication if it is impracticable (as defined in AASB 108).  \n**_Impairment (Section 5.5)_**  \n7.2.17 An entity shall apply the impairment requirements in Section 5.5 retrospectively in accordance with\nAASB 108 subject to paragraphs 7.2.15 and 7.2.18\u20137.2.20.  \n7.2.18 At the date of initial application, an entity shall use reasonable and supportable information that is available\nwithout undue cost or effort to determine the credit risk at the date that a financial instrument was initially\nrecognised (or for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts at the date that the entity became a\nparty to the irrevocable commitment in accordance with paragraph 5.5.6) and compare that to the credit risk\nat the date of initial application of this Standard.  \n7.2.19 When determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, an\nentity may apply:  \n(a) the requirements in paragraphs 5.5.10 and B5.5.22\u2013B5.5.24; and  \n(b) the rebuttable presumption in paragraph 5.5.11 for contractual payments that are more than 30\ndays past due if an entity will apply the impairment requirements by identifying significant\nincreases in credit risk since initial recognition for those financial instruments on the basis of past\ndue information.  \n7.2.20 If, at the date of initial application, determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk\nsince initial recognition would require undue cost or effort, an entity shall recognise a loss allowance at an\namount equal to lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date until that financial instrument is\nderecognised (unless that financial instrument is low credit risk at a reporting date, in which case paragraph\n7.2.19(a) applies).",

An\nentity shall apply that policy to all of its hedging relationships. An entity that chooses that policy shall also\napply Interpretation 16 _Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation without the amendments that_\nconform that Interpretation to the requirements in Chapter 6 of this Standard.  \nAus7.2.21.1 AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and AASB 2014-7 Amendments\n_to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 (December 2014) amend paragraphs 3,_\n5\u20137, 14, 16, AG1, AG8 and IE5 of Interpretation 16 and add paragraphs 18A\u201318B to conform\nInterpretation 16 to the requirements in Chapter 6 of this Standard.  \n7.2.22 Except as provided in paragraph 7.2.26, an entity shall apply the hedge accounting requirements of this\nStandard prospectively.  \n7.2.23 To apply hedge accounting from the date of initial application of the hedge accounting requirements of this\nStandard, all qualifying criteria must be met as at that date.  \n7.2.24 Hedging relationships that qualified for hedge accounting in accordance with AASB 139 that also qualify\nfor hedge accounting in accordance with the criteria of this Standard (see paragraph 6.4.1), after taking into\naccount any rebalancing of the hedging relationship on transition (see paragraph 7.2.25(b)), shall be\nregarded as continuing hedging relationships.  \n7.2.25 On initial application of the hedge accounting requirements of this Standard, an entity:  \n(a) may start to apply those requirements from the same point in time as it ceases to apply the hedge\naccounting requirements of AASB 139; and  \n(b) shall consider the hedge ratio in accordance with AASB 139 as the starting point for rebalancing\nthe hedge ratio of a continuing hedging relationship, if applicable. Any gain or loss from such a\nrebalancing shall be recognised in profit or loss.  \n7.2.26 As an exception to prospective application of the hedge accounting requirements of this Standard, an entity:  \n(a) shall apply the accounting for the time value of options in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15\nretrospectively if, in accordance with AASB 139, only the change in an option\u2019s intrinsic value\nwas designated as a hedging instrument in a hedging relationship. This retrospective application\napplies only to those hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the earliest\ncomparative period or were designated thereafter.  \n-----  (b) may apply the accounting for the forward element of forward contracts in accordance with\nparagraph 6.5.16 retrospectively if, in accordance with AASB 139, only the change in the spot\nelement of a forward contract was designated as a hedging instrument in a hedging relationship.\nThis retrospective application applies only to those hedging relationships that existed at the\nbeginning of the earliest comparative period or were designated thereafter. In addition, if an entity\nelects retrospective application of this accounting, it shall be applied to all hedging relationships\nthat qualify for this election (ie on transition this election is not available on a hedgingrelationship-by-hedging-relationship basis). The accounting for foreign currency basis spreads\n(see paragraph 6.5.16) may be applied retrospectively for those hedging relationships that existed\nat the beginning of the earliest comparative period or were designated thereafter.  \n(c) shall apply retrospectively the requirement of paragraph 6.5.6 that there is not an expiration or\ntermination of the hedging instrument if:  \n(i) as a consequence of laws or regulations, or the introduction of laws or regulations, the\nparties to the hedging instrument agree that one or more clearing counterparties replace\ntheir original counterparty to become the new counterparty to each of the parties; and  \n(ii) other changes, if any, to the hedging instrument are limited to those that are necessary\nto effect such a replacement of the counterparty.  \n(d) shall apply the requirements in Section 6.8 retrospectively. This retrospective application applies\nonly to those hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which\nan entity first applies those requirements or were designated thereafter, and to the amount\naccumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in\nwhich an entity first applies those requirements.  \n**Entities that have applied AASB 9 (December 2009) or AASB 9 (December**\n**2010) early**  \n7.2.27 An entity shall apply the transition requirements in paragraphs 7.2.1\u20137.2.26 at the relevant date of initial\napplication. An entity shall apply each of the transition provisions in paragraphs 7.2.3\u20137.2.14A and 7.2.17\u2013\n7.2.26 only once (ie if an entity chooses an approach of applying AASB 9 that involves more than one date\nof initial application, it cannot apply any of those provisions again if they were already applied at an earlier\ndate). (See paragraphs 7.2.2 and Aus1.4).  \nAus7.2.27.1 An entity\u2019s chosen approach to applying AASB 9 may include applying AASB 9 (December\n2009) or AASB 9 (December 2010) in advance of the Standard\u2019s mandatory application date. In\nthese instances, an entity will have more than one date of initial application, and will have\npreviously applied some or all of the transition provisions specified by AASB 9 (December 2009)\nor AASB 9 (December 2010).

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired include observable\ndata about the following events:  \n(a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;  \n(b) a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;  \n(c) the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons\nrelating to the borrower\u2019s financial difficulty, having granted to the\nborrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise\nconsider;  \n(d) it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other\nfinancial reorganisation;  \n(e) the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of\nfinancial difficulties; or  \n(f) the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that\nreflects the incurred credit losses.  \nIt may not be possible to identify a single discrete event \u2013 instead, the combined\neffect of several events may have caused financial assets to become creditimpaired.  \n**credit loss** The difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in\naccordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to\nreceive (ie all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original **effective interest rate**\n(or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit**impaired financial assets). An entity shall estimate cash flows by considering all**\ncontractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension,\ncall and similar options) through the expected life of that financial instrument.\nThe cash flows that are considered shall include cash flows from the sale of\ncollateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual\nterms. There is a presumption that the expected life of a financial instrument can\nbe estimated reliably. However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to\nreliably estimate the expected life of a financial instrument, the entity shall use the\nremaining contractual term of the financial instrument.  \n**credit-adjusted effective**\n**interest rate**  \nThe rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts\nthrough the expected life of the financial asset to the **amortised cost of a**\n**financial asset that is a** **purchased or originated credit-impaired financial**\n**asset. When calculating the credit-adjusted effective interest rate, an entity shall**\nestimate the expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the  \n-----  financial asset (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) and\n**expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or**\nreceived between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective\ninterest rate (see paragraphs B5.4.1\u2012B5.4.3), **transaction costs, and all other**\npremiums or discounts. There is a presumption that the cash flows and the\nexpected life of a group of similar financial instruments can be estimated reliably.\nHowever, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash\nflows or the remaining life of a financial instrument (or group of financial\ninstruments), the entity shall use the contractual cash flows over the full\ncontractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).  \n**derecognition** The removal of a previously recognised financial asset or financial liability from\nan entity\u2019s statement of financial position.  \n**derivative** A financial instrument or other contract within the scope of this Standard with all\nthree of the following characteristics.  \n(a) its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate,\nfinancial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate,\nindex of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable,\nprovided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not\nspecific to a party to the contract (sometimes called the \u2018underlying\u2019).  \n(b) it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is\nsmaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would\nbe expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.  \n(c) it is settled at a future date.  \n**dividends** Distributions of profits to holders of equity instruments in proportion to their\nholdings of a particular class of capital.  \n**effective interest method** The method that is used in the calculation of the **amortised cost of a financial**\n**asset or a financial liability and in the allocation and recognition of the interest**\nrevenue or interest expense in profit or loss over the relevant period.  \n**effective interest rate** The rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through\nthe expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the **gross carrying**\n**amount of a financial asset or to the** **amortised cost of a financial liability.**\nWhen calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate the expected\ncash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for\nexample, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but shall not consider\nthe **expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or**\nreceived between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective\ninterest rate (see paragraphs B5.4.1\u2013B5.4.3), **transaction costs, and all other**\npremiums or discounts. There is a presumption that the cash flows and the\nexpected life of a group of similar financial instruments can be estimated reliably.\nHowever, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash\nflows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial\ninstruments), the entity shall use the contractual cash flows over the full\ncontractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).  \n**expected credit losses** The weighted average of **credit losses with the respective risks of a default**\noccurring as the weights.  \n**financial guarantee contract** A contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the\nholder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when\ndue in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.  \n-----  **financial liability at fair**\n**value through profit or loss**  \nA financial liability that meets one of the following conditions.  \n(a) it meets the definition of held for trading.  \n(b) upon initial recognition it is designated by the entity as at fair value\nthrough profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 4.2.2 or 4.3.5.  \n(c) it is designated either upon initial recognition or subsequently as at fair\nvalue through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 6.7.1.  \n**firm commitment** A binding agreement for the exchange of a specified quantity of resources at a\nspecified price on a specified future date or dates.  \n**forecast transaction** An uncommitted but anticipated future transaction.  \n**gross carrying amount of a**\n**financial asset**  \nThe amortised cost of a financial asset, before adjusting for any loss allowance.  \n**hedge ratio** The relationship between the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity\nof the hedged item in terms of their relative weighting.  \n**held for trading** A financial asset or financial liability that:  \n(a) is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or\nrepurchasing it in the near term;  \n(b) on initial recognition is part of a portfolio of identified financial\ninstruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence\nof a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or  \n(c) is a **derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee**\ncontract or a designated and effective hedging instrument).  \n**impairment gain or loss** Gains or losses that are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with paragraph\n5.5.8 and that arise from applying the impairment requirements in Section 5.5.  \n**lifetime expected credit**\n**losses**  \nThe **expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the**\nexpected life of a financial instrument.  \n**loss allowance** The allowance for **expected credit losses on financial assets measured in**\naccordance with paragraph 4.1.2, lease receivables and **contract assets, the**\naccumulated impairment amount for financial assets measured in accordance with\nparagraph 4.1.2A and the provision for expected credit losses on loan\ncommitments and financial guarantee contracts.  \n**modification gain or loss** The amount arising from adjusting the **gross carrying amount of a financial**\n**asset to reflect the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows. The entity**\nrecalculates the gross carrying amount of a financial asset as the present value of\nthe estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the\nrenegotiated or modified financial asset that are discounted at the financial asset\u2019s\noriginal effective interest rate (or the original credit-adjusted effective interest\n**rate for** **purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when**\napplicable, the revised **effective interest rate calculated in accordance with**\nparagraph 6.5.10. When estimating the expected cash flows of a financial asset, an\nentity shall consider all contractual terms of the financial asset (for example,\nprepayment, call and similar options) but shall not consider the **expected credit**\n**losses, unless the financial asset is a** **purchased or originated credit-impaired**\n**financial asset, in which case an entity shall also consider the initial expected**\ncredit losses that were considered when calculating the original **credit-adjusted**\n**effective interest rate.**  \n**past due** A financial asset is past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment\nwhen that payment was contractually due.  \n**purchased or originated**\n**credit-impaired financial**\n**asset**  \nPurchased or originated financial asset(s) that are **credit-impaired on initial**\nrecognition.  \n-----  **reclassification date** The first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model\nthat results in an entity reclassifying financial assets.  \n**regular way purchase or**\n**sale**  \nA purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require\ndelivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or\nconvention in the marketplace concerned.  \n**transaction costs** Incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal\nof a financial asset or financial liability (see paragraph B5.4.8). An incremental\ncost is one that would not have been incurred if the entity had not acquired, issued\nor disposed of the financial instrument.  \nThe following terms are defined in paragraph 11 of AASB 132, Appendix A of AASB 7, Appendix A of AASB 13 or\nAppendix A of AASB 15 and are used in this Standard with the meanings specified in AASB 132, AASB 7, AASB 13\nor AASB 15:  \n(a) credit risk;[4]  \n(b) equity instrument;  \n(c) fair value;  \n(d) financial asset;  \n(e) financial instrument;  \n(f) financial liability;  \n(g) transaction price.  \n4 This term (as defined in AASB 7) is used in the requirements for presenting the effects of changes in credit risk on liabilities designated\nas at fair value through profit or loss (see paragraph 5.7.7).  \n-----  ",

(Those based\non climatic variables are sometimes referred to as \u2018weather derivatives\u2019.) If those contracts are not within\nthe scope of AASB 17 Insurance Contracts, they are within the scope of this Standard.  \nAusB2.1.1 Notwithstanding paragraph B2.1, for public sector entities applying AASB 4 Insurance\n_Contracts, contracts that require a payment based on climatic, geological or other physical_\nvariables and are not within the scope of AASB 4 or AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts\nare within the scope of this Standard.  \nB2.2 This Standard does not change the requirements relating to employee benefit plans that comply with AASB\n1056 Superannuation Entities and royalty agreements based on the volume of sales or service revenues that\nare accounted for under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  \nB2.3 Sometimes, an entity makes what it views as a \u2018strategic investment\u2019 in equity instruments issued by\nanother entity, with the intention of establishing or maintaining a long-term operating relationship with the\nentity in which the investment is made. The investor or joint venturer entity uses AASB 128 Investments in\n_Associates and Joint Ventures to determine whether the equity method of accounting shall be applied to_\nsuch an investment.  \nB2.4 This Standard applies to the financial assets and financial liabilities of insurers, other than rights and\nobligations that paragraph 2.1(e) excludes because they arise under contracts within the scope of AASB 17.  \nAusB2.4.1 Notwithstanding paragraph B2.4, for public sector entities applying AASB 4, this Standard\napplies to the financial assets and financial liabilities of a public sector insurer, other than rights\nand obligations that paragraph Aus2.1.2 excludes because they arise under contracts within the\nscope of AASB 4.  \nB2.5 Financial guarantee contracts may have various legal forms, such as a guarantee, some types of letter of\ncredit, a credit default contract or an insurance contract. Their accounting treatment does not depend on\ntheir legal form. The following are examples of the appropriate treatment (see paragraph 2.1(e)):  \n(a) Although a financial guarantee contract meets the definition of an insurance contract in AASB 17\n(see paragraph 7(e) of AASB 17) if the risk transferred is significant, the issuer applies this\nStandard. Nevertheless, if the issuer has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such\ncontracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting that is applicable to insurance contracts,\nthe issuer may elect to apply either this Standard or AASB 17 to such financial guarantee\ncontracts. If this Standard applies, paragraph 5.1.1 requires the issuer to recognise a financial\nguarantee contract initially at fair value. If the financial guarantee contract was issued to an\nunrelated party in a stand-alone arm\u2019s length transaction, its fair value at inception is likely to\nequal the premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary. Subsequently, unless the\nfinancial guarantee contract was designated at inception as at fair value through profit or loss or\nunless paragraphs 3.2.15\u20133.2.23 and B3.2.12\u2013B3.2.17 apply (when a transfer of a financial asset\ndoes not qualify for derecognition or the continuing involvement approach applies), the issuer\nmeasures it at the higher of:  \n(i) the amount determined in accordance with Section 5.5; and  \n(ii) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of\nincome recognised in accordance with the principles of AASB 15 (see paragraph\n4.2.1(c)).  \n(b) Some credit-related guarantees do not, as a precondition for payment, require that the holder is\nexposed to, and has incurred a loss on, the failure of the debtor to make payments on the\nguaranteed asset when due. An example of such a guarantee is one that requires payments in\nresponse to changes in a specified credit rating or credit index. Such guarantees are not financial\nguarantee contracts as defined in this Standard, and are not insurance contracts as defined in\nAASB 17. Such guarantees are derivatives and the issuer applies this Standard to them.  \n-----  (c) If a financial guarantee contract was issued in connection with the sale of goods, the issuer\napplies AASB 15 in determining when it recognises the revenue from the guarantee and from the\nsale of goods.  \nB2.6 Assertions that an issuer regards contracts as insurance contracts are typically found throughout the issuer\u2019s\ncommunications with customers and regulators, contracts, business documentation and financial statements.\nFurthermore, insurance contracts are often subject to accounting requirements that are distinct from the\nrequirements for other types of transaction, such as contracts issued by banks or commercial companies. In\nsuch cases, an issuer\u2019s financial statements typically include a statement that the issuer has used those\naccounting requirements.",

If a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition, the transferee does\nnot recognise the transferred asset as its asset (see paragraph B3.2.15).  \nB3.1.2 The following are examples of applying the principle in paragraph 3.1.1:  \n(a) Unconditional receivables and payables are recognised as assets or liabilities when the entity\nbecomes a party to the contract and, as a consequence, has a legal right to receive or a legal\nobligation to pay cash.  \n(b) Assets to be acquired and liabilities to be incurred as a result of a firm commitment to purchase or\nsell goods or services are generally not recognised until at least one of the parties has performed\nunder the agreement. For example, an entity that receives a firm order does not generally\nrecognise an asset (and the entity that places the order does not recognise a liability) at the time of\nthe commitment but, instead, delays recognition until the ordered goods or services have been\nshipped, delivered or rendered. If a firm commitment to buy or sell non-financial items is within\nthe scope of this Standard in accordance with paragraphs 2.4\u20132.7, its net fair value is recognised\nas an asset or a liability on the commitment date (see paragraph B4.1.30(c)). In addition, if a\npreviously unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge,\nany change in the net fair value attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or a\nliability after the inception of the hedge (see paragraphs 6.5.8(b) and 6.5.9).  \n(c) A forward contract that is within the scope of this Standard (see paragraph 2.1) is recognised as\nan asset or a liability on the commitment date, instead of on the date on which settlement takes\nplace. When an entity becomes a party to a forward contract, the fair values of the right and\nobligation are often equal, so that the net fair value of the forward is zero. If the net fair value of\nthe right and obligation is not zero, the contract is recognised as an asset or liability.  \n(d) Option contracts that are within the scope of this Standard (see paragraph 2.1) are recognised as\nassets or liabilities when the holder or writer becomes a party to the contract.  \n(e) Planned future transactions, no matter how likely, are not assets and liabilities because the entity\nhas not become a party to a contract.",

An entity shall apply the same\nmethod consistently for all purchases and sales of financial assets that are classified in the same way in\naccordance with this Standard. For this purpose assets that are mandatorily measured at fair value through\nprofit or loss form a separate classification from assets designated as measured at fair value through profit\nor loss. In addition, investments in equity instruments accounted for using the option provided in paragraph\n5.7.5 form a separate classification.  \nB3.1.4 A contract that requires or permits net settlement of the change in the value of the contract is not a regular\nway contract. Instead, such a contract is accounted for as a derivative in the period between the trade date\nand the settlement date.  \nB3.1.5 The trade date is the date that an entity commits itself to purchase or sell an asset. Trade date accounting\nrefers to (a) the recognition of an asset to be received and the liability to pay for it on the trade date, and (b)\nderecognition of an asset that is sold, recognition of any gain or loss on disposal and the recognition of a  \n-----  receivable from the buyer for payment on the trade date. Generally, interest does not start to accrue on the\nasset and corresponding liability until the settlement date when title passes.  \nB3.1.6 The settlement date is the date that an asset is delivered to or by an entity. Settlement date accounting refers\nto (a) the recognition of an asset on the day it is received by the entity, and (b) the derecognition of an asset\nand recognition of any gain or loss on disposal on the day that it is delivered by the entity. When settlement\ndate accounting is applied an entity accounts for any change in the fair value of the asset to be received\nduring the period between the trade date and the settlement date in the same way as it accounts for the\nacquired asset.

In that case, the\nfinancial assets qualify for derecognition if the conditions in paragraphs 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 are met.  \nB3.2.3 In applying paragraph 3.2.5, the entity could be, for example, the originator of the financial asset, or it could\nbe a group that includes a subsidiary that has acquired the financial asset and passes on cash flows to\nunrelated third party investors.  \n**_Evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership (paragraph 3.2.6)_**  \nB3.2.4 Examples of when an entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are:  \n(a) an unconditional sale of a financial asset;  \n(b) a sale of a financial asset together with an option to repurchase the financial asset at its fair value\nat the time of repurchase; and  \n(c) a sale of a financial asset together with a put or call option that is deeply out of the money (ie an\noption that is so far out of the money it is highly unlikely to go into the money before expiry).  \nB3.2.5 Examples of when an entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are:  \n(a) a sale and repurchase transaction where the repurchase price is a fixed price or the sale price plus\na lender\u2019s return;  \n(b) a securities lending agreement;  \n(c) a sale of a financial asset together with a total return swap that transfers the market risk exposure\nback to the entity;  \n(d) a sale of a financial asset together with a deep in-the-money put or call option (ie an option that is\nso far in the money that it is highly unlikely to go out of the money before expiry); and  \n(e) a sale of short-term receivables in which the entity guarantees to compensate the transferee for\ncredit losses that are likely to occur.  \nB3.2.6 If an entity determines that as a result of the transfer, it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards\nof ownership of the transferred asset, it does not recognise the transferred asset again in a future period,\nunless it reacquires the transferred asset in a new transaction.  \n**_Evaluation of the transfer of control_**  \nB3.2.7 An entity has not retained control of a transferred asset if the transferee has the practical ability to sell the\ntransferred asset. An entity has retained control of a transferred asset if the transferee does not have the\npractical ability to sell the transferred asset. A transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred asset\nif it is traded in an active market because the transferee could repurchase the transferred asset in the market\nif it needs to return the asset to the entity. For example, a transferee may have the practical ability to sell a\ntransferred asset if the transferred asset is subject to an option that allows the entity to repurchase it, but the\ntransferee can readily obtain the transferred asset in the market if the option is exercised. A transferee does\nnot have the practical ability to sell the transferred asset if the entity retains such an option and the\ntransferee cannot readily obtain the transferred asset in the market if the entity exercises its option.  \nB3.2.8 The transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred asset only if the transferee can sell the\ntransferred asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and\nwithout imposing additional restrictions on the transfer. The critical question is what the transferee is able to\ndo in practice, not what contractual rights the transferee has concerning what it can do with the transferred\nasset or what contractual prohibitions exist. In particular:  \n(a) a contractual right to dispose of the transferred asset has little practical effect if there is no market\nfor the transferred asset, and  \n(b) an ability to dispose of the transferred asset has little practical effect if it cannot be exercised\nfreely. For that reason:  \n(i) the transferee\u2019s ability to dispose of the transferred asset must be independent of the\nactions of others (ie it must be a unilateral ability), and  \n-----  (ii) the transferee must be able to dispose of the transferred asset without needing to attach\nrestrictive conditions or \u2018strings\u2019 to the transfer (eg conditions about how a loan asset is\nserviced or an option giving the transferee the right to repurchase the asset).  \nB3.2.9 That the transferee is unlikely to sell the transferred asset does not, of itself, mean that the transferor has\nretained control of the transferred asset. However, if a put option or guarantee constrains the transferee from\nselling the transferred asset, then the transferor has retained control of the transferred asset. For example, if\na put option or guarantee is sufficiently valuable it constrains the transferee from selling the transferred\nasset because the transferee would, in practice, not sell the transferred asset to a third party without\nattaching a similar option or other restrictive conditions. Instead, the transferee would hold the transferred\nasset so as to obtain payments under the guarantee or put option. Under these circumstances the transferor\nhas retained control of the transferred asset.",

        "page_content=": "### Continuing involvement in transferred assets\nB3.2.13 The following are examples of how an entity measures a transferred asset and the associated liability under  \nparagraph 3.2.16.  \n**_All assets_**  \n(a) If a guarantee provided by an entity to pay for default losses on a transferred asset prevents the\ntransferred asset from being derecognised to the extent of the continuing involvement, the\ntransferred asset at the date of the transfer is measured at the lower of (i) the carrying amount of\nthe asset and (ii) the maximum amount of the consideration received in the transfer that the entity\ncould be required to repay (\u2018the guarantee amount\u2019). The associated liability is initially measured\nat the guarantee amount plus the fair value of the guarantee (which is normally the consideration\nreceived for the guarantee). Subsequently, the initial fair value of the guarantee is recognised in\nprofit or loss when (or as) the obligation is satisfied (in accordance with the principles of AASB\n15) and the carrying value of the asset is reduced by any loss allowance.  \n**_Assets measured at amortised cost_**  \n(b) If a put option obligation written by an entity or call option right held by an entity prevents a\ntransferred asset from being derecognised and the entity measures the transferred asset at\namortised cost, the associated liability is measured at its cost (ie the consideration received)\nadjusted for the amortisation of any difference between that cost and the gross carrying amount of\nthe transferred asset at the expiration date of the option. For example, assume that the gross\ncarrying amount of the asset on the date of the transfer is CU98 and that the consideration\nreceived is CU95. The gross carrying amount of the asset on the option exercise date will be\nCU100. The initial carrying amount of the associated liability is CU95 and the difference between  \n-----  CU95 and CU100 is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. If the option\nis exercised, any difference between the carrying amount of the associated liability and the\nexercise price is recognised in profit or loss.  \n**_Assets measured at fair value_**  \n(c) If a call option right retained by an entity prevents a transferred asset from being derecognised\nand the entity measures the transferred asset at fair value, the asset continues to be measured at its\nfair value. The associated liability is measured at (i) the option exercise price less the time value\nof the option if the option is in or at the money, or (ii) the fair value of the transferred asset less\nthe time value of the option if the option is out of the money. The adjustment to the measurement\nof the associated liability ensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the associated\nliability is the fair value of the call option right. For example, if the fair value of the underlying\nasset is CU80, the option exercise price is CU95 and the time value of the option is CU5, the\ncarrying amount of the associated liability is CU75 (CU80 \u2013 CU5) and the carrying amount of\nthe transferred asset is CU80 (ie its fair value).  \n(d) If a put option written by an entity prevents a transferred asset from being derecognised and the\nentity measures the transferred asset at fair value, the associated liability is measured at the option\nexercise price plus the time value of the option. The measurement of the asset at fair value is\nlimited to the lower of the fair value and the option exercise price because the entity has no right\nto increases in the fair value of the transferred asset above the exercise price of the option. This\nensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the associated liability is the fair value of the\nput option obligation. For example, if the fair value of the underlying asset is CU120, the option\nexercise price is CU100 and the time value of the option is CU5, the carrying amount of the\nassociated liability is CU105 (CU100 + CU5) and the carrying amount of the asset is CU100 (in\nthis case the option exercise price).  \n(e) If a collar, in the form of a purchased call and written put, prevents a transferred asset from being\nderecognised and the entity measures the asset at fair value, it continues to measure the asset at\nfair value. The associated liability is measured at (i) the sum of the call exercise price and fair\nvalue of the put option less the time value of the call option, if the call option is in or at the\nmoney, or (ii) the sum of the fair value of the asset and the fair value of the put option less the\ntime value of the call option if the call option is out of the money. The adjustment to the\nassociated liability ensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the associated liability is\nthe fair value of the options held and written by the entity. For example, assume an entity\ntransfers a financial asset that is measured at fair value while simultaneously purchasing a call\nwith an exercise price of CU120 and writing a put with an exercise price of CU80. Assume also\nthat the fair value of the asset is CU100 at the date of the transfer. The time value of the put and\ncall are CU1 and CU5 respectively. In this case, the entity recognises an asset of CU100 (the fair\nvalue of the asset) and a liability of CU96 [(CU100 + CU1) \u2013 CU5]. This gives a net asset value\nof CU4, which is the fair value of the options held and written by the entity.",

        "page_content=": "### Examples\nB3.2.16 The following examples illustrate the application of the derecognition principles of this Standard.  \n(a) _Repurchase agreements and securities lending. If a financial asset is sold under an agreement to_\nrepurchase it at a fixed price or at the sale price plus a lender\u2019s return or if it is loaned under an\nagreement to return it to the transferor, it is not derecognised because the transferor retains\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. If the transferee obtains the right to sell or  \n-----  pledge the asset, the transferor reclassifies the asset in its statement of financial position, for\nexample, as a loaned asset or repurchase receivable.  \n(b) _Repurchase agreements and securities lending \u2013 assets that are substantially the same. If a_\nfinancial asset is sold under an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same asset\nat a fixed price or at the sale price plus a lender\u2019s return or if a financial asset is borrowed or\nloaned under an agreement to return the same or substantially the same asset to the transferor, it is\nnot derecognised because the transferor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of\nownership.  \n(c) _Repurchase agreements and securities lending \u2013 right of substitution. If a repurchase agreement_\nat a fixed repurchase price or a price equal to the sale price plus a lender\u2019s return, or a similar\nsecurities lending transaction, provides the transferee with a right to substitute assets that are\nsimilar and of equal fair value to the transferred asset at the repurchase date, the asset sold or lent\nunder a repurchase or securities lending transaction is not derecognised because the transferor\nretains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.  \n(d) _Repurchase right of first refusal at fair value. If an entity sells a financial asset and retains only a_\nright of first refusal to repurchase the transferred asset at fair value if the transferee subsequently\nsells it, the entity derecognises the asset because it has transferred substantially all the risks and\nrewards of ownership.  \n(e) _Wash sale transaction. The repurchase of a financial asset shortly after it has been sold is_\nsometimes referred to as a wash sale. Such a repurchase does not preclude derecognition provided\nthat the original transaction met the derecognition requirements. However, if an agreement to sell\na financial asset is entered into concurrently with an agreement to repurchase the same asset at a\nfixed price or the sale price plus a lender\u2019s return, then the asset is not derecognised.  \n(f) _Put options and call options that are deeply in the money. If a transferred financial asset can be_\ncalled back by the transferor and the call option is deeply in the money, the transfer does not\nqualify for derecognition because the transferor has retained substantially all the risks and\nrewards of ownership. Similarly, if the financial asset can be put back by the transferee and the\nput option is deeply in the money, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition because the\ntransferor has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.  \n(g) _Put options and call options that are deeply out of the money. A financial asset that is transferred_\nsubject only to a deep out-of-the-money put option held by the transferee or a deep out-of-themoney call option held by the transferor is derecognised. This is because the transferor has\ntransferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.  \n(h) _Readily obtainable assets subject to a call option that is neither deeply in the money nor deeply_\n_out of the money. If an entity holds a call option on an asset that is readily obtainable in the_\nmarket and the option is neither deeply in the money nor deeply out of the money, the asset is\nderecognised. This is because the entity (i) has neither retained nor transferred substantially all\nthe risks and rewards of ownership, and (ii) has not retained control. However, if the asset is not\nreadily obtainable in the market, derecognition is precluded to the extent of the amount of the\nasset that is subject to the call option because the entity has retained control of the asset.  \n(i) _A not readily obtainable asset subject to a put option written by an entity that is neither deeply in_\n_the money nor deeply out of the money. If an entity transfers a financial asset that is not readily_\nobtainable in the market, and writes a put option that is not deeply out of the money, the entity\nneither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership because of the\nwritten put option. The entity retains control of the asset if the put option is sufficiently valuable\nto prevent the transferee from selling the asset, in which case the asset continues to be recognised\nto the extent of the transferor\u2019s continuing involvement (see paragraph B3.2.9). The entity\ntransfers control of the asset if the put option is not sufficiently valuable to prevent the transferee\nfrom selling the asset, in which case the asset is derecognised.  \n(j) _Assets subject to a fair value put or call option or a forward repurchase agreement. A transfer of_\na financial asset that is subject only to a put or call option or a forward repurchase agreement that\nhas an exercise or repurchase price equal to the fair value of the financial asset at the time of\nrepurchase results in derecognition because of the transfer of substantially all the risks and\nrewards of ownership.  \n(k) _Cash-settled call or put options. An entity evaluates the transfer of a financial asset that is subject_\nto a put or call option or a forward repurchase agreement that will be settled net in cash to\ndetermine whether it has retained or transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of\nownership. If the entity has not retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the\ntransferred asset, it determines whether it has retained control of the transferred asset. That the  \n-----  put or the call or the forward repurchase agreement is settled net in cash does not automatically\nmean that the entity has transferred control (see paragraphs B3.2.9 and (g), (h) and (i) above).  \n(l) _Removal of accounts provision. A removal of accounts provision is an unconditional repurchase_\n(call) option that gives an entity the right to reclaim assets transferred subject to some restrictions.\nProvided that such an option results in the entity neither retaining nor transferring substantially all\nthe risks and rewards of ownership, it precludes derecognition only to the extent of the amount\nsubject to repurchase (assuming that the transferee cannot sell the assets). For example, if the\ncarrying amount and proceeds from the transfer of loan assets are CU100,000 and any individual\nloan could be called back but the aggregate amount of loans that could be repurchased could not\nexceed CU10,000, CU90,000 of the loans would qualify for derecognition.  \n(m) _Clean-up calls. An entity, which may be a transferor, that services transferred assets may hold a_\nclean-up call to purchase remaining transferred assets when the amount of outstanding assets falls\nto a specified level at which the cost of servicing those assets becomes burdensome in relation to\nthe benefits of servicing. Provided that such a clean-up call results in the entity neither retaining\nnor transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the transferee cannot sell\nthe assets, it precludes derecognition only to the extent of the amount of the assets that is subject\nto the call option.  \n(n) _Subordinated retained interests and credit guarantees. An entity may provide the transferee with_\ncredit enhancement by subordinating some or all of its interest retained in the transferred asset.\nAlternatively, an entity may provide the transferee with credit enhancement in the form of a credit\nguarantee that could be unlimited or limited to a specified amount. If the entity retains\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the asset continues to\nbe recognised in its entirety. If the entity retains some, but not substantially all, of the risks and\nrewards of ownership and has retained control, derecognition is precluded to the extent of the\namount of cash or other assets that the entity could be required to pay.  \n(o) _Total return swaps. An entity may sell a financial asset to a transferee and enter into a total return_\nswap with the transferee, whereby all of the interest payment cash flows from the underlying\nasset are remitted to the entity in exchange for a fixed payment or variable rate payment and any\nincreases or declines in the fair value of the underlying asset are absorbed by the entity. In such a\ncase, derecognition of all of the asset is prohibited.  \n(p) _Interest rate swaps. An entity may transfer to a transferee a fixed rate financial asset and enter_\ninto an interest rate swap with the transferee to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable\ninterest rate based on a notional amount that is equal to the principal amount of the transferred\nfinancial asset. The interest rate swap does not preclude derecognition of the transferred asset\nprovided the payments on the swap are not conditional on payments being made on the\ntransferred asset.  \n(q) _Amortising interest rate swaps. An entity may transfer to a transferee a fixed rate financial asset_\nthat is paid off over time, and enter into an amortising interest rate swap with the transferee to\nreceive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate based on a notional amount. If the\nnotional amount of the swap amortises so that it equals the principal amount of the transferred\nfinancial asset outstanding at any point in time, the swap would generally result in the entity\nretaining substantial prepayment risk, in which case the entity either continues to recognise all of\nthe transferred asset or continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing\ninvolvement. Conversely, if the amortisation of the notional amount of the swap is not linked to\nthe principal amount outstanding of the transferred asset, such a swap would not result in the\nentity retaining prepayment risk on the asset. Hence, it would not preclude derecognition of the\ntransferred asset provided the payments on the swap are not conditional on interest payments\nbeing made on the transferred asset and the swap does not result in the entity retaining any other\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership on the transferred asset.  \n(r) _Write-off. An entity has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows on a_\nfinancial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.  \nB3.2.17 This paragraph illustrates the application of the continuing involvement approach when the entity\u2019s  \ncontinuing involvement is in a part of a financial asset.  \nAssume an entity has a portfolio of prepayable loans whose coupon and effective interest rate is 10 per cent\nand whose principal amount and amortised cost is CU10,000. It enters into a transaction in which, in return\nfor a payment of CU9,115, the transferee obtains the right to CU9,000 of any collections of principal plus\ninterest thereon at 9.5 per cent. The entity retains rights to CU1,000 of any collections of principal plus\ninterest thereon at 10 per cent, plus the excess spread of 0.5 per cent on the remaining CU9,000 of principal.  \n-----  Collections from prepayments are allocated between the entity and the transferee proportionately in the\nratio  \nof 1:9, but any defaults are deducted from the entity\u2019s interest of CU1,000 until that interest is exhausted.\nThe fair value of the loans at the date of the transaction is CU10,100 and the fair value of the excess spread\nof 0.5 per cent is CU40.  \nThe entity determines that it has transferred some significant risks and rewards of ownership (for example,\nsignificant prepayment risk) but has also retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership (because\nof its subordinated retained interest) and has retained control. It therefore applies the continuing\ninvolvement approach.  \nTo apply this Standard, the entity analyses the transaction as (a) a retention of a fully proportionate retained\ninterest of CU1,000, plus (b) the subordination of that retained interest to provide credit enhancement to\nthe transferee for credit losses.  \nThe entity calculates that CU9,090 (90 per cent \u00d7 CU10,100) of the consideration received of CU9,115\nrepresents the consideration for a fully proportionate 90 per cent share. The remainder of the consideration\nreceived (CU25) represents consideration received for subordinating its retained interest to provide credit\nenhancement to the transferee for credit losses. In addition, the excess spread of 0.5 per cent represents\nconsideration received for the credit enhancement. Accordingly, the total consideration received for the\ncredit enhancement is CU65 (CU25 + CU40).  \nThe entity calculates the gain or loss on the sale of the 90 per cent share of cash flows.

        "page_content=": "### The entity\u2019s business model for managing financial assets\nB4.1.1 Paragraph 4.1.1(a) requires an entity to classify financial assets on the basis of the entity\u2019s business model\nfor managing the financial assets, unless paragraph 4.1.5 applies. An entity assesses whether its financial\nassets meet the condition in paragraph 4.1.2(a) or the condition in paragraph 4.1.2A(a) on the basis of the\nbusiness model as determined by the entity\u2019s key management personnel (as defined in AASB 124 Related\n_Party Disclosures)._  \nB4.1.2 An entity\u2019s business model is determined at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed\ntogether to achieve a particular business objective. The entity\u2019s business model does not depend on\nmanagement\u2019s intentions for an individual instrument. Accordingly, this condition is not an instrument-byinstrument approach to classification and should be determined on a higher level of aggregation. However,\na single entity may have more than one business model for managing its financial instruments.\nConsequently, classification need not be determined at the reporting entity level. For example, an entity\nmay hold a portfolio of investments that it manages in order to collect contractual cash flows and another\nportfolio of investments that it manages in order to trade to realise fair value changes. Similarly, in some\ncircumstances, it may be appropriate to separate a portfolio of financial assets into subportfolios in order to\nreflect the level at which an entity manages those financial assets. For example, that may be the case if an\nentity originates or purchases a portfolio of mortgage loans and manages some of the loans with an\nobjective of collecting contractual cash flows and manages the other loans with an objective of selling them.  \nB4.1.2A An entity\u2019s business model refers to how an entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash  \nflows. That is, the entity\u2019s business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting\ncontractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both. Consequently, this assessment is not performed on\nthe basis of scenarios that the entity does not reasonably expect to occur, such as so-called \u2018worst case\u2019 or\n\u2018stress case\u2019 scenarios. For example, if an entity expects that it will sell a particular portfolio of financial\nassets only in a stress case scenario, that scenario would not affect the entity\u2019s assessment of the business\nmodel for those assets if the entity reasonably expects that such a scenario will not occur. If cash flows are\nrealised in a way that is different from the entity\u2019s expectations at the date that the entity assessed the\nbusiness model (for example, if the entity sells more or fewer financial assets than it expected when it\nclassified the assets), that does not give rise to a prior period error in the entity\u2019s financial statements (see\nAASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors) nor does it change the_\nclassification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model (ie those assets that the entity\nrecognised in prior periods and still holds) as long as the entity considered all relevant information that was\navailable at the time that it made the business model assessment. However, when an entity assesses the\nbusiness model for newly originated or newly purchased financial assets, it must consider information about\nhow cash flows were realised in the past, along with all other relevant information.  \nB4.1.2B An entity\u2019s business model for managing financial assets is a matter of fact and not merely an assertion. It is  \ntypically observable through the activities that the entity undertakes to achieve the objective of the business\nmodel. An entity will need to use judgement when it assesses its business model for managing financial\nassets and that assessment is not determined by a single factor or activity. Instead, the entity must consider\nall relevant evidence that is available at the date of the assessment. Such relevant evidence includes, but is\nnot limited to:  \n(a) how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business\nmodel are evaluated and reported to the entity\u2019s key management personnel;  \n(b) the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within\nthat business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed; and  \n(c) how managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based\non the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).  \n**_A business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect_**\n**_contractual cash flows_**  \nB4.1.2C Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect  \ncontractual cash flows are managed to realise cash flows by collecting contractual payments over the life of\nthe instrument. That is, the entity manages the assets held within the portfolio to collect those particular\ncontractual cash flows (instead of managing the overall return on the portfolio by both holding and selling\nassets). In determining whether cash flows are going to be realised by collecting the financial assets\u2019  \n-----  contractual cash flows, it is necessary to consider the frequency, value and timing of sales in prior periods,\nthe reasons for those sales and expectations about future sales activity. However sales in themselves do not\ndetermine the business model and therefore cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, information about\npast sales and expectations about future sales provide evidence related to how the entity\u2019s stated objective\nfor managing the financial assets is achieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised. An entity must\nconsider information about past sales within the context of the reasons for those sales and the conditions\nthat existed at that time as compared to current conditions.  \nB4.1.3 Although the objective of an entity\u2019s business model may be to hold financial assets in order to collect\ncontractual cash flows, the entity need not hold all of those instruments until maturity. Thus an entity\u2019s\nbusiness model can be to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows even when sales of financial\nassets occur or are expected to occur in the future.  \nB4.1.3A The business model may be to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows even if the entity sells financial  \nassets when there is an increase in the assets\u2019 credit risk. To determine whether there has been an increase in\nthe assets\u2019 credit risk, the entity considers reasonable and supportable information, including forward\nlooking information. Irrespective of their frequency and value, sales due to an increase in the assets\u2019 credit\nrisk are not inconsistent with a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect\ncontractual cash flows because the credit quality of financial assets is relevant to the entity\u2019s ability to\ncollect contractual cash flows. Credit risk management activities that are aimed at minimising potential\ncredit losses due to credit deterioration are integral to such a business model. Selling a financial asset\nbecause it no longer meets the credit criteria specified in the entity\u2019s documented investment policy is an\nexample of a sale that has occurred due to an increase in credit risk. However, in the absence of such a\npolicy, the entity may demonstrate in other ways that the sale occurred due to an increase in credit risk.  \nB4.1.3B Sales that occur for other reasons, such as sales made to manage credit concentration risk (without an  \nincrease in the assets\u2019 credit risk), may also be consistent with a business model whose objective is to hold\nfinancial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. In particular, such sales may be consistent with a\nbusiness model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows if those\nsales are infrequent (even if significant in value) or insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate\n(even if frequent). If more than an infrequent number of such sales are made out of a portfolio and those\nsales are more than insignificant in value (either individually or in aggregate), the entity needs to assess\nwhether and how such sales are consistent with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows. Whether a\nthird party imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or that activity is at the entity\u2019s discretion, is\nnot relevant to this assessment. An increase in the frequency or value of sales in a particular period is not\nnecessarily inconsistent with an objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows,\nif an entity can explain the reasons for those sales and demonstrate why those sales do not reflect a change\nin the entity\u2019s business model. In addition, sales may be consistent with the objective of holding financial\nassets in order to collect contractual cash flows if the sales are made close to the maturity of the financial\nassets and the proceeds from the sales approximate the collection of the remaining contractual cash flows.  \nB4.1.4 The following are examples of when the objective of an entity\u2019s business model may be to hold financial\nassets to collect the contractual cash flows. This list of examples is not exhaustive. Furthermore, the\nexamples are not intended to discuss all factors that may be relevant to the assessment of the entity\u2019s\nbusiness model nor specify the relative importance of the factors.  \n|Example|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Example 1 An entity holds investments to collect their contractual cash flows. The funding needs of the entity are predictable and the maturity of its financial assets is matched to the entity\u2019s estimated funding needs. The entity performs credit risk management activities with the objective of minimising credit losses. In the past, sales have typically occurred when the financial assets\u2019 credit risk has increased such that the assets no longer meet the credit criteria specified in the entity\u2019s documented investment policy. In addition, infrequent sales have occurred as a result of unanticipated funding needs. Reports to key management personnel focus on the credit quality of the financial assets and the|Although the entity considers, among other information, the financial assets\u2019 fair values from a liquidity perspective (ie the cash amount that would be realised if the entity needs to sell assets), the entity\u2019s objective is to hold the financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows. Sales would not contradict that objective if they were in response to an increase in the assets\u2019 credit risk, for example if the assets no longer meet the credit criteria specified in the entity\u2019s documented investment policy. Infrequent sales resulting from unanticipated funding needs (eg in a stress case scenario) also would not contradict that objective, even if such sales are significant in value.|  \n-----  |Example|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n|contractual return. The entity also monitors fair values of the financial assets, among other information.||\n|Example 2 An entity\u2019s business model is to purchase portfolios of financial assets, such as loans. Those portfolios may or may not include financial assets that are credit impaired. If payment on the loans is not made on a timely basis, the entity attempts to realise the contractual cash flows through various means \u2013 for example, by contacting the debtor by mail, telephone or other methods. The entity\u2019s objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and the entity does not manage any of the loans in this portfolio with an objective of realising cash flows by selling them. In some cases, the entity enters into interest rate swaps to change the interest rate on particular financial assets in a portfolio from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate.|The objective of the entity\u2019s business model is to hold the financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows. The same analysis would apply even if the entity does not expect to receive all of the contractual cash flows (eg some of the financial assets are credit impaired at initial recognition). Moreover, the fact that the entity enters into derivatives to modify the cash flows of the portfolio does not in itself change the entity\u2019s business model.|\n|Example 3 An entity has a business model with the objective of originating loans to customers and subsequently selling those loans to a securitisation vehicle. The securitisation vehicle issues instruments to investors. The originating entity controls the securitisation vehicle and thus consolidates it. The securitisation vehicle collects the contractual cash flows from the loans and passes them on to its investors. It is assumed for the purposes of this example that the loans continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position because they are not derecognised by the securitisation vehicle.|The consolidated group originated the loans with the objective of holding them to collect the contractual cash flows. However, the originating entity has an objective of realising cash flows on the loan portfolio by selling the loans to the securitisation vehicle, so for the purposes of its separate financial statements it would not be considered to be managing this portfolio in order to collect the contractual cash flows.|\n|Example 4 A financial institution holds financial assets to meet liquidity needs in a \u2018stress case\u2019 scenario (eg, a run on the bank\u2019s deposits). The entity does not anticipate selling these assets except in such scenarios. The entity monitors the credit quality of the financial assets and its objective in managing the financial assets is to collect the contractual cash flows. The entity evaluates the performance of the assets on the basis of interest revenue earned and credit losses realised. However, the entity also monitors the fair value of the financial assets from a liquidity perspective to ensure that the cash amount that would be realised if the entity needed to sell the assets in a stress case scenario would be sufficient to meet the entity\u2019s liquidity needs. Periodically, the entity makes sales|The objective of the entity\u2019s business model is to hold the financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. The analysis would not change even if during a previous stress case scenario the entity had sales that were significant in value in order to meet its liquidity needs. Similarly, recurring sales activity that is insignificant in value is not inconsistent with holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. In contrast, if an entity holds financial assets to meet its everyday liquidity needs and meeting that objective involves frequent sales that are significant in value, the objective of the entity\u2019s business model is not to hold the financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. Similarly, if the entity is required by its regulator to routinely sell financial assets to demonstrate that the|  \n-----  |Example|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n|that are insignificant in value to demonstrate liquidity.|assets are liquid, and the value of the assets sold is significant, the entity\u2019s business model is not to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. Whether a third party imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or that activity is at the entity\u2019s discretion, is not relevant to the analysis.|  \n**_A business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual_**\n**_cash flows and selling financial assets_**  \nB4.1.4A An entity may hold financial assets in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting  \ncontractual cash flows and selling financial assets. In this type of business model, the entity\u2019s key\nmanagement personnel have made a decision that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling\nfinancial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business model. There are various objectives\nthat may be consistent with this type of business model. For example, the objective of the business model\nmay be to manage everyday liquidity needs, to maintain a particular interest yield profile or to match the\nduration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding. To achieve such\nan objective, the entity will both collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets.  \nB4.1.4B Compared to a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows,  \nthis business model will typically involve greater frequency and value of sales. This is because selling\nfinancial assets is integral to achieving the business model\u2019s objective instead of being only incidental to it.\nHowever, there is no threshold for the frequency or value of sales that must occur in this business model\nbecause both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving its\nobjective.  \nB4.1.4C The following are examples of when the objective of the entity\u2019s business model may be achieved by both  \ncollecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. This list of examples is not exhaustive.\nFurthermore, the examples are not intended to describe all the factors that may be relevant to the assessment\nof the entity\u2019s business model nor specify the relative importance of the factors.  \n|Example|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Example 5 An entity anticipates capital expenditure in a few years. The entity invests its excess cash in short and long-term financial assets so that it can fund the expenditure when the need arises. Many of the financial assets have contractual lives that exceed the entity\u2019s anticipated investment period. The entity will hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows and, when an opportunity arises, it will sell financial assets to re-invest the cash in financial assets with a higher return. The managers responsible for the portfolio are remunerated based on the overall return generated by the portfolio.|The objective of the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. The entity will make decisions on an ongoing basis about whether collecting contractual cash flows or selling financial assets will maximise the return on the portfolio until the need arises for the invested cash. In contrast, consider an entity that anticipates a cash outflow in five years to fund capital expenditure and invests excess cash in short-term financial assets. When the investments mature, the entity reinvests the cash in new short-term financial assets. The entity maintains this strategy until the funds are needed, at which time the entity uses the proceeds from the maturing financial assets to fund the capital expenditure. Only sales that are insignificant in value occur before maturity (unless there is an increase in credit risk). The objective of this contrasting business model is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.|\n|Example 6 A financial institution holds financial assets to meet its everyday liquidity needs.

As a result, the entity holds financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and sells financial assets to reinvest in higher yielding financial assets or to better match the duration of its liabilities.

The insurer uses the proceeds from the contractual cash flows on the financial assets to settle insurance contract liabilities as they come due. To ensure that the contractual cash flows from the financial assets are sufficient to settle those liabilities, the insurer undertakes significant buying and selling activity on a regular basis to rebalance its portfolio of assets and to meet cash flow needs as they arise.|The objective of the business model is to fund the insurance contract liabilities. To achieve this objective, the entity collects contractual cash flows as they come due and sells financial assets to maintain the desired profile of the asset portfolio. Thus both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the business model\u2019s objective.|  \n**_Other business models_**  \nB4.1.5 Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss if they are not held within a business model\nwhose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or within a business model whose\nobjective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (but see also\nparagraph 5.7.5). One business model that results in measurement at fair value through profit or loss is one\nin which an entity manages the financial assets with the objective of realising cash flows through the sale of\nthe assets. The entity makes decisions based on the assets\u2019 fair values and manages the assets to realise\nthose fair values. In this case, the entity\u2019s objective will typically result in active buying and selling. Even\nthough the entity will collect contractual cash flows while it holds the financial assets, the objective of such\na business model is not achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. This\nis because the collection of contractual cash flows is not integral to achieving the business model\u2019s\nobjective; instead, it is incidental to it.  \nB4.1.6 A portfolio of financial assets that is managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis (as\ndescribed in paragraph 4.2.2(b)) is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect\ncontractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. The entity is primarily focused on fair value information\nand uses that information to assess the assets\u2019 performance and to make decisions. In addition, a portfolio of\nfinancial assets that meets the definition of held for trading is not held to collect contractual cash flows or\nheld both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. For such portfolios, the collection of\ncontractual cash flows is only incidental to achieving the business model\u2019s objective. Consequently, such\nportfolios of financial assets must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.  \n**Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on**\n**the principal amount outstanding**  \nB4.1.7 Paragraph 4.1.1(b) requires an entity to classify a financial asset on the basis of its contractual cash flow\ncharacteristics if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to\ncollect contractual cash flows or within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting\ncontractual cash flows and selling financial assets, unless paragraph 4.1.5 applies. To do so, the condition in\nparagraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b) requires an entity to determine whether the asset\u2019s contractual cash flows\nare solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.  \nB4.1.7A Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount  \noutstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In a basic lending arrangement, consideration\nfor the time value of money (see paragraphs B4.1.9A\u2013B4.1.9E) and credit risk are typically the most\nsignificant elements of interest. However, in such an arrangement, interest can also include consideration\nfor other basic lending risks (for example, liquidity risk) and costs (for example, administrative costs)\nassociated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In addition, interest can include a\nprofit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In extreme economic circumstances,  \n-----  interest can be negative if, for example, the holder of a financial asset either explicitly or implicitly pays for\nthe deposit of its money for a particular period of time (and that fee exceeds the consideration that the\nholder receives for the time value of money, credit risk and other basic lending risks and costs). However,\ncontractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is unrelated\nto a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not\ngive rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding. An originated or a purchased financial asset can be a basic lending arrangement irrespective of\nwhether it is a loan in its legal form.  \nB4.1.7B In accordance with paragraph 4.1.3(a), principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition.  \nHowever that principal amount may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are\nrepayments of principal).  \nB4.1.8 An entity shall assess whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the\nprincipal amount outstanding for the currency in which the financial asset is denominated.  \nB4.1.9 Leverage is a contractual cash flow characteristic of some financial assets. Leverage increases the\nvariability of the contractual cash flows with the result that they do not have the economic characteristics of\ninterest. Stand-alone option, forward and swap contracts are examples of financial assets that include such\nleverage. Thus, such contracts do not meet the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b) and cannot be\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income.  \n**_Consideration for the time value of money_**  \nB4.1.9A Time value of money is the element of interest that provides consideration for only the passage of time.  \nThat is, the time value of money element does not provide consideration for other risks or costs associated\nwith holding the financial asset. In order to assess whether the element provides consideration for only the\npassage of time, an entity applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which\nthe financial asset is denominated and the period for which the interest rate is set.  \nB4.1.9B However, in some cases, the time value of money element may be modified (ie imperfect). That would be  \nthe case, for example, if a financial asset\u2019s interest rate is periodically reset but the frequency of that reset\ndoes not match the tenor of the interest rate (for example, the interest rate resets every month to a one-year\nrate) or if a financial asset\u2019s interest rate is periodically reset to an average of particular short- and long-term\ninterest rates. In such cases, an entity must assess the modification to determine whether the contractual\ncash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In some\ncircumstances, the entity may be able to make that determination by performing a qualitative assessment of\nthe time value of money element whereas, in other circumstances, it may be necessary to perform a\nquantitative assessment.  \nB4.1.9C When assessing a modified time value of money element, the objective is to determine how different the  \ncontractual (undiscounted) cash flows could be from the (undiscounted) cash flows that would arise if the\ntime value of money element was not modified (the benchmark cash flows). For example, if the financial\nasset under assessment contains a variable interest rate that is reset every month to a one-year interest rate,\nthe entity would compare that financial asset to a financial instrument with identical contractual terms and\nthe identical credit risk except the variable interest rate is reset monthly to a one-month interest rate. If the\nmodified time value of money element could result in contractual (undiscounted) cash flows that are\nsignificantly different from the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows, the financial asset does not meet the\ncondition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b). To make this determination, the entity must consider the\neffect of the modified time value of money element in each reporting period and cumulatively over the life\nof the financial instrument. The reason for the interest rate being set in this way is not relevant to the\nanalysis. If it is clear, with little or no analysis, whether the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows on the\nfinancial asset under the assessment could (or could not) be significantly different from the (undiscounted)\nbenchmark cash flows, an entity need not perform a detailed assessment.  \nB4.1.9D When assessing a modified time value of money element, an entity must consider factors that could affect  \nfuture contractual cash flows. For example, if an entity is assessing a bond with a five-year term and the\nvariable interest rate is reset every six months to a five-year rate, the entity cannot conclude that the\ncontractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\nsimply because the interest rate curve at the time of the assessment is such that the difference between a\nfive-year interest rate and a six-month interest rate is not significant. Instead, the entity must also consider\nwhether the relationship between the five-year interest rate and the six-month interest rate could change\nover the life of the instrument such that the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows over the life of the\ninstrument could be significantly different from the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows. However, an\nentity must consider only reasonably possible scenarios instead of every possible scenario. If an entity\nconcludes that the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows could be significantly different from the\n(undiscounted) benchmark cash flows, the financial asset does not meet the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b)  \n-----  and 4.1.2A(b) and therefore cannot be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other\ncomprehensive income.  \nB4.1.9E In some jurisdictions, the government or a regulatory authority sets interest rates. For example, such  \ngovernment regulation of interest rates may be part of a broad macroeconomic policy or it may be\nintroduced to encourage entities to invest in a particular sector of the economy. In some of these cases, the\nobjective of the time value of money element is not to provide consideration for only the passage of time.\nHowever, despite paragraphs B4.1.9A\u2013B4.1.9D, a regulated interest rate shall be considered a proxy for the\ntime value of money element for the purpose of applying the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b)\nif that regulated interest rate provides consideration that is broadly consistent with the passage of time and\ndoes not provide exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are inconsistent with a\nbasic lending arrangement.  \n**_Contractual terms that change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows_**  \nB4.1.10 If a financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash  \nflows (for example, if the asset can be prepaid before maturity or its term can be extended), the entity must\ndetermine whether the contractual cash flows that could arise over the life of the instrument due to that\ncontractual term are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. To make\nthis determination, the entity must assess the contractual cash flows that could arise both before, and after,\nthe change in contractual cash flows. The entity may also need to assess the nature of any contingent event\n(ie the trigger) that would change the timing or amount of the contractual cash flows. While the nature of\nthe contingent event in itself is not a determinative factor in assessing whether the contractual cash flows\nare solely payments of principal and interest, it may be an indicator. For example, compare a financial\ninstrument with an interest rate that is reset to a higher rate if the debtor misses a particular number of\npayments to a financial instrument with an interest rate that is reset to a higher rate if a specified equity\nindex reaches a particular level. It is more likely in the former case that the contractual cash flows over the\nlife of the instrument will be solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\nbecause of the relationship between missed payments and an increase in credit risk. (See also\nparagraph B4.1.18.)  \nB4.1.11 The following are examples of contractual terms that result in contractual cash flows that are solely  \npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding:  \n(a) a variable interest rate that consists of consideration for the time value of money, the credit risk\nassociated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time (the\nconsideration for credit risk may be determined at initial recognition only, and so may be fixed)\nand other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin;  \n(b) a contractual term that permits the issuer (ie the debtor) to prepay a debt instrument or permits the\nholder (ie the creditor) to put a debt instrument back to the issuer before maturity and the\nprepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the\nprincipal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for the early\ntermination of the contract; and  \n(c) a contractual term that permits the issuer or the holder to extend the contractual term of a debt\ninstrument (ie an extension option) and the terms of the extension option result in contractual\ncash flows during the extension period that are solely payments of principal and interest on the\nprincipal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for the\nextension of the contract.  \nB4.1.12 Despite paragraph B4.1.10, a financial asset that would otherwise meet the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b)  \nand 4.1.2A(b) but does not do so only as a result of a contractual term that permits (or requires) the issuer to\nprepay a debt instrument or permits (or requires) the holder to put a debt instrument back to the issuer\nbefore maturity is eligible to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive\nincome (subject to meeting the condition in paragraph 4.1.2(a) or the condition in paragraph 4.1.2A(a)) if:  \n(a) the entity acquires or originates the financial asset at a premium or discount to the contractual par\namount;  \n(b) the prepayment amount substantially represents the contractual par amount and accrued (but\nunpaid) contractual interest, which may include reasonable compensation for the early\ntermination of the contract; and  \n(c) when the entity initially recognises the financial asset, the fair value of the prepayment feature is\ninsignificant.  \nB4.1.12A For the purpose of applying paragraphs B4.1.11(b) and B4.1.12(b), irrespective of the event or circumstance  \nthat causes the early termination of the contract, a party may pay or receive reasonable compensation for  \n-----  that early termination. For example, a party may pay or receive reasonable compensation when it chooses to\nterminate the contract early (or otherwise causes the early termination to occur).  \nB4.1.13 The following examples illustrate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest  \non the principal amount outstanding. This list of examples is not exhaustive.  \n|Instrument|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Instrument A Instrument A is a bond with a stated maturity date. Payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are linked to an inflation index of the currency in which the instrument is issued. The inflation link is not leveraged and the principal is protected.|The contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Linking payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding to an unleveraged inflation index resets the time value of money to a current level. In other words, the interest rate on the instrument reflects \u2018real\u2019 interest. Thus, the interest amounts are consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount outstanding. However, if the interest payments were indexed to another variable such as the debtor\u2019s performance (eg the debtor\u2019s net income) or an equity index, the contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (unless the indexing to the debtor\u2019s performance results in an adjustment that only compensates the holder for changes in the credit risk of the instrument, such that contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest). That is because the contractual cash flows reflect a return that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement (see paragraph B4.1.7A).|\n|Instrument B Instrument B is a variable interest rate instrument with a stated maturity date that permits the borrower to choose the market interest rate on an ongoing basis. For example, at each interest rate reset date, the borrower can choose to pay three-month LIBOR for a three-month term or one-month LIBOR for a one-month term.|The contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding as long as the interest paid over the life of the instrument reflects consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the instrument and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin (see paragraph B4.1.7A). The fact that the LIBOR interest rate is reset during the life of the instrument does not in itself disqualify the instrument. However, if the borrower is able to choose to pay a one-month interest rate that is reset every three months, the interest rate is reset with a frequency that does not match the tenor of the interest rate. Consequently, the time value of money element is modified. Similarly, if an instrument has a contractual interest rate that is based on a term that can exceed the instrument\u2019s remaining life (for example, if an instrument with a five-year maturity pays a variable rate that is reset periodically but always reflects a five-year maturity), the time value of money element is modified. That is because the interest payable in each period is disconnected from the interest period. In such cases, the entity must qualitatively or quantitatively assess the contractual cash flows against those on an instrument that is identical in all respects except the tenor of the interest rate matches the interest period to determine if the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. (But see paragraph|  \n-----  |Instrument|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n||B4.1.9E for guidance on regulated interest rates.) For example, in assessing a bond with a five-year term that pays a variable rate that is reset every six months but always reflects a five-year maturity, an entity considers the contractual cash flows on an instrument that resets every six months to a six- month interest rate but is otherwise identical. The same analysis would apply if the borrower is able to choose between the lender\u2019s various published interest rates (eg the borrower can choose between the lender\u2019s published one-month variable interest rate and the lender\u2019s published three-month variable interest rate).|\n|Instrument C Instrument C is a bond with a stated maturity date and pays a variable market interest rate. That variable interest rate is capped.|The contractual cash flows of both: (a) an instrument that has a fixed interest rate and (b) an instrument that has a variable interest rate are payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding as long as the interest reflects consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the instrument during the term of the instrument and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin. (See paragraph B4.1.7A) Consequently, an instrument that is a combination of (a) and (b) (eg a bond with an interest rate cap) can have cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Such a contractual term may reduce cash flow variability by setting a limit on a variable interest rate (eg an interest rate cap or floor) or increase the cash flow variability because a fixed rate becomes variable.|\n|Instrument D Instrument D is a full recourse loan and is secured by collateral.|The fact that a full recourse loan is collateralised does not in itself affect the analysis of whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.|\n|Instrument E Instrument E is issued by a regulated bank and has a stated maturity date. The instrument pays a fixed interest rate and all contractual cash flows are non- discretionary. However, the issuer is subject to legislation that permits or requires a national resolving authority to impose losses on holders of particular instruments, including Instrument E, in particular circumstances. For example, the national resolving authority has the power to write down the par amount of Instrument E or to convert it into a fixed number of the issuer\u2019s ordinary shares if the national resolving authority determines that the issuer is having severe financial difficulties, needs additional regulatory capital or is \u2018failing\u2019.|The holder would analyse the contractual terms of the financial instrument to determine whether they give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and thus are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. That analysis would not consider the payments that arise only as a result of the national resolving authority\u2019s power to impose losses on the holders of Instrument E. That is because that power, and the resulting payments, are not contractual terms of the financial instrument. In contrast, the contractual cash flows would not be solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if the contractual terms of the financial instrument permit or require the issuer or another entity to impose losses on the holder (eg by writing down the par amount or by|  \n-----  |Instrument|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n||converting the instrument into a fixed number of the issuer\u2019s ordinary shares) as long as those contractual terms are genuine, even if the probability is remote that such a loss will be imposed.|  \nB4.1.14 The following examples illustrate contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and  \ninterest on the principal amount outstanding. This list of examples is not exhaustive.  \n|Instrument|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n|Instrument F Instrument F is a bond that is convertible into a fixed number of equity instruments of the issuer.|The holder would analyse the convertible bond in its entirety. The contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding because they reflect a return that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement (see paragraph B4.1.7A); ie the return is linked to the value of the equity of the issuer.|\n|Instrument G Instrument G is a loan that pays an inverse floating interest rate (ie the interest rate has an inverse relationship to market interest rates).|The contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The interest amounts are not consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount outstanding.|\n|Instrument H Instrument H is a perpetual instrument but the issuer may call the instrument at any point and pay the holder the par amount plus accrued interest due. Instrument H pays a market interest rate but payment of interest cannot be made unless the issuer is able to remain solvent immediately afterwards. Deferred interest does not accrue additional interest.|The contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. That is because the issuer may be required to defer interest payments and additional interest does not accrue on those deferred interest amounts. As a result, interest amounts are not consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount outstanding. If interest accrued on the deferred amounts, the contractual cash flows could be payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The fact that Instrument H is perpetual does not in itself mean that the contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In effect, a perpetual instrument has continuous (multiple) extension options. Such options may result in contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if interest payments are mandatory and must be paid in perpetuity. Also, the fact that Instrument H is callable does not mean that the contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding unless it is callable at an amount that does not substantially reflect payment of outstanding principal and interest on that principal amount outstanding. Even if the callable amount includes an amount that reasonably compensates the holder for the early termination of the instrument, the contractual cash flows could be payments of principal and interest on the principal amount|  \n-----  |Instrument|Analysis|\n|---|---|\n||outstanding. (See also paragraph B4.1.12.)|  \nB4.1.15 In some cases a financial asset may have contractual cash flows that are described as principal and interest  \nbut those cash flows do not represent the payment of principal and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding as described in paragraphs 4.1.2(b), 4.1.2A(b) and 4.1.3 of this Standard.  \nB4.1.16 This may be the case if the financial asset represents an investment in particular assets or cash flows and  \nhence the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding. For example, if the contractual terms stipulate that the financial asset\u2019s cash flows increase as\nmore automobiles use a particular toll road, those contractual cash flows are inconsistent with a basic\nlending arrangement. As a result, the instrument would not satisfy the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and\n4.1.2A(b). This could be the case when a creditor\u2019s claim is limited to specified assets of the debtor or the\ncash flows from specified assets (for example, a \u2018non-recourse\u2019 financial asset).  \nB4.1.17 However, the fact that a financial asset is non-recourse does not in itself necessarily preclude the financial  \nasset from meeting the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b). In such situations, the creditor is\nrequired to assess (\u2018look through to\u2019) the particular underlying assets or cash flows to determine whether the\ncontractual cash flows of the financial asset being classified are payments of principal and interest on the\nprincipal amount outstanding. If the terms of the financial asset give rise to any other cash flows or limit the\ncash flows in a manner inconsistent with payments representing principal and interest, the financial asset\ndoes not meet the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b). Whether the underlying assets are\nfinancial assets or non-financial assets does not in itself affect this assessment.  \nB4.1.18 A contractual cash flow characteristic does not affect the classification of the financial asset if it could have  \nonly a de minimis effect on the contractual cash flows of the financial asset. To make this determination, an\nentity must consider the possible effect of the contractual cash flow characteristic in each reporting period\nand cumulatively over the life of the financial instrument. In addition, if a contractual cash flow\ncharacteristic could have an effect on the contractual cash flows that is more than de minimis (either in a\nsingle reporting period or cumulatively) but that cash flow characteristic is not genuine, it does not affect\nthe classification of a financial asset. A cash flow characteristic is not genuine if it affects the instrument\u2019s\ncontractual cash flows only on the occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very\nunlikely to occur.  \nB4.1.19 In almost every lending transaction the creditor\u2019s instrument is ranked relative to the instruments of the  \ndebtor\u2019s other creditors. An instrument that is subordinated to other instruments may have contractual cash\nflows that are payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if the debtor\u2019s nonpayment is a breach of contract and the holder has a contractual right to unpaid amounts of principal and\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding even in the event of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy. For example, a\ntrade receivable that ranks its creditor as a general creditor would qualify as having payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding. This is the case even if the debtor issued loans that are\ncollateralised, which in the event of bankruptcy would give that loan holder priority over the claims of the\ngeneral creditor in respect of the collateral but does not affect the contractual right of the general creditor to\nunpaid principal and other amounts due.  \n**_Contractually linked instruments_**  \nB4.1.20 In some types of transactions, an issuer may prioritise payments to the holders of financial assets using  \nmultiple contractually linked instruments that create concentrations of credit risk (tranches). Each tranche\nhas a subordination ranking that specifies the order in which any cash flows generated by the issuer are\nallocated to the tranche. In such situations, the holders of a tranche have the right to payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding only if the issuer generates sufficient cash flows to satisfy\nhigher-ranking tranches.  \nB4.1.21 In such transactions, a tranche has cash flow characteristics that are payments of principal and interest on  \nthe principal amount outstanding only if:  \n(a) the contractual terms of the tranche being assessed for classification (without looking through to\nthe underlying pool of financial instruments) give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (eg the interest rate on the tranche is\nnot linked to a commodity index);  \n(b) the underlying pool of financial instruments has the cash flow characteristics set out in paragraphs\nB4.1.23 and B4.1.24; and  \n-----  (c) the exposure to credit risk in the underlying pool of financial instruments inherent in the tranche\nis equal to or lower than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments\n(for example, the credit rating of the tranche being assessed for classification is equal to or higher\nthan the credit rating that would apply to a single tranche that funded the underlying pool of\nfinancial instruments).  \nB4.1.22 An entity must look through until it can identify the underlying pool of instruments that are creating  \n(instead of passing through) the cash flows. This is the underlying pool of financial instruments.  \nB4.1.23 The underlying pool must contain one or more instruments that have contractual cash flows that are solely  \npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.  \nB4.1.24 The underlying pool of instruments may also include instruments that:  \n(a) reduce the cash flow variability of the instruments in paragraph B4.1.23 and, when combined\nwith the instruments in paragraph B4.1.23, result in cash flows that are solely payments of\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (eg an interest rate cap or floor or a\ncontract that reduces the credit risk on some or all of the instruments in paragraph B4.1.23); or  \n(b) align the cash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the pool of underlying instruments in\nparagraph B4.1.23 to address differences in and only in:  \n(i) whether the interest rate is fixed or floating;  \n(ii) the currency in which the cash flows are denominated, including inflation in that\ncurrency; or  \n(iii) the timing of the cash flows.  \nB4.1.25 If any instrument in the pool does not meet the conditions in either paragraph B4.1.23 or paragraph B4.1.24,  \nthe condition in paragraph B4.1.21(b) is not met. In performing this assessment, a detailed instrument-byinstrument analysis of the pool may not be necessary. However, an entity must use judgement and perform\nsufficient analysis to determine whether the instruments in the pool meet the conditions in paragraphs\nB4.1.23\u2013B4.1.24. (See also paragraph B4.1.18 for guidance on contractual cash flow characteristics that\nhave only a de minimis effect.)  \nB4.1.26 If the holder cannot assess the conditions in paragraph B4.1.21 at initial recognition, the tranche must be  \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss. If the underlying pool of instruments can change after initial\nrecognition in such a way that the pool may not meet the conditions in paragraphs B4.1.23\u2013B4.1.24, the\ntranche does not meet the conditions in paragraph B4.1.21 and must be measured at fair value through profit\nor loss. However, if the underlying pool includes instruments that are collateralised by assets that do not\nmeet the conditions in paragraphs B4.1.23\u2013B4.1.24, the ability to take possession of such assets shall be\ndisregarded for the purposes of applying this paragraph unless the entity acquired the tranche with the\nintention of controlling the collateral.",

In such circumstances, an entity may conclude that its financial statements would\nprovide more relevant information if both the asset and the liability were measured as at fair value through\nprofit or loss.  \nB4.1.30 The following examples show when this condition could be met. In all cases, an entity may use this  \ncondition to designate financial assets or financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss only if it\nmeets the principle in paragraph 4.1.5 or 4.2.2(a):  \n(a) an entity has contracts within the scope of AASB 17 (the measurement of which incorporates\ncurrent information) and financial assets that it considers to be related and that would otherwise\nbe measured at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost.  \n(b) an entity has financial assets, financial liabilities or both that share a risk, such as interest rate\nrisk, and that gives rise to opposite changes in fair value that tend to offset each other. However,\nonly some of the instruments would be measured at fair value through profit or loss (for example,\nthose that are derivatives, or are classified as held for trading). It may also be the case that the\nrequirements for hedge accounting are not met because, for example, the requirements for hedge\neffectiveness in paragraph 6.4.1 are not met.  \n(c) an entity has financial assets, financial liabilities or both that share a risk, such as interest rate\nrisk, that gives rise to opposite changes in fair value that tend to offset each other and none of the\nfinancial assets or financial liabilities qualifies for designation as a hedging instrument because\nthey are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Furthermore, in the absence of hedge\naccounting there is a significant inconsistency in the recognition of gains and losses. For example,\nthe entity has financed a specified group of loans by issuing traded bonds whose changes in fair\nvalue tend to offset each other. If, in addition, the entity regularly buys and sells the bonds but\nrarely, if ever, buys and sells the loans, reporting both the loans and the bonds at fair value\nthrough profit or loss eliminates the inconsistency in the timing of the recognition of the gains\nand losses that would otherwise result from measuring them both at amortised cost and\nrecognising a gain or loss each time a bond is repurchased.  \nB4.1.31 In cases such as those described in the preceding paragraph, to designate, at initial recognition, the financial  \nassets and financial liabilities not otherwise so measured as at fair value through profit or loss may\neliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistency and produce more relevant\ninformation. For practical purposes, the entity need not enter into all of the assets and liabilities giving rise\nto the measurement or recognition inconsistency at exactly the same time. A reasonable delay is permitted\nprovided that each transaction is designated as at fair value through profit or loss at its initial recognition\nand, at that time, any remaining transactions are expected to occur.  \nB4.1.32 It would not be acceptable to designate only some of the financial assets and financial liabilities giving rise  \nto the inconsistency as at fair value through profit or loss if to do so would not eliminate or significantly\nreduce the inconsistency and would therefore not result in more relevant information. However, it would be\nacceptable to designate only some of a number of similar financial assets or similar financial liabilities if\ndoing so achieves a significant reduction (and possibly a greater reduction than other allowable\ndesignations) in the inconsistency. For example, assume an entity has a number of similar financial\nliabilities that sum to CU100 and a number of similar financial assets that sum to CU50 but are measured on\na different basis. The entity may significantly reduce the measurement inconsistency by designating at\ninitial recognition all of the assets but only some of the liabilities (for example, individual liabilities with a\ncombined total of CU45) as at fair value through profit or loss. However, because designation as at fair\nvalue through profit or loss can be applied only to the whole of a financial instrument, the entity in this\nexample must designate one or more liabilities in their entirety. It could not designate either a component of\na liability (eg changes in value attributable to only one risk, such as changes in a benchmark interest rate) or\na proportion (ie percentage) of a liability.  \n**A group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is**\n**managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis**  \nB4.1.33 An entity may manage and evaluate the performance of a group of financial liabilities or financial assets  \nand financial liabilities in such a way that measuring that group at fair value through profit or loss results in\nmore relevant information. The focus in this instance is on the way the entity manages and evaluates\nperformance, instead of on the nature of its financial instruments.  \nB4.1.34 For example, an entity may use this condition to designate financial liabilities as at fair value through profit  \nor loss if it meets the principle in paragraph 4.2.2(b) and the entity has financial assets and financial\nliabilities that share one or more risks and those risks are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in  \n-----  accordance with a documented policy of asset and liability management. An example could be an entity that\nhas issued \u2018structured products\u2019 containing multiple embedded derivatives and manages the resulting risks\non a fair value basis using a mix of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.  \nB4.1.35 As noted above, this condition relies on the way the entity manages and evaluates performance of the group  \nof financial instruments under consideration. Accordingly, (subject to the requirement of designation at\ninitial recognition) an entity that designates financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss on the\nbasis of this condition shall so designate all eligible financial liabilities that are managed and evaluated\ntogether.  \nB4.1.36 Documentation of the entity\u2019s strategy need not be extensive but should be sufficient to demonstrate  \ncompliance with paragraph 4.2.2(b). Such documentation is not required for each individual item, but may\nbe on a portfolio basis. For example, if the performance management system for a department \u2013 as approved\nby the entity\u2019s key management personnel \u2013 clearly demonstrates that its performance is evaluated on this\nbasis, no further documentation is required to demonstrate compliance with paragraph 4.2.2(b).",

        "page_content=": "## Embedded derivatives (Section 4.3)  \nB4.3.1 When an entity becomes a party to a hybrid contract with a host that is not an asset within the scope of this\nStandard, paragraph 4.3.3 requires the entity to identify any embedded derivative, assess whether it is\nrequired to be separated from the host contract and, for those that are required to be separated, measure the\nderivatives at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.  \nB4.3.2 If a host contract has no stated or predetermined maturity and represents a residual interest in the net assets\nof an entity, then its economic characteristics and risks are those of an equity instrument, and an embedded\nderivative would need to possess equity characteristics related to the same entity to be regarded as closely\nrelated. If the host contract is not an equity instrument and meets the definition of a financial instrument,\nthen its economic characteristics and risks are those of a debt instrument.  \nB4.3.3 An embedded non-option derivative (such as an embedded forward or swap) is separated from its host\ncontract on the basis of its stated or implied substantive terms, so as to result in it having a fair value of zero\nat initial recognition. An embedded option-based derivative (such as an embedded put, call, cap, floor or\nswaption) is separated from its host contract on the basis of the stated terms of the option feature. The initial\ncarrying amount of the host instrument is the residual amount after separating the embedded derivative.  \nB4.3.4 Generally, multiple embedded derivatives in a single hybrid contract are treated as a single compound\nembedded derivative. However, embedded derivatives that are classified as equity (see AASB 132\n_Financial Instruments: Presentation) are accounted for separately from those classified as assets or_\nliabilities. In addition, if a hybrid contract has more than one embedded derivative and those derivatives\nrelate to different risk exposures and are readily separable and independent of each other, they are\naccounted for separately from each other.  \nB4.3.5 The economic characteristics and risks of an embedded derivative are not closely related to the host contract\n(paragraph 4.3.3(a)) in the following examples. In these examples, assuming the conditions in paragraph\n4.3.3(b) and (c) are met, an entity accounts for the embedded derivative separately from the host contract.  \n(a) A put option embedded in an instrument that enables the holder to require the issuer to reacquire\nthe instrument for an amount of cash or other assets that varies on the basis of the change in an\nequity or commodity price or index is not closely related to a host debt instrument.  \n(b) An option or automatic provision to extend the remaining term to maturity of a debt instrument is\nnot closely related to the host debt instrument unless there is a concurrent adjustment to the\napproximate current market rate of interest at the time of the extension. If an entity issues a debt\ninstrument and the holder of that debt instrument writes a call option on the debt instrument to a\nthird party, the issuer regards the call option as extending the term to maturity of the debt\ninstrument provided the issuer can be required to participate in or facilitate the remarketing of the\ndebt instrument as a result of the call option being exercised.  \n(c) Equity-indexed interest or principal payments embedded in a host debt instrument or insurance\ncontract \u2013 by which the amount of interest or principal is indexed to the value of equity\ninstruments \u2013 are not closely related to the host instrument because the risks inherent in the host\nand the embedded derivative are dissimilar.  \n(d) Commodity-indexed interest or principal payments embedded in a host debt instrument or\ninsurance contract \u2013 by which the amount of interest or principal is indexed to the price of a\ncommodity (such as gold) \u2013 are not closely related to the host instrument because the risks\ninherent in the host and the embedded derivative are dissimilar.  \n-----  (e) A call, put, or prepayment option embedded in a host debt contract or host insurance contract is\nnot closely related to the host contract unless:  \n(i) the option\u2019s exercise price is approximately equal on each exercise date to the\namortised cost of the host debt instrument or the carrying amount of the host insurance\ncontract; or  \n(ii) the exercise price of a prepayment option reimburses the lender for an amount up to the\napproximate present value of lost interest for the remaining term of the host contract.\nLost interest is the product of the principal amount prepaid multiplied by the interest\nrate differential. The interest rate differential is the excess of the effective interest rate\nof the host contract over the effective interest rate the entity would receive at the\nprepayment date if it reinvested the principal amount prepaid in a similar contract for\nthe remaining term of the host contract.  \nThe assessment of whether the call or put option is closely related to the host debt contract is\nmade before separating the equity element of a convertible debt instrument in accordance with\nAASB 132.  \n(f) Credit derivatives that are embedded in a host debt instrument and allow one party (the\n\u2018beneficiary\u2019) to transfer the credit risk of a particular reference asset, which it may not own, to\nanother party (the \u2018guarantor\u2019) are not closely related to the host debt instrument. Such credit\nderivatives allow the guarantor to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset\nwithout directly owning it.  \nB4.3.6 An example of a hybrid contract is a financial instrument that gives the holder a right to put the financial\ninstrument back to the issuer in exchange for an amount of cash or other financial assets that varies on the\nbasis of the change in an equity or commodity index that may increase or decrease (a \u2018puttable instrument\u2019).\nUnless the issuer on initial recognition designates the puttable instrument as a financial liability at fair value\nthrough profit or loss, it is required to separate an embedded derivative (ie the indexed principal payment)\nunder paragraph 4.3.3 because the host contract is a debt instrument under paragraph B4.3.2 and the\nindexed principal payment is not closely related to a host debt instrument under paragraph B4.3.5(a).\nBecause the principal payment can increase and decrease, the embedded derivative is a non-option\nderivative whose value is indexed to the underlying variable.  \nB4.3.7 In the case of a puttable instrument that can be put back at any time for cash equal to a proportionate share\nof the net asset value of an entity (such as units of an open-ended mutual fund or some unit-linked\ninvestment products), the effect of separating an embedded derivative and accounting for each component is\nto measure the hybrid contract at the redemption amount that is payable at the end of the reporting period if\nthe holder exercised its right to put the instrument back to the issuer.  \nB4.3.8 The economic characteristics and risks of an embedded derivative are closely related to the economic\ncharacteristics and risks of the host contract in the following examples. In these examples, an entity does\nnot account for the embedded derivative separately from the host contract.  \n(a) An embedded derivative in which the underlying is an interest rate or interest rate index that can\nchange the amount of interest that would otherwise be paid or received on an interest-bearing host\ndebt contract or insurance contract is closely related to the host contract unless the hybrid contract\ncan be settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recognised\ninvestment or the embedded derivative could at least double the holder\u2019s initial rate of return on\nthe host contract and could result in a rate of return that is at least twice what the market return\nwould be for a contract with the same terms as the host contract.  \n(b) An embedded floor or cap on the interest rate on a debt contract or insurance contract is closely\nrelated to the host contract, provided the cap is at or above the market rate of interest and the floor\nis at or below the market rate of interest when the contract is issued, and the cap or floor is not\nleveraged in relation to the host contract. Similarly, provisions included in a contract to purchase\nor sell an asset (eg a commodity) that establish a cap and a floor on the price to be paid or\nreceived for the asset are closely related to the host contract if both the cap and floor were out of\nthe money at inception and are not leveraged.  \n(c) An embedded foreign currency derivative that provides a stream of principal or interest payments\nthat are denominated in a foreign currency and is embedded in a host debt instrument (for\nexample, a dual currency bond) is closely related to the host debt instrument. Such a derivative is\nnot separated from the host instrument because AASB 121 _The Effects of Changes in Foreign_\n_Exchange Rates requires foreign currency gains and losses on monetary items to be recognised in_\nprofit or loss.  \n-----  (d) An embedded foreign currency derivative in a host contract that is an insurance contract or not a\nfinancial instrument (such as a contract for the purchase or sale of a non-financial item where the\nprice is denominated in a foreign currency) is closely related to the host contract provided it is not\nleveraged, does not contain an option feature, and requires payments denominated in one of the\nfollowing currencies:  \n(i) the functional currency of any substantial party to that contract;  \n(ii) the currency in which the price of the related good or service that is acquired or\ndelivered is routinely denominated in commercial transactions around the world (such\nas the US dollar for crude oil transactions); or  \n(iii) a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in\nthe economic environment in which the transaction takes place (eg a relatively stable\nand liquid currency that is commonly used in local business transactions or external\ntrade).  \n(e) An embedded prepayment option in an interest-only or principal-only strip is closely related to\nthe host contract provided the host contract (i) initially resulted from separating the right to\nreceive contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that, in and of itself, did not contain an\nembedded derivative, and (ii) does not contain any terms not present in the original host debt\ncontract.  \n(f) An embedded derivative in a host lease contract is closely related to the host contract if the\nembedded derivative is (i) an inflation-related index such as an index of lease payments to a\nconsumer price index (provided that the lease is not leveraged and the index relates to inflation in\nthe entity\u2019s own economic environment), (ii) variable lease payments based on related sales or\n(iii) variable lease payments based on variable interest rates.  \n(g) A unit-linking feature embedded in a host financial instrument or host insurance contract is\nclosely related to the host instrument or host contract if the unit-denominated payments are\nmeasured at current unit values that reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund. A unit-linking\nfeature is a contractual term that requires payments denominated in units of an internal or external\ninvestment fund.  \n(h) A derivative embedded in an insurance contract is closely related to the host insurance contract if\nthe embedded derivative and host insurance contract are so interdependent that an entity cannot\nmeasure the embedded derivative separately (ie without considering the host contract).",

The entity\nacquires a company that manages commercial loans and has a business model that holds the loans\nin order to collect the contractual cash flows.

However, if part\nof the consideration given or received is for something other than the financial instrument, an entity shall\nmeasure the fair value of the financial instrument.

An entity distinguishes fees\nand costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate for the financial liability from\norigination fees and transaction costs relating to the right to provide services, such as investment\nmanagement services.  \nB5.4.3 Fees that are not an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument and are accounted for\nin accordance with AASB 15 include:  \n(a) fees charged for servicing a loan;  \n(b) commitment fees to originate a loan when the loan commitment is not measured in accordance\nwith paragraph 4.2.1(a) and it is unlikely that a specific lending arrangement will be entered into;\nand  \n(c) loan syndication fees received by an entity that arranges a loan and retains no part of the loan\npackage for itself (or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for comparable risk as other\nparticipants).  \nB5.4.4 When applying the effective interest method, an entity generally amortises any fees, points paid or received,\ntransaction costs and other premiums or discounts that are included in the calculation of the effective\ninterest rate over the expected life of the financial instrument. However, a shorter period is used if this is the\nperiod to which the fees, points paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate. This will\nbe the case when the variable to which the fees, points paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or\ndiscounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the financial instrument. In such\na case, the appropriate amortisation period is the period to the next such repricing date. For example, if a\npremium or discount on a floating-rate financial instrument reflects the interest that has accrued on that\nfinancial instrument since the interest was last paid, or changes in the market rates since the floating interest\nrate was reset to the market rates, it will be amortised to the next date when the floating interest is reset to\nmarket rates. This is because the premium or discount relates to the period to the next interest reset date\nbecause, at that date, the variable to which the premium or discount relates (ie interest rates) is reset to the\nmarket rates. If, however, the premium or discount results from a change in the credit spread over the\nfloating rate specified in the financial instrument, or other variables that are not reset to the market rates, it\nis amortised over the expected life of the financial instrument.  \nB5.4.5 For floating-rate financial assets and floating-rate financial liabilities, periodic re-estimation of cash flows\nto reflect the movements in the market rates of interest alters the effective interest rate. If a floating-rate\nfinancial asset or a floating-rate financial liability is recognised initially at an amount equal to the principal\nreceivable or payable on maturity, re-estimating the future interest payments normally has no significant\neffect on the carrying amount of the asset or the liability.  \nB5.4.6 If an entity revises its estimates of payments or receipts (excluding modifications in accordance with\nparagraph 5.4.3 and changes in estimates of expected credit losses), it shall adjust the gross carrying amount  \n-----  of the financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability (or group of financial instruments) to reflect\nactual and revised estimated contractual cash flows. The entity recalculates the gross carrying amount of the\nfinancial asset or amortised cost of the financial liability as the present value of the estimated future\ncontractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial instrument\u2019s original effective interest rate (or\ncredit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when\napplicable, the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10. The\nadjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.  \nB5.4.7 In some cases a financial asset is considered credit-impaired at initial recognition because the credit risk is\nvery high, and in the case of a purchase it is acquired at a deep discount. An entity is required to include the\ninitial expected credit losses in the estimated cash flows when calculating the credit-adjusted effective\ninterest rate for financial assets that are considered to be purchased or originated credit-impaired at initial\nrecognition. However, this does not mean that a credit-adjusted effective interest rate should be applied\nsolely because the financial asset has high credit risk at initial recognition.",

This is to ensure that an entity meets the\nobjective of recognising lifetime expected credit losses when there are significant increases in credit risk,\neven if evidence of such significant increases in credit risk at the individual instrument level is not yet\navailable.  \nB5.5.2 Lifetime expected credit losses are generally expected to be recognised before a financial instrument\nbecomes past due. Typically, credit risk increases significantly before a financial instrument becomes past\ndue or other lagging borrower-specific factors (for example, a modification or restructuring) are observed.\nConsequently when reasonable and supportable information that is more forward-looking than past due\ninformation is available without undue cost or effort, it must be used to assess changes in credit risk.  \nB5.5.3 However, depending on the nature of the financial instruments and the credit risk information available for\nparticular groups of financial instruments, an entity may not be able to identify significant changes in credit\nrisk for individual financial instruments before the financial instrument becomes past due. This may be the\ncase for financial instruments such as retail loans for which there is little or no updated credit risk\ninformation that is routinely obtained and monitored on an individual instrument until a customer breaches\nthe contractual terms. If changes in the credit risk for individual financial instruments are not captured\nbefore they become past due, a loss allowance based only on credit information at an individual financial\ninstrument level would not faithfully represent the changes in credit risk since initial recognition.  \nB5.5.4 In some circumstances an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information that is available\nwithout undue cost or effort to measure lifetime expected credit losses on an individual instrument basis. In\nthat case, lifetime expected credit losses shall be recognised on a collective basis that considers\ncomprehensive credit risk information. This comprehensive credit risk information must incorporate not\nonly past due information but also all relevant credit information, including forward-looking\nmacroeconomic information, in order to approximate the result of recognising lifetime expected credit\nlosses when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on an individual\ninstrument level.  \n-----  B5.5.5 For the purpose of determining significant increases in credit risk and recognising a loss allowance on a\ncollective basis, an entity can group financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics\nwith the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to\nbe identified on a timely basis. The entity should not obscure this information by grouping financial\ninstruments with different risk characteristics. Examples of shared credit risk characteristics may include,\nbut are not limited to, the:  \n(a) instrument type;  \n(b) credit risk ratings;  \n(c) collateral type;  \n(d) date of initial recognition;  \n(e) remaining term to maturity;  \n(f) industry;  \n(g) geographical location of the borrower; and  \n(h) the value of collateral relative to the financial asset if it has an impact on the probability of a\ndefault occurring (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loan-to-value ratios).  \nB5.5.6 Paragraph 5.5.4 requires that lifetime expected credit losses are recognised on all financial instruments for\nwhich there has been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. In order to meet this\nobjective, if an entity is not able to group financial instruments for which the credit risk is considered to\nhave increased significantly since initial recognition based on shared credit risk characteristics, the entity\nshould recognise lifetime expected credit losses on a portion of the financial assets for which credit risk is\ndeemed to have increased significantly. The aggregation of financial instruments to assess whether there are\nchanges in credit risk on a collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available on\ngroups of, or individual, financial instruments.",

        "page_content=": "### Timing of recognising lifetime expected credit losses\nB5.5.7 The assessment of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised is based on significant\nincreases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition (irrespective of whether a\nfinancial instrument has been repriced to reflect an increase in credit risk) instead of on evidence of a\nfinancial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring. Generally, there\nwill be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit-impaired or an actual\ndefault occurs.  \nB5.5.8 For loan commitments, an entity considers changes in the risk of a default occurring on the loan to which a\nloan commitment relates. For financial guarantee contracts, an entity considers the changes in the risk that\nthe specified debtor will default on the contract.  \nB5.5.9 The significance of a change in the credit risk since initial recognition depends on the risk of a default\noccurring as at initial recognition. Thus, a given change, in absolute terms, in the risk of a default occurring\nwill be more significant for a financial instrument with a lower initial risk of a default occurring compared\nto a financial instrument with a higher initial risk of a default occurring.  \nB5.5.10 The risk of a default occurring on financial instruments that have comparable credit risk is higher the longer  \nthe expected life of the instrument; for example, the risk of a default occurring on an AAA-rated bond with\nan expected life of 10 years is higher than that on an AAA-rated bond with an expected life of five years.  \nB5.5.11 Because of the relationship between the expected life and the risk of a default occurring, the change in  \ncredit risk cannot be assessed simply by comparing the change in the absolute risk of a default occurring\nover time. For example, if the risk of a default occurring for a financial instrument with an expected life of\n10 years at initial recognition is identical to the risk of a default occurring on that financial instrument when\nits expected life in a subsequent period is only five years, that may indicate an increase in credit risk. This is\nbecause the risk of a default occurring over the expected life usually decreases as time passes if the credit\nrisk is unchanged and the financial instrument is closer to maturity. However, for financial instruments that\nonly have significant payment obligations close to the maturity of the financial instrument the risk of a\ndefault occurring may not necessarily decrease as time passes. In such a case, an entity should also consider\nother qualitative factors that would demonstrate whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition.  \nB5.5.12 An entity may apply various approaches when assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument  \nhas increased significantly since initial recognition or when measuring expected credit losses. An entity\nmay apply different approaches for different financial instruments. An approach that does not include an\nexplicit probability of default as an input per se, such as a credit loss rate approach, can be consistent with  \n-----  the requirements in this Standard, provided that an entity is able to separate the changes in the risk of a\ndefault occurring from changes in other drivers of expected credit losses, such as collateral, and considers\nthe following when making the assessment:  \n(a) the change in the risk of a default occurring since initial recognition;  \n(b) the expected life of the financial instrument; and  \n(c) reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort that may\naffect credit risk.  \nB5.5.13 The methods used to determine whether credit risk has increased significantly on a financial instrument  \nsince initial recognition should consider the characteristics of the financial instrument (or group of financial\ninstruments) and the default patterns in the past for comparable financial instruments. Despite the\nrequirement in paragraph 5.5.9, for financial instruments for which default patterns are not concentrated at a\nspecific point during the expected life of the financial instrument, changes in the risk of a default occurring\nover the next 12 months may be a reasonable approximation of the changes in the lifetime risk of a default\noccurring. In such cases, an entity may use changes in the risk of a default occurring over the next 12\nmonths to determine whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, unless\ncircumstances indicate that a lifetime assessment is necessary.  \nB5.5.14 However, for some financial instruments, or in some circumstances, it may not be appropriate to use  \nchanges in the risk of a default occurring over the next 12 months to determine whether lifetime expected\ncredit losses should be recognised. For example, the change in the risk of a default occurring in the next 12\nmonths may not be a suitable basis for determining whether credit risk has increased on a financial\ninstrument with a maturity of more than 12 months when:  \n(a) the financial instrument only has significant payment obligations beyond the next 12 months;  \n(b) changes in relevant macroeconomic or other credit-related factors occur that are not adequately\nreflected in the risk of a default occurring in the next 12 months; or  \n(c) changes in credit-related factors only have an impact on the credit risk of the financial instrument\n(or have a more pronounced effect) beyond 12 months.  \n**Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial**\n**recognition**  \nB5.5.15 When determining whether the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses is required, an entity shall  \nconsider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort and that may\naffect the credit risk on a financial instrument in accordance with paragraph 5.5.17(c). An entity need not\nundertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit risk has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition.  \nB5.5.16 Credit risk analysis is a multifactor and holistic analysis; whether a specific factor is relevant, and its weight  \ncompared to other factors, will depend on the type of product, characteristics of the financial instruments\nand the borrower as well as the geographical region. An entity shall consider reasonable and supportable\ninformation that is available without undue cost or effort and that is relevant for the particular financial\ninstrument being assessed. However, some factors or indicators may not be identifiable on an individual\nfinancial instrument level. In such a case, the factors or indicators should be assessed for appropriate\nportfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of a portfolio of financial instruments to determine whether the\nrequirement in paragraph 5.5.3 for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses has been met.  \nB5.5.17 The following non-exhaustive list of information may be relevant in assessing changes in credit risk:  \n(a) significant changes in internal price indicators of credit risk as a result of a change in credit risk\nsince inception, including, but not limited to, the credit spread that would result if a particular\nfinancial instrument or similar financial instrument with the same terms and the same\ncounterparty were newly originated or issued at the reporting date.  \n(b) other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly\ndifferent if the instrument was newly originated or issued at the reporting date (such as more\nstringent covenants, increased amounts of collateral or guarantees, or higher income coverage)\nbecause of changes in the credit risk of the financial instrument since initial recognition.  \n(c) significant changes in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument\nor similar financial instruments with the same expected life. Changes in market indicators of\ncredit risk include, but are not limited to:  \n(i) the credit spread;  \n(ii) the credit default swap prices for the borrower;  \n-----  (iii) the length of time or the extent to which the fair value of a financial asset has been less\nthan its amortised cost; and  \n(iv) other market information related to the borrower, such as changes in the price of a\nborrower\u2019s debt and equity instruments.  \n(d) an actual or expected significant change in the financial instrument\u2019s external credit rating.  \n(e) an actual or expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural\nscoring used to assess credit risk internally. Internal credit ratings and internal behavioural\nscoring are more reliable when they are mapped to external ratings or supported by default\nstudies.  \n(f) existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are\nexpected to cause a significant change in the borrower\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations, such\nas an actual or expected increase in interest rates or an actual or expected significant increase in\nunemployment rates.  \n(g) an actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the borrower. Examples\ninclude actual or expected declining revenues or margins, increasing operating risks, working\ncapital deficiencies, decreasing asset quality, increased balance sheet leverage, liquidity,\nmanagement problems or changes in the scope of business or organisational structure (such as the\ndiscontinuance of a segment of the business) that results in a significant change in the borrower\u2019s\nability to meet its debt obligations.  \n(h) significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower.  \n(i) an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological\nenvironment of the borrower that results in a significant change in the borrower\u2019s ability to meet\nits debt obligations, such as a decline in the demand for the borrower\u2019s sales product because of a\nshift in technology.  \n(j) significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of\nthird-party guarantees or credit enhancements, which are expected to reduce the borrower\u2019s\neconomic incentive to make scheduled contractual payments or to otherwise have an effect on the\nprobability of a default occurring. For example, if the value of collateral declines because house\nprices decline, borrowers in some jurisdictions have a greater incentive to default on their\nmortgages.  \n(k) a significant change in the quality of the guarantee provided by a shareholder (or an individual\u2019s\nparents) if the shareholder (or parents) have an incentive and financial ability to prevent default\nby capital or cash infusion.  \n(l) significant changes, such as reductions in financial support from a parent entity or other affiliate\nor an actual or expected significant change in the quality of credit enhancement, that are expected\nto reduce the borrower\u2019s economic incentive to make scheduled contractual payments. Credit\nquality enhancements or support include the consideration of the financial condition of the\nguarantor and/or, for interests issued in securitisations, whether subordinated interests are\nexpected to be capable of absorbing expected credit losses (for example, on the loans underlying\nthe security).  \n(m) expected changes in the loan documentation including an expected breach of contract that may\nlead to covenant waivers or amendments, interest payment holidays, interest rate step-ups,\nrequiring additional collateral or guarantees, or other changes to the contractual framework of the\ninstrument.  \n(n) significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, including\nchanges in the payment status of borrowers in the group (for example, an increase in the expected\nnumber or extent of delayed contractual payments or significant increases in the expected number\nof credit card borrowers who are expected to approach or exceed their credit limit or who are\nexpected to be paying the minimum monthly amount).  \n(o) changes in the entity\u2019s credit management approach in relation to the financial instrument; ie\nbased on emerging indicators of changes in the credit risk of the financial instrument, the entity\u2019s\ncredit risk management practice is expected to become more active or to be focused on managing\nthe instrument, including the instrument becoming more closely monitored or controlled, or the\nentity specifically intervening with the borrower.  \n(p) past due information, including the rebuttable presumption as set out in paragraph 5.5.11.  \nB5.5.18 In some cases, the qualitative and non-statistical quantitative information available may be sufficient to  \ndetermine that a financial instrument has met the criterion for the recognition of a loss allowance at an  \n-----  amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. That is, the information does not need to flow through a\nstatistical model or credit ratings process in order to determine whether there has been a significant increase\nin the credit risk of the financial instrument. In other cases, an entity may need to consider other\ninformation, including information from its statistical models or credit ratings processes. Alternatively, the\nentity may base the assessment on both types of information, ie qualitative factors that are not captured\nthrough the internal ratings process and a specific internal rating category at the reporting date, taking into\nconsideration the credit risk characteristics at initial recognition, if both types of information are relevant.  \n**_More than 30 days past due rebuttable presumption_**  \nB5.5.19 The rebuttable presumption in paragraph 5.5.11 is not an absolute indicator that lifetime expected credit  \nlosses should be recognised, but is presumed to be the latest point at which lifetime expected credit losses\nshould be recognised even when using forward-looking information (including macroeconomic factors on a\nportfolio level).  \nB5.5.20 An entity can rebut this presumption. However, it can do so only when it has reasonable and supportable  \ninformation available that demonstrates that even if contractual payments become more than 30 days past\ndue, this does not represent a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial instrument. For example\nwhen non-payment was an administrative oversight, instead of resulting from financial difficulty of the\nborrower, or the entity has access to historical evidence that demonstrates that there is no correlation\nbetween significant increases in the risk of a default occurring and financial assets on which payments are\nmore than 30 days past due, but that evidence does identify such a correlation when payments are more than\n60 days past due.  \nB5.5.21 An entity cannot align the timing of significant increases in credit risk and the recognition of lifetime  \nexpected credit losses to when a financial asset is regarded as credit-impaired or an entity\u2019s internal\ndefinition of default.  \n**_Financial instruments that have low credit risk at the reporting date_**  \nB5.5.22 The credit risk on a financial instrument is considered low for the purposes of paragraph 5.5.10, if the  \nfinancial instrument has a low risk of default, the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash\nflow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer\nterm may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow\nobligations. Financial instruments are not considered to have low credit risk when they are regarded as\nhaving a low risk of loss simply because of the value of collateral and the financial instrument without that\ncollateral would not be considered low credit risk. Financial instruments are also not considered to have low\ncredit risk simply because they have a lower risk of default than the entity\u2019s other financial instruments or\nrelative to the credit risk of the jurisdiction within which an entity operates.  \nB5.5.23 To determine whether a financial instrument has low credit risk, an entity may use its internal credit risk  \nratings or other methodologies that are consistent with a globally understood definition of low credit risk\nand that consider the risks and the type of financial instruments that are being assessed. An external rating\nof \u2018investment grade\u2019 is an example of a financial instrument that may be considered as having low credit\nrisk. However, financial instruments are not required to be externally rated to be considered to have low\ncredit risk. They should, however, be considered to have low credit risk from a market participant\nperspective taking into account all of the terms and conditions of the financial instrument.  \nB5.5.24 Lifetime expected credit losses are not recognised on a financial instrument simply because it was  \nconsidered to have low credit risk in the previous reporting period and is not considered to have low credit\nrisk at the reporting date. In such a case, an entity shall determine whether there has been a significant\nincrease in credit risk since initial recognition and thus whether lifetime expected credit losses are required\nto be recognised in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3.",

When the\nmodification of a financial asset results in the derecognition of the existing financial asset and the\nsubsequent recognition of the modified financial asset, the modified asset is considered a \u2018new\u2019 financial\nasset for the purposes of this Standard.  \nB5.5.26 Accordingly the date of the modification shall be treated as the date of initial recognition of that financial  \nasset when applying the impairment requirements to the modified financial asset. This typically means\nmeasuring the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses until the requirements\nfor the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses in paragraph 5.5.3 are met. However, in some unusual  \n-----  circumstances following a modification that results in derecognition of the original financial asset, there\nmay be evidence that the modified financial asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition, and thus, the\nfinancial asset should be recognised as an originated credit-impaired financial asset. This might occur, for\nexample, in a situation in which there was a substantial modification of a distressed asset that resulted in the\nderecognition of the original financial asset. In such a case, it may be possible for the modification to result\nin a new financial asset which is credit-impaired at initial recognition.  \nB5.5.27 If the contractual cash flows on a financial asset have been renegotiated or otherwise modified, but the  \nfinancial asset is not derecognised, that financial asset is not automatically considered to have lower credit\nrisk. An entity shall assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial\nrecognition on the basis of all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost\nor effort. This includes historical and forward-looking information and an assessment of the credit risk over\nthe expected life of the financial asset, which includes information about the circumstances that led to the\nmodification. Evidence that the criteria for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses are no longer\nmet may include a history of up-to-date and timely payment performance against the modified contractual\nterms. Typically a customer would need to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period\nof time before the credit risk is considered to have decreased.

A cash shortfall is the difference between the\ncash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects\nto receive. Because expected credit losses consider the amount and timing of payments, a credit loss arises\neven if the entity expects to be paid in full but later than when contractually due.  \nB5.5.29 For financial assets, a credit loss is the present value of the difference between:  \n(a) the contractual cash flows that are due to an entity under the contract; and  \n(b) the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.  \nB5.5.30 For undrawn loan commitments, a credit loss is the present value of the difference between:  \n(a) the contractual cash flows that are due to the entity if the holder of the loan commitment draws\ndown the loan; and  \n(b) the cash flows that the entity expects to receive if the loan is drawn down.  \nB5.5.31 An entity\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses on loan commitments shall be consistent with its expectations  \nof drawdowns on that loan commitment, ie it shall consider the expected portion of the loan commitment\nthat will be drawn down within 12 months of the reporting date when estimating 12-month expected credit\nlosses, and the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over the expected life of\nthe loan commitment when estimating lifetime expected credit losses.  \nB5.5.32 For a financial guarantee contract, the entity is required to make payments only in the event of a default by  \nthe debtor in accordance with the terms of the instrument that is guaranteed. Accordingly, cash shortfalls are\nthe expected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs less any amounts that the entity\nexpects to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party. If the asset is fully guaranteed, the\nestimation of cash shortfalls for a financial guarantee contract would be consistent with the estimations of\ncash shortfalls for the asset subject to the guarantee.  \nB5.5.33 For a financial asset that is credit-impaired at the reporting date, but that is not a purchased or originated  \ncredit-impaired financial asset, an entity shall measure the expected credit losses as the difference between\nthe asset\u2019s gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the\nfinancial asset\u2019s original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an\nimpairment gain or loss.  \nB5.5.34 When measuring a loss allowance for a lease receivable, the cash flows used for determining the expected  \ncredit losses should be consistent with the cash flows used in measuring the lease receivable in accordance\nwith AASB 16 Leases.  \nB5.5.35 An entity may use practical expedients when measuring expected credit losses if they are consistent with the  \nprinciples in paragraph 5.5.17. An example of a practical expedient is the calculation of the expected credit\nlosses on trade receivables using a provision matrix. The entity would use its historical credit loss\nexperience (adjusted as appropriate in accordance with paragraphs B5.5.51\u2013B5.5.52) for trade receivables  \n-----  to estimate the 12-month expected credit losses or the lifetime expected credit losses on the financial assets\nas relevant. A provision matrix might, for example, specify fixed provision rates depending on the number\nof days that a trade receivable is past due (for example, 1 per cent if not past due, 2 per cent if less than 30\ndays past due, 3 per cent if more than 30 days but less than 90 days past due, 20 per cent if 90\u2013180 days\npast due etc). Depending on the diversity of its customer base, the entity would use appropriate groupings if\nits historical credit loss experience shows significantly different loss patterns for different customer\nsegments. Examples of criteria that might be used to group assets include geographical region, product type,\ncustomer rating, collateral or trade credit insurance and type of customer (such as wholesale or retail).",

An accounting mismatch would be created or\nenlarged if presenting the effects of changes in the liability\u2019s credit risk in other comprehensive income\nwould result in a greater mismatch in profit or loss than if those amounts were presented in profit or loss.  \nB5.7.6 To make that determination, an entity must assess whether it expects that the effects of changes in the\nliability\u2019s credit risk will be offset in profit or loss by a change in the fair value of another financial\ninstrument measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such an expectation must be based on an economic  \n-----  relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial\ninstrument.  \nB5.7.7 That determination is made at initial recognition and is not reassessed. For practical purposes the entity\nneed not enter into all of the assets and liabilities giving rise to an accounting mismatch at exactly the same\ntime. A reasonable delay is permitted provided that any remaining transactions are expected to occur. An\nentity must apply consistently its methodology for determining whether presenting in other comprehensive\nincome the effects of changes in the liability\u2019s credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch\nin profit or loss. However, an entity may use different methodologies when there are different economic\nrelationships between the characteristics of the liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss\nand the characteristics of the other financial instruments. AASB 7 requires an entity to provide qualitative\ndisclosures in the notes to the financial statements about its methodology for making that determination.  \nB5.7.8 If such a mismatch would be created or enlarged, the entity is required to present all changes in fair value\n(including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) in profit or loss. If such a mismatch would\nnot be created or enlarged, the entity is required to present the effects of changes in the liability\u2019s credit risk\nin other comprehensive income.  \nB5.7.9 Amounts presented in other comprehensive income shall not be subsequently transferred to profit or loss.\nHowever, the entity may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.  \nB5.7.10 The following example describes a situation in which an accounting mismatch would be created in profit or  \nloss if the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability were presented in other comprehensive\nincome. A mortgage bank provides loans to customers and funds those loans by selling bonds with\nmatching characteristics (eg amount outstanding, repayment profile, term and currency) in the market. The\ncontractual terms of the loan permit the mortgage customer to prepay its loan (ie satisfy its obligation to the\nbank) by buying the corresponding bond at fair value in the market and delivering that bond to the mortgage\nbank. As a result of that contractual prepayment right, if the credit quality of the bond worsens (and, thus,\nthe fair value of the mortgage bank\u2019s liability decreases), the fair value of the mortgage bank\u2019s loan asset\nalso decreases. The change in the fair value of the asset reflects the mortgage customer\u2019s contractual right to\nprepay the mortgage loan by buying the underlying bond at fair value (which, in this example, has\ndecreased) and delivering the bond to the mortgage bank. Consequently, the effects of changes in the credit\nrisk of the liability (the bond) will be offset in profit or loss by a corresponding change in the fair value of a\nfinancial asset (the loan). If the effects of changes in the liability\u2019s credit risk were presented in other\ncomprehensive income there would be an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Consequently, the\nmortgage bank is required to present all changes in fair value of the liability (including the effects of\nchanges in the liability\u2019s credit risk) in profit or loss.  \nB5.7.11 In the example in paragraph B5.7.10, there is a contractual linkage between the effects of changes in the  \ncredit risk of the liability and changes in the fair value of the financial asset (ie as a result of the mortgage\ncustomer\u2019s contractual right to prepay the loan by buying the bond at fair value and delivering the bond to\nthe mortgage bank). However, an accounting mismatch may also occur in the absence of a contractual\nlinkage.  \nB5.7.12 For the purposes of applying the requirements in paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8, an accounting mismatch is not  \ncaused solely by the measurement method that an entity uses to determine the effects of changes in a\nliability\u2019s credit risk. An accounting mismatch in profit or loss would arise only when the effects of changes\nin the liability\u2019s credit risk (as defined in AASB 7) are expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of\nanother financial instrument. A mismatch that arises solely as a result of the measurement method (ie\nbecause an entity does not isolate changes in a liability\u2019s credit risk from some other changes in its fair\nvalue) does not affect the determination required by paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8. For example, an entity may\nnot isolate changes in a liability\u2019s credit risk from changes in liquidity risk. If the entity presents the\ncombined effect of both factors in other comprehensive income, a mismatch may occur because changes in\nliquidity risk may be included in the fair value measurement of the entity\u2019s financial assets and the entire\nfair value change of those assets is presented in profit or loss. However, such a mismatch is caused by\nmeasurement imprecision, not the offsetting relationship described in paragraph B5.7.6 and, therefore, does\nnot affect the determination required by paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8.  \n**_The meaning of \u2018credit risk\u2019 (paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8)_**  \nB5.7.13 AASB 7 defines credit risk as \u2018the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for  \nthe other party by failing to discharge an obligation\u2019. The requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a) relates to the\nrisk that the issuer will fail to perform on that particular liability. It does not necessarily relate to the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer. For example, if an entity issues a collateralised liability and a noncollateralised liability that are otherwise identical, the credit risk of those two liabilities will be different,\neven though they are issued by the same entity. The credit risk on the collateralised liability will be less than  \n-----  the credit risk of the non-collateralised liability. The credit risk for a collateralised liability may be close to\nzero.  \nB5.7.14 For the purposes of applying the requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a), credit risk is different from asset\nspecific performance risk. Asset-specific performance risk is not related to the risk that an entity will fail to\ndischarge a particular obligation but instead it is related to the risk that a single asset or a group of assets\nwill perform poorly (or not at all).  \nB5.7.15 The following are examples of asset-specific performance risk:  \n(a) a liability with a unit-linking feature whereby the amount due to investors is contractually\ndetermined on the basis of the performance of specified assets. The effect of that unit-linking\nfeature on the fair value of the liability is asset-specific performance risk, not credit risk.  \n(b) a liability issued by a structured entity with the following characteristics. The entity is legally\nisolated so the assets in the entity are ring-fenced solely for the benefit of its investors, even in the\nevent of bankruptcy. The entity enters into no other transactions and the assets in the entity\ncannot be hypothecated. Amounts are due to the entity\u2019s investors only if the ring-fenced assets\ngenerate cash flows. Thus, changes in the fair value of the liability primarily reflect changes in\nthe fair value of the assets. The effect of the performance of the assets on the fair value of the\nliability is asset-specific performance risk, not credit risk.  \n**_Determining the effects of changes in credit risk_**  \nB5.7.16 For the purposes of applying the requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a), an entity shall determine the amount of  \nchange in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that\nliability either:  \n(a) as the amount of change in its fair value that is not attributable to changes in market conditions\nthat give rise to market risk (see paragraphs B5.7.17 and B5.7.18); or  \n(b) using an alternative method the entity believes more faithfully represents the amount of change in\nthe liability\u2019s fair value that is attributable to changes in its credit risk.  \nB5.7.17 Changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk include changes in a benchmark interest rate, the  \nprice of another entity\u2019s financial instrument, a commodity price, a foreign exchange rate or an index of\nprices or rates.  \nB5.7.18 If the only significant relevant changes in market conditions for a liability are changes in an observed  \n(benchmark) interest rate, the amount in paragraph B5.7.16(a) can be estimated as follows:  \n(a) First, the entity computes the liability\u2019s internal rate of return at the start of the period using the\nfair value of the liability and the liability\u2019s contractual cash flows at the start of the period. It\ndeducts from this rate of return the observed (benchmark) interest rate at the start of the period, to\narrive at an instrument-specific component of the internal rate of return.  \n(b) Next, the entity calculates the present value of the cash flows associated with the liability using\nthe liability\u2019s contractual cash flows at the end of the period and a discount rate equal to the sum\nof (i) the observed (benchmark) interest rate at the end of the period and (ii) the instrumentspecific component of the internal rate of return as determined in (a).  \n(c) The difference between the fair value of the liability at the end of the period and the amount\ndetermined in (b) is the change in fair value that is not attributable to changes in the observed\n(benchmark) interest rate. This is the amount to be presented in other comprehensive income in\naccordance with paragraph 5.7.7(a).  \nB5.7.19 The example in paragraph B5.7.18 assumes that changes in fair value arising from factors other than  \nchanges in the instrument\u2019s credit risk or changes in observed (benchmark) interest rates are not significant.\nThis method would not be appropriate if changes in fair value arising from other factors are significant. In\nthose cases, an entity is required to use an alternative method that more faithfully measures the effects of\nchanges in the liability\u2019s credit risk (see paragraph B5.7.16(b)). For example, if the instrument in the\nexample contains an embedded derivative, the change in fair value of the embedded derivative is excluded\nin determining the amount to be presented in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph\n5.7.7(a).  \nB5.7.20 As with all fair value measurements, an entity\u2019s measurement method for determining the portion of the  \nchange in the liability\u2019s fair value that is attributable to changes in its credit risk must make maximum use\nof relevant observable inputs and minimum use of unobservable inputs.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Hedged items (Section 6.3)  \n### Qualifying items\nB6.3.1 A firm commitment to acquire a business in a business combination cannot be a hedged item, except for\nforeign currency risk, because the other risks being hedged cannot be specifically identified and measured.\nThose other risks are general business risks.  \nB6.3.2 An equity method investment cannot be a hedged item in a fair value hedge. This is because the equity\nmethod recognises in profit or loss the investor\u2019s share of the investee\u2019s profit or loss, instead of changes in\nthe investment\u2019s fair value. For a similar reason, an investment in a consolidated subsidiary cannot be a\nhedged item in a fair value hedge. This is because consolidation recognises in profit or loss the subsidiary\u2019s\nprofit or loss, instead of changes in the investment\u2019s fair value. A hedge of a net investment in a foreign\noperation is different because it is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure, not a fair value hedge of the\nchange in the value of the investment.  \nB6.3.3 Paragraph 6.3.4 permits an entity to designate as hedged items aggregated exposures that are a combination\nof an exposure and a derivative. When designating such a hedged item, an entity assesses whether the\naggregated exposure combines an exposure with a derivative so that it creates a different aggregated\nexposure that is managed as one exposure for a particular risk (or risks). In that case, the entity may\ndesignate the hedged item on the basis of the aggregated exposure. For example:  \n(a) an entity may hedge a given quantity of highly probable coffee purchases in 15 months\u2019 time\nagainst price risk (based on US dollars) using a 15-month futures contract for coffee. The highly\nprobable coffee purchases and the futures contract for coffee in combination can be viewed as a\n15-month fixed-amount US dollar foreign currency risk exposure for risk management purposes\n(ie like any fixed-amount US dollar cash outflow in 15 months\u2019 time).  \n(b) an entity may hedge the foreign currency risk for the entire term of a 10-year fixed-rate debt\ndenominated in a foreign currency. However, the entity requires fixed-rate exposure in its\nfunctional currency only for a short to medium term (say two years) and floating rate exposure in\nits functional currency for the remaining term to maturity. At the end of each of the two-year\nintervals (ie on a two-year rolling basis) the entity fixes the next two years\u2019 interest rate exposure\n(if the interest level is such that the entity wants to fix interest rates). In such a situation an entity  \n-----  may enter into a 10-year fixed-to-floating cross-currency interest rate swap that swaps the fixedrate foreign currency debt into a variable-rate functional currency exposure. This is overlaid with\na two-year interest rate swap that \u2013 on the basis of the functional currency \u2013 swaps variable-rate\ndebt into fixed-rate debt. In effect, the fixed-rate foreign currency debt and the 10-year fixed-tofloating cross-currency interest rate swap in combination are viewed as a 10-year variable-rate\ndebt functional currency exposure for risk management purposes.  \nB6.3.4 When designating the hedged item on the basis of the aggregated exposure, an entity considers the\ncombined effect of the items that constitute the aggregated exposure for the purpose of assessing hedge\neffectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness. However, the items that constitute the aggregated\nexposure remain accounted for separately. This means that, for example:  \n(a) derivatives that are part of an aggregated exposure are recognised as separate assets or liabilities\nmeasured at fair value; and  \n(b) if a hedging relationship is designated between the items that constitute the aggregated exposure,\nthe way in which a derivative is included as part of an aggregated exposure must be consistent\nwith the designation of that derivative as the hedging instrument at the level of the aggregated\nexposure. For example, if an entity excludes the forward element of a derivative from its\ndesignation as the hedging instrument for the hedging relationship between the items that\nconstitute the aggregated exposure, it must also exclude the forward element when including that\nderivative as a hedged item as part of the aggregated exposure. Otherwise, the aggregated\nexposure shall include a derivative, either in its entirety or a proportion of it.  \nB6.3.5 Paragraph 6.3.6 states that in consolidated financial statements the foreign currency risk of a highly\nprobable forecast intragroup transaction may qualify as a hedged item in a cash flow hedge, provided that\nthe transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity entering into\nthat transaction and that the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit or loss. For this purpose an\nentity can be a parent, subsidiary, associate, joint arrangement or branch. If the foreign currency risk of a\nforecast intragroup transaction does not affect consolidated profit or loss, the intragroup transaction cannot\nqualify as a hedged item. This is usually the case for royalty payments, interest payments or management\ncharges between members of the same group, unless there is a related external transaction. However, when\nthe foreign currency risk of a forecast intragroup transaction will affect consolidated profit or loss, the\nintragroup transaction can qualify as a hedged item. An example is forecast sales or purchases of\ninventories between members of the same group if there is an onward sale of the inventory to a party\nexternal to the group. Similarly, a forecast intragroup sale of plant and equipment from the group entity that\nmanufactured it to a group entity that will use the plant and equipment in its operations may affect\nconsolidated profit or loss. This could occur, for example, because the plant and equipment will be\ndepreciated by the purchasing entity and the amount initially recognised for the plant and equipment may\nchange if the forecast intragroup transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency\nof the purchasing entity.  \nB6.3.6 If a hedge of a forecast intragroup transaction qualifies for hedge accounting, any gain or loss is recognised\nin, and taken out of, other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11. The relevant period\nor periods during which the foreign currency risk of the hedged transaction affects profit or loss is when it\naffects consolidated profit or loss.",

        "page_content=": "### Designation of hedged items\nB6.3.7 A component is a hedged item that is less than the entire item. Consequently, a component reflects only\nsome of the risks of the item of which it is a part or reflects the risks only to some extent (for example,\nwhen designating a proportion of an item).  \n**_Risk components_**  \nB6.3.8 To be eligible for designation as a hedged item, a risk component must be a separately identifiable\ncomponent of the financial or the non-financial item, and the changes in the cash flows or the fair value of\nthe item attributable to changes in that risk component must be reliably measurable.  \nB6.3.9 When identifying what risk components qualify for designation as a hedged item, an entity assesses such\nrisk components within the context of the particular market structure to which the risk or risks relate and in\nwhich the hedging activity takes place. Such a determination requires an evaluation of the relevant facts and\ncircumstances, which differ by risk and market.  \nB6.3.10 When designating risk components as hedged items, an entity considers whether the risk components are  \nexplicitly specified in a contract (contractually specified risk components) or whether they are implicit in\nthe fair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (non-contractually specified risk  \n-----  components). Non-contractually specified risk components can relate to items that are not a contract (for\nexample, forecast transactions) or contracts that do not explicitly specify the component (for example, a\nfirm commitment that includes only one single price instead of a pricing formula that references different\nunderlyings). For example:  \n(a) Entity A has a long-term supply contract for natural gas that is priced using a contractually\nspecified formula that references commodities and other factors (for example, gas oil, fuel oil and\nother components such as transport charges). Entity A hedges the gas oil component in that\nsupply contract using a gas oil forward contract. Because the gas oil component is specified by\nthe terms and conditions of the supply contract it is a contractually specified risk component.\nHence, because of the pricing formula, Entity A concludes that the gas oil price exposure is\nseparately identifiable. At the same time, there is a market for gas oil forward contracts. Hence,\nEntity A concludes that the gas oil price exposure is reliably measurable. Consequently, the gas\noil price exposure in the supply contract is a risk component that is eligible for designation as a\nhedged item.  \n(b) Entity B hedges its future coffee purchases based on its production forecast. Hedging starts up to\n15 months before delivery for part of the forecast purchase volume. Entity B increases the hedged\nvolume over time (as the delivery date approaches). Entity B uses two different types of contracts\nto manage its coffee price risk:  \n(i) exchange-traded coffee futures contracts; and  \n(ii) coffee supply contracts for Arabica coffee from Colombia delivered to a specific\nmanufacturing site. These contracts price a tonne of coffee based on the exchangetraded coffee futures contract price plus a fixed price differential plus a variable\nlogistics services charge using a pricing formula. The coffee supply contract is an\nexecutory contract in accordance with which Entity B takes actual delivery of coffee.  \nFor deliveries that relate to the current harvest, entering into the coffee supply contracts allows\nEntity B to fix the price differential between the actual coffee quality purchased (Arabica coffee\nfrom Colombia) and the benchmark quality that is the underlying of the exchange-traded futures\ncontract. However, for deliveries that relate to the next harvest, the coffee supply contracts are not\nyet available, so the price differential cannot be fixed. Entity B uses exchange-traded coffee\nfutures contracts to hedge the benchmark quality component of its coffee price risk for deliveries\nthat relate to the current harvest as well as the next harvest. Entity B determines that it is exposed\nto three different risks: coffee price risk reflecting the benchmark quality, coffee price risk\nreflecting the difference (spread) between the price for the benchmark quality coffee and the\nparticular Arabica coffee from Colombia that it actually receives, and the variable logistics costs.\nFor deliveries related to the current harvest, after Entity B enters into a coffee supply contract, the\ncoffee price risk reflecting the benchmark quality is a contractually specified risk component\nbecause the pricing formula includes an indexation to the exchange-traded coffee futures contract\nprice. Entity B concludes that this risk component is separately identifiable and reliably\nmeasurable. For deliveries related to the next harvest, Entity B has not yet entered into any coffee\nsupply contracts (ie those deliveries are forecast transactions). Hence, the coffee price risk\nreflecting the benchmark quality is a non-contractually specified risk component. Entity B\u2019s\nanalysis of the market structure takes into account how eventual deliveries of the particular coffee\nthat it receives are priced. Hence, on the basis of this analysis of the market structure, Entity B\nconcludes that the forecast transactions also involve the coffee price risk that reflects the\nbenchmark quality as a risk component that is separately identifiable and reliably measurable\neven though it is not contractually specified. Consequently, Entity B may designate hedging\nrelationships on a risk components basis (for the coffee price risk that reflects the benchmark\nquality) for coffee supply contracts as well as forecast transactions.  \n(c) Entity C hedges part of its future jet fuel purchases on the basis of its consumption forecast up to\n24 months before delivery and increases the volume that it hedges over time. Entity C hedges this\nexposure using different types of contracts depending on the time horizon of the hedge, which\naffects the market liquidity of the derivatives. For the longer time horizons (12\u201324 months) Entity\nC uses crude oil contracts because only these have sufficient market liquidity. For time horizons\nof 6\u201312 months Entity C uses gas oil derivatives because they are sufficiently liquid. For time\nhorizons up to six months Entity C uses jet fuel contracts. Entity C\u2019s analysis of the market\nstructure for oil and oil products and its evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances is as\nfollows:  \n(i) Entity C operates in a geographical area in which Brent is the crude oil benchmark.\nCrude oil is a raw material benchmark that affects the price of various refined oil\nproducts as their most basic input. Gas oil is a benchmark for refined oil products,  \n-----  which is used as a pricing reference for oil distillates more generally. This is also\nreflected in the types of derivative financial instruments for the crude oil and refined oil\nproducts markets of the environment in which Entity C operates, such as:  \nthe benchmark crude oil futures contract, which is for Brent crude oil;  \nthe benchmark gas oil futures contract, which is used as the pricing reference for\ndistillates \u2013 for example, jet fuel spread derivatives cover the price differential\nbetween jet fuel and that benchmark gas oil; and  \nthe benchmark gas oil crack spread derivative (ie the derivative for the price\ndifferential between crude oil and gas oil \u2013 a refining margin), which is indexed to\nBrent crude oil.  \n(ii) the pricing of refined oil products does not depend on which particular crude oil is\nprocessed by a particular refinery because those refined oil products (such as gas oil or\njet fuel) are standardised products.  \nHence, Entity C concludes that the price risk of its jet fuel purchases includes a crude oil price\nrisk component based on Brent crude oil and a gas oil price risk component, even though crude\noil and gas oil are not specified in any contractual arrangement. Entity C concludes that these two\nrisk components are separately identifiable and reliably measurable even though they are not\ncontractually specified. Consequently, Entity C may designate hedging relationships for forecast\njet fuel purchases on a risk components basis (for crude oil or gas oil). This analysis also means\nthat if, for example, Entity C used crude oil derivatives based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\ncrude oil, changes in the price differential between Brent crude oil and WTI crude oil would\ncause hedge ineffectiveness.  \n(d) Entity D holds a fixed-rate debt instrument. This instrument is issued in an environment with a\nmarket in which a large variety of similar debt instruments are compared by their spreads to a\nbenchmark rate (for example, LIBOR) and variable-rate instruments in that environment are\ntypically indexed to that benchmark rate. Interest rate swaps are frequently used to manage\ninterest rate risk on the basis of that benchmark rate, irrespective of the spread of debt instruments\nto that benchmark rate. The price of fixed-rate debt instruments varies directly in response to\nchanges in the benchmark rate as they happen. Entity D concludes that the benchmark rate is a\ncomponent that can be separately identified and reliably measured. Consequently, Entity D may\ndesignate hedging relationships for the fixed-rate debt instrument on a risk component basis for\nthe benchmark interest rate risk.  \nB6.3.11 When designating a risk component as a hedged item, the hedge accounting requirements apply to that risk  \ncomponent in the same way as they apply to other hedged items that are not risk components. For example,\nthe qualifying criteria apply, including that the hedging relationship must meet the hedge effectiveness\nrequirements, and any hedge ineffectiveness must be measured and recognised.  \nB6.3.12 An entity can also designate only changes in the cash flows or fair value of a hedged item above or below a  \nspecified price or other variable (a \u2018one-sided risk\u2019). The intrinsic value of a purchased option hedging\ninstrument (assuming that it has the same principal terms as the designated risk), but not its time value,\nreflects a one-sided risk in a hedged item. For example, an entity can designate the variability of future cash\nflow outcomes resulting from a price increase of a forecast commodity purchase. In such a situation, the\nentity designates only cash flow losses that result from an increase in the price above the specified level.\nThe hedged risk does not include the time value of a purchased option, because the time value is not a\ncomponent of the forecast transaction that affects profit or loss.  \nB6.3.13 There is a rebuttable presumption that unless inflation risk is contractually specified, it is not separately  \nidentifiable and reliably measurable and hence cannot be designated as a risk component of a financial\ninstrument. However, in limited cases, it is possible to identify a risk component for inflation risk that is\nseparately identifiable and reliably measurable because of the particular circumstances of the inflation\nenvironment and the relevant debt market.  \nB6.3.14 For example, an entity issues debt in an environment in which inflation-linked bonds have a volume and  \nterm structure that results in a sufficiently liquid market that allows constructing a term structure of zerocoupon real interest rates. This means that for the respective currency, inflation is a relevant factor that is\nseparately considered by the debt markets. In those circumstances the inflation risk component could be\ndetermined by discounting the cash flows of the hedged debt instrument using the term structure of zerocoupon real interest rates (ie in a manner similar to how a risk-free (nominal) interest rate component can be\ndetermined). Conversely, in many cases an inflation risk component is not separately identifiable and\nreliably measurable. For example, an entity issues only nominal interest rate debt in an environment with a\nmarket for inflation-linked bonds that is not sufficiently liquid to allow a term structure of zero-coupon real\ninterest rates to be constructed. In this case the analysis of the market structure and of the facts and  \n-----  circumstances does not support the entity concluding that inflation is a relevant factor that is separately\nconsidered by the debt markets. Hence, the entity cannot overcome the rebuttable presumption that inflation\nrisk that is not contractually specified is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable. Consequently,\nan inflation risk component would not be eligible for designation as the hedged item. This applies\nirrespective of any inflation hedging instrument that the entity has actually entered into. In particular, the\nentity cannot simply impute the terms and conditions of the actual inflation hedging instrument by\nprojecting its terms and conditions onto the nominal interest rate debt.  \nB6.3.15 A contractually specified inflation risk component of the cash flows of a recognised inflation-linked bond  \n(assuming that there is no requirement to account for an embedded derivative separately) is separately\nidentifiable and reliably measurable, as long as other cash flows of the instrument are not affected by the\ninflation risk component.  \n**_Components of a nominal amount_**  \nB6.3.16 There are two types of components of nominal amounts that can be designated as the hedged item in a  \nhedging relationship: a component that is a proportion of an entire item or a layer component. The type of\ncomponent changes the accounting outcome. An entity shall designate the component for accounting\npurposes consistently with its risk management objective.  \nB6.3.17 An example of a component that is a proportion is 50 per cent of the contractual cash flows of a loan.  \nB6.3.18 A layer component may be specified from a defined, but open, population, or from a defined nominal  \namount. Examples include:  \n(a) part of a monetary transaction volume, for example, the next FC10 cash flows from sales\ndenominated in a foreign currency after the first FC20 in March 201X;[6]  \n(b) a part of a physical volume, for example, the bottom layer, measuring 5 million cubic metres, of\nthe natural gas stored in location XYZ;  \n(c) a part of a physical or other transaction volume, for example, the first 100 barrels of the oil\npurchases in June 201X or the first 100 MWh of electricity sales in June 201X; or  \n(d) a layer from the nominal amount of the hedged item, for example, the last CU80 million of a\nCU100 million firm commitment, the bottom layer of CU20 million of a CU100 million fixedrate bond or the top layer of CU30 million from a total amount of CU100 million of fixed-rate\ndebt that can be prepaid at fair value (the defined nominal amount is CU100 million).  \nB6.3.19 If a layer component is designated in a fair value hedge, an entity shall specify it from a defined nominal  \namount. To comply with the requirements for qualifying fair value hedges, an entity shall remeasure the\nhedged item for fair value changes (ie remeasure the item for fair value changes attributable to the hedged\nrisk). The fair value hedge adjustment must be recognised in profit or loss no later than when the item is\nderecognised. Consequently, it is necessary to track the item to which the fair value hedge adjustment\nrelates. For a layer component in a fair value hedge, this requires an entity to track the nominal amount\nfrom which it is defined. For example, in paragraph B6.3.18(d), the total defined nominal amount of CU100\nmillion must be tracked in order to track the bottom layer of CU20 million or the top layer of CU30 million.  \nB6.3.20 A layer component that includes a prepayment option is not eligible to be designated as a hedged item in a  \nfair value hedge if the prepayment option\u2019s fair value is affected by changes in the hedged risk, unless the\ndesignated layer includes the effect of the related prepayment option when determining the change in the\nfair value of the hedged item.  \n**_Relationship between components and the total cash flows of an item_**  \nB6.3.21 If a component of the cash flows of a financial or a non-financial item is designated as the hedged item, that  \ncomponent must be less than or equal to the total cash flows of the entire item. However, all of the cash\nflows of the entire item may be designated as the hedged item and hedged for only one particular risk (for\nexample, only for those changes that are attributable to changes in LIBOR or a benchmark commodity\nprice).  \nB6.3.22 For example, in the case of a financial liability whose effective interest rate is below LIBOR, an entity  \ncannot designate:  \n(a) a component of the liability equal to interest at LIBOR (plus the principal amount in case of a fair\nvalue hedge); and  \n6 In this Standard monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units\u2019 (CU) and \u2018foreign currency units\u2019 (FC).  \n-----  (b) a negative residual component.  \nB6.3.23 However, in the case of a fixed-rate financial liability whose effective interest rate is (for example) 100  \nbasis points below LIBOR, an entity can designate as the hedged item the change in the value of that entire\nliability (ie principal plus interest at LIBOR minus 100 basis points) that is attributable to changes in\nLIBOR. If a fixed-rate financial instrument is hedged some time after its origination and interest rates have\nchanged in the meantime, the entity can designate a risk component equal to a benchmark rate that is higher\nthan the contractual rate paid on the item. The entity can do so provided that the benchmark rate is less than\nthe effective interest rate calculated on the assumption that the entity had purchased the instrument on the\nday when it first designates the hedged item. For example, assume that an entity originates a fixed-rate\nfinancial asset of CU100 that has an effective interest rate of 6 per cent at a time when LIBOR is 4 per cent.\nIt begins to hedge that asset some time later when LIBOR has increased to 8 per cent and the fair value of\nthe asset has decreased to CU90. The entity calculates that if it had purchased the asset on the date it first\ndesignates the related LIBOR interest rate risk as the hedged item, the effective yield of the asset based on\nits then fair value of CU90 would have been 9.5 per cent. Because LIBOR is less than this effective yield,\nthe entity can designate a LIBOR component of 8 per cent that consists partly of the contractual interest\ncash flows and partly of the difference between the current fair value (ie CU90) and the amount repayable\non maturity (ie CU100).  \nB6.3.24 If a variable-rate financial liability bears interest of (for example) three-month LIBOR minus 20 basis  \npoints (with a floor at zero basis points), an entity can designate as the hedged item the change in the cash\nflows of that entire liability (ie three-month LIBOR minus 20 basis points \u2013 including the floor) that is\nattributable to changes in LIBOR. Hence, as long as the three-month LIBOR forward curve for the\nremaining life of that liability does not fall below 20 basis points, the hedged item has the same cash flow\nvariability as a liability that bears interest at three-month LIBOR with a zero or positive spread. However, if\nthe three-month LIBOR forward curve for the remaining life of that liability (or a part of it) falls below 20\nbasis points, the hedged item has a lower cash flow variability than a liability that bears interest at threemonth LIBOR with a zero or positive spread.  \nB6.3.25 A similar example of a non-financial item is a specific type of crude oil from a particular oil field that is  \npriced off the relevant benchmark crude oil. If an entity sells that crude oil under a contract using a\ncontractual pricing formula that sets the price per barrel at the benchmark crude oil price minus CU10 with\na floor of CU15, the entity can designate as the hedged item the entire cash flow variability under the sales\ncontract that is attributable to the change in the benchmark crude oil price. However, the entity cannot\ndesignate a component that is equal to the full change in the benchmark crude oil price. Hence, as long as\nthe forward price (for each delivery) does not fall below CU25, the hedged item has the same cash flow\nvariability as a crude oil sale at the benchmark crude oil price (or with a positive spread). However, if the\nforward price for any delivery falls below CU25, the hedged item has a lower cash flow variability than a\ncrude oil sale at the benchmark crude oil price (or with a positive spread).",

The effect of credit risk means that even if\nthere is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the level of offset\nmight become erratic. This can result from a change in the credit risk of either the hedging instrument or the\nhedged item that is of such a magnitude that the credit risk dominates the value changes that result from the\neconomic relationship (ie the effect of the changes in the underlyings). A level of magnitude that gives rise\nto dominance is one that would result in the loss (or gain) from credit risk frustrating the effect of changes\nin the underlyings on the value of the hedging instrument or the hedged item, even if those changes were\nsignificant. Conversely, if during a particular period there is little change in the underlyings, the fact that\neven small credit risk-related changes in the value of the hedging instrument or the hedged item might\naffect the value more than the underlyings does not create dominance.  \nB6.4.8 An example of credit risk dominating a hedging relationship is when an entity hedges an exposure to\ncommodity price risk using an uncollateralised derivative.

Similarly, if, for example, an entity hedges an exposure using a nominal amount of 40 units of a\nfinancial instrument, it shall designate the hedging relationship using a hedge ratio that is the same as that\nresulting from that quantity of 40 units (ie the entity must not use a hedge ratio based on a higher quantity\nof units that it might hold in total or a lower quantity of units) and the quantity of the hedged item that it\nactually hedges with those 40 units.  \nB6.4.10 However, the designation of the hedging relationship using the same hedge ratio as that resulting from the  \nquantities of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses shall not reflect an\nimbalance between the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would in turn create\nhedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome\nthat would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting. Hence, for the purpose of designating a\nhedging relationship, an entity must adjust the hedge ratio that results from the quantities of the hedged item\nand the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses if that is needed to avoid such an imbalance.  \nB6.4.11 Examples of relevant considerations in assessing whether an accounting outcome is inconsistent with the  \npurpose of hedge accounting are:  \n(a) whether the intended hedge ratio is established to avoid recognising hedge ineffectiveness for\ncash flow hedges, or to achieve fair value hedge adjustments for more hedged items with the aim\nof increasing the use of fair value accounting, but without offsetting fair value changes of the\nhedging instrument; and  \n-----  (b) whether there is a commercial reason for the particular weightings of the hedged item and the\nhedging instrument, even though that creates hedge ineffectiveness. For example, an entity enters\ninto and designates a quantity of the hedging instrument that is not the quantity that it determined\nas the best hedge of the hedged item because the standard volume of the hedging instruments\ndoes not allow it to enter into that exact quantity of hedging instrument (a \u2018lot size issue\u2019). An\nexample is an entity that hedges 100 tonnes of coffee purchases with standard coffee futures\ncontracts that have a contract size of 37,500 lbs (pounds). The entity could only use either five or\nsix contracts (equivalent to 85.0 and 102.1 tonnes respectively) to hedge the purchase volume of\n100 tonnes. In that case, the entity designates the hedging relationship using the hedge ratio that\nresults from the number of coffee futures contracts that it actually uses, because the hedge\nineffectiveness resulting from the mismatch in the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging\ninstrument would not result in an accounting outcome that is inconsistent with the purpose of\nhedge accounting.  \n**Frequency of assessing whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are**\n**met**  \nB6.4.12 An entity shall assess at the inception of the hedging relationship, and on an ongoing basis, whether a  \nhedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements. At a minimum, an entity shall perform the\nongoing assessment at each reporting date or upon a significant change in the circumstances affecting the\nhedge effectiveness requirements, whichever comes first.

However, an entity shall use a method that captures the relevant characteristics\nof the hedging relationship including the sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Depending on those factors, the\nmethod can be a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.  \nB6.4.14 For example, when the critical terms (such as the nominal amount, maturity and underlying) of the hedging  \ninstrument and the hedged item match or are closely aligned, it might be possible for an entity to conclude\non the basis of a qualitative assessment of those critical terms that the hedging instrument and the hedged\nitem have values that will generally move in the opposite direction because of the same risk and hence that\nan economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (see paragraphs\nB6.4.4\u2013B6.4.6).  \nB6.4.15 The fact that a derivative is in or out of the money when it is designated as a hedging instrument does not in  \nitself mean that a qualitative assessment is inappropriate. It depends on the circumstances whether hedge\nineffectiveness arising from that fact could have a magnitude that a qualitative assessment would not\nadequately capture.  \nB6.4.16 Conversely, if the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned, there  \nis an increased level of uncertainty about the extent of offset. Consequently, the hedge effectiveness during\nthe term of the hedging relationship is more difficult to predict. In such a situation it might only be possible\nfor an entity to conclude on the basis of a quantitative assessment that an economic relationship exists\nbetween the hedged item and the hedging instrument (see paragraphs B6.4.4\u2013B6.4.6). In some situations a\nquantitative assessment might also be needed to assess whether the hedge ratio used for designating the\nhedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (see paragraphs B6.4.9\u2013B6.4.11). An\nentity can use the same or different methods for those two different purposes.  \nB6.4.17 If there are changes in circumstances that affect hedge effectiveness, an entity may have to change the  \nmethod for assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements in order to\nensure that the relevant characteristics of the hedging relationship, including the sources of hedge\nineffectiveness, are still captured.  \nB6.4.18 An entity\u2019s risk management is the main source of information to perform the assessment of whether a  \nhedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements. This means that the management\ninformation (or analysis) used for decision-making purposes can be used as a basis for assessing whether a\nhedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.  \nB6.4.19 An entity\u2019s documentation of the hedging relationship includes how it will assess the hedge effectiveness  \nrequirements, including the method or methods used. The documentation of the hedging relationship shall\nbe updated for any changes to the methods (see paragraph B6.4.17).  \n-----  ",

Such a hedge could be entered into by the issuer or by the\nholder.  \nB6.5.2 The purpose of a cash flow hedge is to defer the gain or loss on the hedging instrument to a period or\nperiods in which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. An example of a cash flow\nhedge is the use of a swap to change floating rate debt (whether measured at amortised cost or fair value) to\nfixed-rate debt (ie a hedge of a future transaction in which the future cash flows being hedged are the future\ninterest payments).

Consequently, the\nentity determines the value of the hedged item on a present value basis and therefore the change in the value\nof the hedged item also includes the effect of the time value of money.  \nB6.5.5 To calculate the change in the value of the hedged item for the purpose of measuring hedge ineffectiveness,\nan entity may use a derivative that would have terms that match the critical terms of the hedged item (this is\ncommonly referred to as a \u2018hypothetical derivative\u2019), and, for example for a hedge of a forecast transaction,\nwould be calibrated using the hedged price (or rate) level. For example, if the hedge was for a two-sided\nrisk at the current market level, the hypothetical derivative would represent a hypothetical forward contract\nthat is calibrated to a value of nil at the time of designation of the hedging relationship. If the hedge was for\nexample for a one-sided risk, the hypothetical derivative would represent the intrinsic value of a\nhypothetical option that at the time of designation of the hedging relationship is at the money if the hedged\nprice level is the current market level, or out of the money if the hedged price level is above (or, for a hedge\nof a long position, below) the current market level. Using a hypothetical derivative is one possible way of\ncalculating the change in the value of the hedged item.

Consequently, a \u2018hypothetical\nderivative\u2019 cannot be used to include features in the value of the hedged item that only exist in the hedging\ninstrument (but not in the hedged item). An example is debt denominated in a foreign currency (irrespective\nof whether it is fixed-rate or variable-rate debt). When using a hypothetical derivative to calculate the\nchange in the value of such debt or the present value of the cumulative change in its cash flows, the\nhypothetical derivative cannot simply impute a charge for exchanging different currencies even though\nactual derivatives under which different currencies are exchanged might include such a charge (for\nexample, cross-currency interest rate swaps).  \nB6.5.6 The change in the value of the hedged item determined using a hypothetical derivative may also be used for\nthe purpose of assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.",

Changes to designated quantities of a hedged item or\nof a hedging instrument for a different purpose do not constitute rebalancing for the purpose of this\nStandard.  \nB6.5.8 Rebalancing is accounted for as a continuation of the hedging relationship in accordance with paragraphs\nB6.5.9\u2013B6.5.21. On rebalancing, the hedge ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship is determined and\nrecognised immediately before adjusting the hedging relationship.  \n-----  B6.5.9 Adjusting the hedge ratio allows an entity to respond to changes in the relationship between the hedging\ninstrument and the hedged item that arise from their underlyings or risk variables. For example, a hedging\nrelationship in which the hedging instrument and the hedged item have different but related underlyings\nchanges in response to a change in the relationship between those two underlyings (for example, different\nbut related reference indices, rates or prices). Hence, rebalancing allows the continuation of a hedging\nrelationship in situations in which the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item\nchanges in a way that can be compensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.  \nB6.5.10 For example, an entity hedges an exposure to Foreign Currency A using a currency derivative that  \nreferences Foreign Currency B and Foreign Currencies A and B are pegged (ie their exchange rate is\nmaintained within a band or at an exchange rate set by a central bank or other authority). If the exchange\nrate between Foreign Currency A and Foreign Currency B were changed (ie a new band or rate was set),\nrebalancing the hedging relationship to reflect the new exchange rate would ensure that the hedging\nrelationship would continue to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement for the hedge ratio in the new\ncircumstances. In contrast, if there was a default on the currency derivative, changing the hedge ratio could\nnot ensure that the hedging relationship would continue to meet that hedge effectiveness requirement.\nHence, rebalancing does not facilitate the continuation of a hedging relationship in situations in which the\nrelationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item changes in a way that cannot be\ncompensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.  \nB6.5.11 Not every change in the extent of offset between the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and  \nthe hedged item\u2019s fair value or cash flows constitutes a change in the relationship between the hedging\ninstrument and the hedged item. An entity analyses the sources of hedge ineffectiveness that it expected to\naffect the hedging relationship during its term and evaluates whether changes in the extent of offset are:  \n(a) fluctuations around the hedge ratio, which remains valid (ie continues to appropriately reflect the\nrelationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item); or  \n(b) an indication that the hedge ratio no longer appropriately reflects the relationship between the\nhedging instrument and the hedged item.  \nAn entity performs this evaluation against the hedge effectiveness requirement for the hedge ratio, ie to\nensure that the hedging relationship does not reflect an imbalance between the weightings of the hedged\nitem and the hedging instrument that would create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised\nor not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge\naccounting. Hence, this evaluation requires judgement.  \nB6.5.12 Fluctuation around a constant hedge ratio (and hence the related hedge ineffectiveness) cannot be reduced  \nby adjusting the hedge ratio in response to each particular outcome. Hence, in such circumstances, the\nchange in the extent of offset is a matter of measuring and recognising hedge ineffectiveness but does not\nrequire rebalancing.  \nB6.5.13 Conversely, if changes in the extent of offset indicate that the fluctuation is around a hedge ratio that is  \ndifferent from the hedge ratio that is currently used for that hedging relationship, or that there is a trend\nleading away from that hedge ratio, hedge ineffectiveness can be reduced by adjusting the hedge ratio,\nwhereas retaining the hedge ratio would increasingly produce hedge ineffectiveness. Hence, in such\ncircumstances, an entity must evaluate whether the hedging relationship reflects an imbalance between the\nweightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would create hedge ineffectiveness\n(irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be\ninconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting. If the hedge ratio is adjusted, it also affects the\nmeasurement and recognition of hedge ineffectiveness because, on rebalancing, the hedge ineffectiveness of\nthe hedging relationship must be determined and recognised immediately before adjusting the hedging\nrelationship in accordance with paragraph B6.5.8.  \nB6.5.14 Rebalancing means that, for hedge accounting purposes, after the start of a hedging relationship an entity  \nadjusts the quantities of the hedging instrument or the hedged item in response to changes in circumstances\nthat affect the hedge ratio of that hedging relationship. Typically, that adjustment should reflect adjustments\nin the quantities of the hedging instrument and the hedged item that it actually uses. However, an entity\nmust adjust the hedge ratio that results from the quantities of the hedged item or the hedging instrument that\nit actually uses if:  \n(a) the hedge ratio that results from changes to the quantities of the hedging instrument or the hedged\nitem that the entity actually uses would reflect an imbalance that would create hedge\nineffectiveness that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the\npurpose of hedge accounting; or  \n(b) an entity would retain quantities of the hedging instrument and the hedged item that it actually\nuses, resulting in a hedge ratio that, in new circumstances, would reflect an imbalance that would\ncreate hedge ineffectiveness that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent  \n-----  with the purpose of hedge accounting (ie an entity must not create an imbalance by omitting to\nadjust the hedge ratio).  \nB6.5.15 Rebalancing does not apply if the risk management objective for a hedging relationship has changed.  \nInstead, hedge accounting for that hedging relationship shall be discontinued (despite that an entity might\ndesignate a new hedging relationship that involves the hedging instrument or hedged item of the previous\nhedging relationship as described in paragraph B6.5.28).  \nB6.5.16 If a hedging relationship is rebalanced, the adjustment to the hedge ratio can be effected in different ways:  \n(a) the weighting of the hedged item can be increased (which at the same time reduces the weighting\nof the hedging instrument) by:  \n(i) increasing the volume of the hedged item; or  \n(ii) decreasing the volume of the hedging instrument.  \n(b) the weighting of the hedging instrument can be increased (which at the same time reduces the\nweighting of the hedged item) by:  \n(i) increasing the volume of the hedging instrument; or  \n(ii) decreasing the volume of the hedged item.  \nChanges in volume refer to the quantities that are part of the hedging relationship. Hence, decreases in\nvolumes do not necessarily mean that the items or transactions no longer exist, or are no longer expected to\noccur, but that they are not part of the hedging relationship. For example, decreasing the volume of the\nhedging instrument can result in the entity retaining a derivative, but only part of it might remain a hedging\ninstrument of the hedging relationship. This could occur if the rebalancing could be effected only by\nreducing the volume of the hedging instrument in the hedging relationship, but with the entity retaining the\nvolume that is no longer needed. In that case, the undesignated part of the derivative would be accounted for\nat fair value through profit or loss (unless it was designated as a hedging instrument in a different hedging\nrelationship).  \nB6.5.17 Adjusting the hedge ratio by increasing the volume of the hedged item does not affect how the changes in  \nthe fair value of the hedging instrument are measured. The measurement of the changes in the value of the\nhedged item related to the previously designated volume also remains unaffected. However, from the date\nof rebalancing, the changes in the value of the hedged item also include the change in the value of the\nadditional volume of the hedged item. These changes are measured starting from, and by reference to, the\ndate of rebalancing instead of the date on which the hedging relationship was designated. For example, if an\nentity originally hedged a volume of 100 tonnes of a commodity at a forward price of CU80 (the forward\nprice at inception of the hedging relationship) and added a volume of 10 tonnes on rebalancing when the\nforward price was CU90, the hedged item after rebalancing would comprise two layers: 100 tonnes hedged\nat CU80 and 10 tonnes hedged at CU90.  \nB6.5.18 Adjusting the hedge ratio by decreasing the volume of the hedging instrument does not affect how the  \nchanges in the value of the hedged item are measured. The measurement of the changes in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument related to the volume that continues to be designated also remains unaffected.\nHowever, from the date of rebalancing, the volume by which the hedging instrument was decreased is no\nlonger part of the hedging relationship. For example, if an entity originally hedged the price risk of a\ncommodity using a derivative volume of 100 tonnes as the hedging instrument and reduces that volume by\n10 tonnes on rebalancing, a nominal amount of 90 tonnes of the hedging instrument volume would remain\n(see paragraph B6.5.16 for the consequences for the derivative volume (ie the 10 tonnes) that is no longer a\npart of the hedging relationship).  \nB6.5.19 Adjusting the hedge ratio by increasing the volume of the hedging instrument does not affect how the  \nchanges in the value of the hedged item are measured. The measurement of the changes in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument related to the previously designated volume also remains unaffected. However, from\nthe date of rebalancing, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument also include the changes in\nthe value of the additional volume of the hedging instrument. The changes are measured starting from, and\nby reference to, the date of rebalancing instead of the date on which the hedging relationship was\ndesignated. For example, if an entity originally hedged the price risk of a commodity using a derivative\nvolume of 100 tonnes as the hedging instrument and added a volume of 10 tonnes on rebalancing, the\nhedging instrument after rebalancing would comprise a total derivative volume of 110 tonnes. The change\nin the fair value of the hedging instrument is the total change in the fair value of the derivatives that make\nup the total volume of 110 tonnes. These derivatives could (and probably would) have different critical\nterms, such as their forward rates, because they were entered into at different points in time (including the\npossibility of designating derivatives into hedging relationships after their initial recognition).  \n-----  B6.5.20 Adjusting the hedge ratio by decreasing the volume of the hedged item does not affect how the changes in  \nthe fair value of the hedging instrument are measured. The measurement of the changes in the value of the\nhedged item related to the volume that continues to be designated also remains unaffected. However, from\nthe date of rebalancing, the volume by which the hedged item was decreased is no longer part of the\nhedging relationship. For example, if an entity originally hedged a volume of 100 tonnes of a commodity at\na forward price of CU80 and reduces that volume by 10 tonnes on rebalancing, the hedged item after\nrebalancing would be 90 tonnes hedged at CU80. The 10 tonnes of the hedged item that are no longer part\nof the hedging relationship would be accounted for in accordance with the requirements for the\ndiscontinuation of hedge accounting (see paragraphs 6.5.6\u20136.5.7 and B6.5.22\u2013B6.5.28).  \nB6.5.21 When rebalancing a hedging relationship, an entity shall update its analysis of the sources of hedge  \nineffectiveness that are expected to affect the hedging relationship during its (remaining) term (see\nparagraph B6.4.2). The documentation of the hedging relationship shall be updated accordingly.",

        "page_content=": "### Discontinuation of hedge accounting\nB6.5.22 Discontinuation of hedge accounting applies prospectively from the date on which the qualifying criteria are  \nno longer met.  \nB6.5.23 An entity shall not de-designate and thereby discontinue a hedging relationship that:  \n(a) still meets the risk management objective on the basis of which it qualified for hedge accounting\n(ie the entity still pursues that risk management objective); and  \n(b) continues to meet all other qualifying criteria (after taking into account any rebalancing of the\nhedging relationship, if applicable).  \nB6.5.24 For the purposes of this Standard, an entity\u2019s risk management strategy is distinguished from its risk  \nmanagement objectives. The risk management strategy is established at the highest level at which an entity\ndetermines how it manages its risk. Risk management strategies typically identify the risks to which the\nentity is exposed and set out how the entity responds to them. A risk management strategy is typically in\nplace for a longer period and may include some flexibility to react to changes in circumstances that occur\nwhile that strategy is in place (for example, different interest rate or commodity price levels that result in a\ndifferent extent of hedging). This is normally set out in a general document that is cascaded down through\nan entity through policies containing more specific guidelines. In contrast, the risk management objective\nfor a hedging relationship applies at the level of a particular hedging relationship. It relates to how the\nparticular hedging instrument that has been designated is used to hedge the particular exposure that has been\ndesignated as the hedged item. Hence, a risk management strategy can involve many different hedging\nrelationships whose risk management objectives relate to executing that overall risk management strategy.\nFor example:  \n(a) an entity has a strategy of managing its interest rate exposure on debt funding that sets ranges for\nthe overall entity for the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding. The strategy is to\nmaintain between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of the debt at fixed rates. The entity decides from\ntime to time how to execute this strategy (ie where it positions itself within the 20 per cent to 40\nper cent range for fixed-rate interest exposure) depending on the level of interest rates. If interest\nrates are low the entity fixes the interest for more debt than when interest rates are high. The\nentity\u2019s debt is CU100 of variable-rate debt of which CU30 is swapped into a fixed-rate exposure.\nThe entity takes advantage of low interest rates to issue an additional CU50 of debt to finance a\nmajor investment, which the entity does by issuing a fixed-rate bond. In the light of the low\ninterest rates, the entity decides to set its fixed interest-rate exposure to 40 per cent of the total\ndebt by reducing by CU20 the extent to which it previously hedged its variable-rate exposure,\nresulting in CU60 of fixed-rate exposure. In this situation the risk management strategy itself\nremains unchanged. However, in contrast the entity\u2019s execution of that strategy has changed and\nthis means that, for CU20 of variable-rate exposure that was previously hedged, the risk\nmanagement objective has changed (ie at the hedging relationship level). Consequently, in this\nsituation hedge accounting must be discontinued for CU20 of the previously hedged variable-rate\nexposure. This could involve reducing the swap position by a CU20 nominal amount but,\ndepending on the circumstances, an entity might retain that swap volume and, for example, use it\nfor hedging a different exposure or it might become part of a trading book. Conversely, if an\nentity instead swapped a part of its new fixed-rate debt into a variable-rate exposure, hedge\naccounting would have to be continued for its previously hedged variable-rate exposure.  \n(b) some exposures result from positions that frequently change, for example, the interest rate risk of\nan open portfolio of debt instruments. The addition of new debt instruments and the derecognition\nof debt instruments continuously change that exposure (ie it is different from simply running off a\nposition that matures). This is a dynamic process in which both the exposure and the hedging  \n-----  instruments used to manage it do not remain the same for long. Consequently, an entity with such\nan exposure frequently adjusts the hedging instruments used to manage the interest rate risk as the\nexposure changes. For example, debt instruments with 24 months\u2019 remaining maturity are\ndesignated as the hedged item for interest rate risk for 24 months. The same procedure is applied\nto other time buckets or maturity periods. After a short period of time, the entity discontinues all,\nsome or a part of the previously designated hedging relationships for maturity periods and\ndesignates new hedging relationships for maturity periods on the basis of their size and the\nhedging instruments that exist at that time. The discontinuation of hedge accounting in this\nsituation reflects that those hedging relationships are established in such a way that the entity\nlooks at a new hedging instrument and a new hedged item instead of the hedging instrument and\nthe hedged item that were designated previously. The risk management strategy remains the\nsame, but there is no risk management objective that continues for those previously designated\nhedging relationships, which as such no longer exist. In such a situation, the discontinuation of\nhedge accounting applies to the extent to which the risk management objective has changed. This\ndepends on the situation of an entity and could, for example, affect all or only some hedging\nrelationships of a maturity period, or only part of a hedging relationship.  \n(c) an entity has a risk management strategy whereby it manages the foreign currency risk of forecast\nsales and the resulting receivables. Within that strategy the entity manages the foreign currency\nrisk as a particular hedging relationship only up to the point of the recognition of the receivable.\nThereafter, the entity no longer manages the foreign currency risk on the basis of that particular\nhedging relationship. Instead, it manages together the foreign currency risk from receivables,\npayables and derivatives (that do not relate to forecast transactions that are still pending)\ndenominated in the same foreign currency. For accounting purposes, this works as a \u2018natural\u2019\nhedge because the gains and losses from the foreign currency risk on all of those items are\nimmediately recognised in profit or loss. Consequently, for accounting purposes, if the hedging\nrelationship is designated for the period up to the payment date, it must be discontinued when the\nreceivable is recognised, because the risk management objective of the original hedging\nrelationship no longer applies. The foreign currency risk is now managed within the same\nstrategy but on a different basis. Conversely, if an entity had a different risk management\nobjective and managed the foreign currency risk as one continuous hedging relationship\nspecifically for that forecast sales amount and the resulting receivable until the settlement date,\nhedge accounting would continue until that date.  \nB6.5.25 The discontinuation of hedge accounting can affect:  \n(a) a hedging relationship in its entirety; or  \n(b) a part of a hedging relationship (which means that hedge accounting continues for the remainder\nof the hedging relationship).  \nB6.5.26 A hedging relationship is discontinued in its entirety when, as a whole, it ceases to meet the qualifying  \ncriteria. For example:  \n(a) the hedging relationship no longer meets the risk management objective on the basis of which it\nqualified for hedge accounting (ie the entity no longer pursues that risk management objective);  \n(b) the hedging instrument or instruments have been sold or terminated (in relation to the entire\nvolume that was part of the hedging relationship); or  \n(c) there is no longer an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument\nor the effect of credit risk starts to dominate the value changes that result from that economic\nrelationship.  \nB6.5.27 A part of a hedging relationship is discontinued (and hedge accounting continues for its remainder) when  \nonly a part of the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. For example:  \n(a) on rebalancing of the hedging relationship, the hedge ratio might be adjusted in such a way that\nsome of the volume of the hedged item is no longer part of the hedging relationship (see\nparagraph B6.5.20); hence, hedge accounting is discontinued only for the volume of the hedged\nitem that is no longer part of the hedging relationship; or  \n(b) when the occurrence of some of the volume of the hedged item that is (or is a component of) a\nforecast transaction is no longer highly probable, hedge accounting is discontinued only for the\nvolume of the hedged item whose occurrence is no longer highly probable. However, if an entity\nhas a history of having designated hedges of forecast transactions and having subsequently\ndetermined that the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, the entity\u2019s ability to\npredict forecast transactions accurately is called into question when predicting similar forecast  \n-----  transactions. This affects the assessment of whether similar forecast transactions are highly\nprobable (see paragraph 6.3.3) and hence whether they are eligible as hedged items.  \nB6.5.28 An entity can designate a new hedging relationship that involves the hedging instrument or hedged item of a  \nprevious hedging relationship for which hedge accounting was (in part or in its entirety) discontinued. This\ndoes not constitute a continuation of a hedging relationship but is a restart. For example:  \n(a) a hedging instrument experiences such a severe credit deterioration that the entity replaces it with\na new hedging instrument. This means that the original hedging relationship failed to achieve the\nrisk management objective and is hence discontinued in its entirety. The new hedging instrument\nis designated as the hedge of the same exposure that was hedged previously and forms a new\nhedging relationship. Hence, the changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item are\nmeasured starting from, and by reference to, the date of designation of the new hedging\nrelationship instead of the date on which the original hedging relationship was designated.  \n(b) a hedging relationship is discontinued before the end of its term. The hedging instrument in that\nhedging relationship can be designated as the hedging instrument in another hedging relationship\n(for example, when adjusting the hedge ratio on rebalancing by increasing the volume of the\nhedging instrument or when designating a whole new hedging relationship).",

        "page_content=": "### Accounting for the time value of options\nB6.5.29 An option can be considered as being related to a time period because its time value represents a charge for  \nproviding protection for the option holder over a period of time. However, the relevant aspect for the\npurpose of assessing whether an option hedges a transaction or time-period related hedged item are the\ncharacteristics of that hedged item, including how and when it affects profit or loss. Hence, an entity shall\nassess the type of hedged item (see paragraph 6.5.15(a)) on the basis of the nature of the hedged item\n(regardless of whether the hedging relationship is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge):  \n(a) the time value of an option relates to a transaction related hedged item if the nature of the hedged\nitem is a transaction for which the time value has the character of costs of that transaction. An\nexample is when the time value of an option relates to a hedged item that results in the\nrecognition of an item whose initial measurement includes transaction costs (for example, an\nentity hedges a commodity purchase, whether it is a forecast transaction or a firm commitment,\nagainst the commodity price risk and includes the transaction costs in the initial measurement of\nthe inventory). As a consequence of including the time value of the option in the initial\nmeasurement of the particular hedged item, the time value affects profit or loss at the same time\nas that hedged item. Similarly, an entity that hedges a sale of a commodity, whether it is a\nforecast transaction or a firm commitment, would include the time value of the option as part of\nthe cost related to that sale (hence, the time value would be recognised in profit or loss in the\nsame period as the revenue from the hedged sale).  \n(b) the time value of an option relates to a time-period related hedged item if the nature of the hedged\nitem is such that the time value has the character of a cost for obtaining protection against a risk\nover a particular period of time (but the hedged item does not result in a transaction that involves\nthe notion of a transaction cost in accordance with (a)). For example, if commodity inventory is\nhedged against a fair value decrease for six months using a commodity option with a\ncorresponding life, the time value of the option would be allocated to profit or loss (ie amortised\non a systematic and rational basis) over that six-month period. Another example is a hedge of a\nnet investment in a foreign operation that is hedged for 18 months using a foreign-exchange\noption, which would result in allocating the time value of the option over that 18-month period.  \nB6.5.30 The characteristics of the hedged item, including how and when the hedged item affects profit or loss, also  \naffect the period over which the time value of an option that hedges a time-period related hedged item is\namortised, which is consistent with the period over which the option\u2019s intrinsic value can affect profit or\nloss in accordance with hedge accounting. For example, if an interest rate option (a cap) is used to provide\nprotection against increases in the interest expense on a floating rate bond, the time value of that cap is\namortised to profit or loss over the same period over which any intrinsic value of the cap would affect profit\nor loss:  \n(a) if the cap hedges increases in interest rates for the first three years out of a total life of the floating\nrate bond of five years, the time value of that cap is amortised over the first three years; or  \n(b) if the cap is a forward start option that hedges increases in interest rates for years two and three\nout of a total life of the floating rate bond of five years, the time value of that cap is amortised\nduring years two and three.  \n-----  B6.5.31 The accounting for the time value of options in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15 also applies to a  \ncombination of a purchased and a written option (one being a put option and one being a call option) that at\nthe date of designation as a hedging instrument has a net nil time value (commonly referred to as a \u2018zerocost collar\u2019). In that case, an entity shall recognise any changes in time value in other comprehensive\nincome, even though the cumulative change in time value over the total period of the hedging relationship is\nnil. Hence, if the time value of the option relates to:  \n(a) a transaction related hedged item, the amount of time value at the end of the hedging relationship\nthat adjusts the hedged item or that is reclassified to profit or loss (see paragraph 6.5.15(b)) would\nbe nil.  \n(b) a time-period related hedged item, the amortisation expense related to the time value is nil.  \nB6.5.32 The accounting for the time value of options in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15 applies only to the extent  \nthat the time value relates to the hedged item (aligned time value). The time value of an option relates to the\nhedged item if the critical terms of the option (such as the nominal amount, life and underlying) are aligned\nwith the hedged item. Hence, if the critical terms of the option and the hedged item are not fully aligned, an\nentity shall determine the aligned time value, ie how much of the time value included in the premium\n(actual time value) relates to the hedged item (and therefore should be treated in accordance with paragraph\n6.5.15). An entity determines the aligned time value using the valuation of the option that would have\ncritical terms that perfectly match the hedged item.  \nB6.5.33 If the actual time value and the aligned time value differ, an entity shall determine the amount that is  \naccumulated in a separate component of equity in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15 as follows:  \n(a) if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the actual time value is higher than the aligned time\nvalue, the entity shall:  \n(i) determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity on the\nbasis of the aligned time value; and  \n(ii) account for the differences in the fair value changes between the two time values in\nprofit or loss.  \n(b) if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the actual time value is lower than the aligned time\nvalue, the entity shall determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity\nby reference to the lower of the cumulative change in fair value of:  \n(i) the actual time value; and  \n(ii) the aligned time value.  \nAny remainder of the change in fair value of the actual time value shall be recognised in profit or loss.  \n**Accounting for the forward element of forward contracts and foreign currency**\n**basis spreads of financial instruments**  \nB6.5.34 A forward contract can be considered as being related to a time period because its forward element  \nrepresents charges for a period of time (which is the tenor for which it is determined). However, the relevant\naspect for the purpose of assessing whether a hedging instrument hedges a transaction or time-period related\nhedged item are the characteristics of that hedged item, including how and when it affects profit or loss.\nHence, an entity shall assess the type of hedged item (see paragraphs 6.5.16 and 6.5.15(a)) on the basis of\nthe nature of the hedged item (regardless of whether the hedging relationship is a cash flow hedge or a fair\nvalue hedge):  \n(a) the forward element of a forward contract relates to a transaction related hedged item if the nature\nof the hedged item is a transaction for which the forward element has the character of costs of that\ntransaction. An example is when the forward element relates to a hedged item that results in the\nrecognition of an item whose initial measurement includes transaction costs (for example, an\nentity hedges an inventory purchase denominated in a foreign currency, whether it is a forecast\ntransaction or a firm commitment, against foreign currency risk and includes the transaction costs\nin the initial measurement of the inventory). As a consequence of including the forward element\nin the initial measurement of the particular hedged item, the forward element affects profit or loss\nat the same time as that hedged item. Similarly, an entity that hedges a sale of a commodity\ndenominated in a foreign currency against foreign currency risk, whether it is a forecast\ntransaction or a firm commitment, would include the forward element as part of the cost that is\nrelated to that sale (hence, the forward element would be recognised in profit or loss in the same\nperiod as the revenue from the hedged sale).  \n(b) the forward element of a forward contract relates to a time-period related hedged item if the\nnature of the hedged item is such that the forward element has the character of a cost for  \n-----  obtaining protection against a risk over a particular period of time (but the hedged item does not\nresult in a transaction that involves the notion of a transaction cost in accordance with (a)). For\nexample, if commodity inventory is hedged against changes in fair value for six months using a\ncommodity forward contract with a corresponding life, the forward element of the forward\ncontract would be allocated to profit or loss (ie amortised on a systematic and rational basis) over\nthat six-month period. Another example is a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that\nis hedged for 18 months using a foreign-exchange forward contract, which would result in\nallocating the forward element of the forward contract over that 18-month period.  \nB6.5.35 The characteristics of the hedged item, including how and when the hedged item affects profit or loss, also  \naffect the period over which the forward element of a forward contract that hedges a time-period related\nhedged item is amortised, which is over the period to which the forward element relates. For example, if a\nforward contract hedges the exposure to variability in three-month interest rates for a three-month period\nthat starts in six months\u2019 time, the forward element is amortised during the period that spans months seven\nto nine.  \nB6.5.36 The accounting for the forward element of a forward contract in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16 also  \napplies if, at the date on which the forward contract is designated as a hedging instrument, the forward\nelement is nil. In that case, an entity shall recognise any fair value changes attributable to the forward\nelement in other comprehensive income, even though the cumulative fair value change attributable to the\nforward element over the total period of the hedging relationship is nil. Hence, if the forward element of a\nforward contract relates to:  \n(a) a transaction related hedged item, the amount in respect of the forward element at the end of the\nhedging relationship that adjusts the hedged item or that is reclassified to profit or loss (see\nparagraphs 6.5.15(b) and 6.5.16) would be nil.  \n(b) a time-period related hedged item, the amortisation amount related to the forward element is nil.  \nB6.5.37 The accounting for the forward element of forward contracts in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16 applies  \nonly to the extent that the forward element relates to the hedged item (aligned forward element). The\nforward element of a forward contract relates to the hedged item if the critical terms of the forward contract\n(such as the nominal amount, life and underlying) are aligned with the hedged item. Hence, if the critical\nterms of the forward contract and the hedged item are not fully aligned, an entity shall determine the aligned\nforward element, ie how much of the forward element included in the forward contract (actual forward\nelement) relates to the hedged item (and therefore should be treated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16).\nAn entity determines the aligned forward element using the valuation of the forward contract that would\nhave critical terms that perfectly match the hedged item.  \nB6.5.38 If the actual forward element and the aligned forward element differ, an entity shall determine the amount  \nthat is accumulated in a separate component of equity in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16 as follows:  \n(a) if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the absolute amount of the actual forward element is\nhigher than that of the aligned forward element the entity shall:  \n(i) determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity on the\nbasis of the aligned forward element; and  \n(ii) account for the differences in the fair value changes between the two forward elements\nin profit or loss.  \n(b) if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the absolute amount of the actual forward element is\nlower than that of the aligned forward element, the entity shall determine the amount that is\naccumulated in a separate component of equity by reference to the lower of the cumulative\nchange in fair value of:  \n(i) the absolute amount of the actual forward element; and  \n(ii) the absolute amount of the aligned forward element.  \nAny remainder of the change in fair value of the actual forward element shall be recognised in profit or loss.  \nB6.5.39 When an entity separates the foreign currency basis spread from a financial instrument and excludes it from  \nthe designation of that financial instrument as the hedging instrument (see paragraph 6.2.4(b)), the\napplication guidance in paragraphs B6.5.34\u2013B6.5.38 applies to the foreign currency basis spread in the\nsame manner as it is applied to the forward element of a forward contract.  \n-----  ",

Normally this would be approved by key management\npersonnel as defined in AASB 124.  \nB6.6.2 For example, Entity A, whose functional currency is its local currency, has a firm commitment to pay\nFC150,000 for advertising expenses in nine months\u2019 time and a firm commitment to sell finished goods for\nFC150,000 in 15 months\u2019 time. Entity A enters into a foreign currency derivative that settles in nine\nmonths\u2019 time under which it receives FC100 and pays CU70. Entity A has no other exposures to FC. Entity\nA does not manage foreign currency risk on a net basis. Hence, Entity A cannot apply hedge accounting for\na hedging relationship between the foreign currency derivative and a net position of FC100 (consisting of\nFC150,000 of the firm purchase commitment \u2013 ie advertising services \u2013 and FC149,900 (of the FC150,000)\nof the firm sale commitment) for a nine-month period.  \nB6.6.3 If Entity A did manage foreign currency risk on a net basis and did not enter into the foreign currency\nderivative (because it increases its foreign currency risk exposure instead of reducing it), then the entity\nwould be in a natural hedged position for nine months. Normally, this hedged position would not be\nreflected in the financial statements because the transactions are recognised in different reporting periods in\nthe future. The nil net position would be eligible for hedge accounting only if the conditions in paragraph\n6.6.6 are met.  \nB6.6.4 When a group of items that constitute a net position is designated as a hedged item, an entity shall designate\nthe overall group of items that includes the items that can make up the net position. An entity is not\npermitted to designate a non-specific abstract amount of a net position. For example, an entity has a group\nof firm sale commitments in nine months\u2019 time for FC100 and a group of firm purchase commitments in 18\nmonths\u2019 time for FC120. The entity cannot designate an abstract amount of a net position up to FC20.\nInstead, it must designate a gross amount of purchases and a gross amount of sales that together give rise to\nthe hedged net position. An entity shall designate gross positions that give rise to the net position so that the\nentity is able to comply with the requirements for the accounting for qualifying hedging relationships.  \n**_Application of the hedge effectiveness requirements to a hedge of a net_**\n**_position_**  \nB6.6.5 When an entity determines whether the hedge effectiveness requirements of paragraph 6.4.1(c) are met\nwhen it hedges a net position, it shall consider the changes in the value of the items in the net position that\nhave a similar effect as the hedging instrument in conjunction with the fair value change on the hedging\ninstrument. For example, an entity has a group of firm sale commitments in nine months\u2019 time for FC100\nand a group of firm purchase commitments in 18 months\u2019 time for FC120. It hedges the foreign currency\nrisk of the net position of FC20 using a forward exchange contract for FC20. When determining whether the\nhedge effectiveness requirements of paragraph 6.4.1(c) are met, the entity shall consider the relationship\nbetween:  \n(a) the fair value change on the forward exchange contract together with the foreign currency risk\nrelated changes in the value of the firm sale commitments; and  \n(b) the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm purchase commitments.  \nB6.6.6 Similarly, if in the example in paragraph B6.6.5 the entity had a nil net position it would consider the\nrelationship between the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm sale commitments\nand the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm purchase commitments when\ndetermining whether the hedge effectiveness requirements of paragraph 6.4.1(c) are met.  \n**_Cash flow hedges that constitute a net position_**  \nB6.6.7 When an entity hedges a group of items with offsetting risk positions (ie a net position), the eligibility for\nhedge accounting depends on the type of hedge. If the hedge is a fair value hedge, then the net position may\nbe eligible as a hedged item. If, however, the hedge is a cash flow hedge, then the net position can only be\neligible as a hedged item if it is a hedge of foreign currency risk and the designation of that net position  \n-----  specifies the reporting period in which the forecast transactions are expected to affect profit or loss and also\nspecifies their nature and volume.  \nB6.6.8 For example, an entity has a net position that consists of a bottom layer of FC100 of sales and a bottom\nlayer of FC150 of purchases. Both sales and purchases are denominated in the same foreign currency. In\norder to sufficiently specify the designation of the hedged net position, the entity specifies in the original\ndocumentation of the hedging relationship that sales can be of Product A or Product B and purchases can be\nof Machinery Type A, Machinery Type B and Raw Material A. The entity also specifies the volumes of the\ntransactions by each nature. The entity documents that the bottom layer of sales (FC100) is made up of a\nforecast sales volume of the first FC70 of Product A and the first FC30 of Product B. If those sales volumes\nare expected to affect profit or loss in different reporting periods, the entity would include that in the\ndocumentation, for example, the first FC70 from sales of Product A that are expected to affect profit or loss\nin the first reporting period and the first FC30 from sales of Product B that are expected to affect profit or\nloss in the second reporting period. The entity also documents that the bottom layer of the purchases\n(FC150) is made up of purchases of the first FC60 of Machinery Type A, the first FC40 of Machinery Type\nB and the first FC50 of Raw Material A. If those purchase volumes are expected to affect profit or loss in\ndifferent reporting periods, the entity would include in the documentation a disaggregation of the purchase\nvolumes by the reporting periods in which they are expected to affect profit or loss (similarly to how it\ndocuments the sales volumes). For example, the forecast transaction would be specified as:  \n(a) the first FC60 of purchases of Machinery Type A that are expected to affect profit or loss from\nthe third reporting period over the next ten reporting periods;  \n(b) the first FC40 of purchases of Machinery Type B that are expected to affect profit or loss from\nthe fourth reporting period over the next 20 reporting periods; and  \n(c) the first FC50 of purchases of Raw Material A that are expected to be received in the third\nreporting period and sold, ie affect profit or loss, in that and the next reporting period.  \nSpecifying the nature of the forecast transaction volumes would include aspects such as the depreciation\npattern for items of property, plant and equipment of the same kind, if the nature of those items is such that\nthe depreciation pattern could vary depending on how the entity uses those items. For example, if the entity\nuses items of Machinery Type A in two different production processes that result in straight-line\ndepreciation over ten reporting periods and the units of production method respectively, its documentation\nof the forecast purchase volume for Machinery Type A would disaggregate that volume by which of those\ndepreciation patterns will apply.  \nB6.6.9 For a cash flow hedge of a net position, the amounts determined in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11 shall\ninclude the changes in the value of the items in the net position that have a similar effect as the hedging\ninstrument in conjunction with the fair value change on the hedging instrument. However, the changes in\nthe value of the items in the net position that have a similar effect as the hedging instrument are recognised\nonly once the transactions that they relate to are recognised, such as when a forecast sale is recognised as\nrevenue. For example, an entity has a group of highly probable forecast sales in nine months\u2019 time for\nFC100 and a group of highly probable forecast purchases in 18 months\u2019 time for FC120. It hedges the\nforeign currency risk of the net position of FC20 using a forward exchange contract for FC20. When\ndetermining the amounts that are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with\nparagraph 6.5.11(a)\u20136.5.11(b), the entity compares:  \n(a) the fair value change on the forward exchange contract together with the foreign currency risk\nrelated changes in the value of the highly probable forecast sales; with  \n(b) the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly probable forecast purchases.  \nHowever, the entity recognises only amounts related to the forward exchange contract until the highly\nprobable forecast sales transactions are recognised in the financial statements, at which time the gains or\nlosses on those forecast transactions are recognised (ie the change in the value attributable to the change in\nthe foreign exchange rate between the designation of the hedging relationship and the recognition of\nrevenue).  \nB6.6.10 Similarly, if in the example the entity had a nil net position it would compare the foreign currency risk  \nrelated changes in the value of the highly probable forecast sales with the foreign currency risk related\nchanges in the value of the highly probable forecast purchases. However, those amounts are recognised only\nonce the related forecast transactions are recognised in the financial statements.",

The presentation of hedging gains or losses in\nthat statement depends on the group of items.  \nB6.6.14 If the group of items does not have any offsetting risk positions (for example, a group of foreign currency  \nexpenses that affect different line items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income\nthat are hedged for foreign currency risk) then the reclassified hedging instrument gains or losses shall be\napportioned to the line items affected by the hedged items. This apportionment shall be done on a\nsystematic and rational basis and shall not result in the grossing up of the net gains or losses arising from a\nsingle hedging instrument.  \nB6.6.15 If the group of items does have offsetting risk positions (for example, a group of sales and expenses  \ndenominated in a foreign currency hedged together for foreign currency risk) then an entity shall present the\nhedging gains or losses in a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive\nincome. Consider, for example, a hedge of the foreign currency risk of a net position of foreign currency\nsales of FC100 and foreign currency expenses of FC80 using a forward exchange contract for FC20. The\ngain or loss on the forward exchange contract that is reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit\nor loss (when the net position affects profit or loss) shall be presented in a separate line item from the\nhedged sales and expenses. Moreover, if the sales occur in an earlier period than the expenses, the sales\nrevenue is still measured at the spot exchange rate in accordance with AASB 121. The related hedging gain\nor loss is presented in a separate line item, so that profit or loss reflects the effect of hedging the net\nposition, with a corresponding adjustment to the cash flow hedge reserve. When the hedged expenses affect\nprofit or loss in a later period, the hedging gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve\non the sales is reclassified to profit or loss and presented as a separate line item from those that include the\nhedged expenses, which are measured at the spot exchange rate in accordance with AASB 121.  \nB6.6.16 For some types of fair value hedges, the objective of the hedge is not primarily to offset the fair value  \nchange of the hedged item but instead to transform the cash flows of the hedged item. For example, an\nentity hedges the fair value interest rate risk of a fixed-rate debt instrument using an interest rate swap. The\nentity\u2019s hedge objective is to transform the fixed-interest cash flows into floating interest cash flows. This\nobjective is reflected in the accounting for the hedging relationship by accruing the net interest accrual on\nthe interest rate swap in profit or loss. In the case of a hedge of a net position (for example, a net position of\na fixed-rate asset and a fixed-rate liability), this net interest accrual must be presented in a separate line item\nin the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. This is to avoid the grossing up of a\nsingle instrument\u2019s net gains or losses into offsetting gross amounts and recognising them in different line\nitems (for example, this avoids grossing up a net interest receipt on a single interest rate swap into gross\ninterest revenue and gross interest expense).",

        "page_content=": "## Definitions (Appendix A)  \nDerivatives  \nBA.1 Typical examples of derivatives are futures and forward, swap and option contracts. A derivative usually\nhas a notional amount, which is an amount of currency, a number of shares, a number of units of weight or\nvolume or other units specified in the contract. However, a derivative instrument does not require the holder\nor writer to invest or receive the notional amount at the inception of the contract. Alternatively, a derivative\ncould require a fixed payment or payment of an amount that can change (but not proportionally with a\nchange in the underlying) as a result of some future event that is unrelated to a notional amount. For\nexample, a contract may require a fixed payment of CU1,000 if six-month LIBOR increases by 100 basis\npoints. Such a contract is a derivative even though a notional amount is not specified.  \nBA.2 The definition of a derivative in this Standard includes contracts that are settled gross by delivery of the\nunderlying item (eg a forward contract to purchase a fixed rate debt instrument). An entity may have a\ncontract to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument or\nby exchanging financial instruments (eg a contract to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price at a future\ndate). Such a contract is within the scope of this Standard unless it was entered into and continues to be held\nfor the purpose of delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity\u2019s expected purchase, sale or\nusage requirements. However, this Standard applies to such contracts for an entity\u2019s expected purchase, sale\nor usage requirements if the entity makes a designation in accordance with paragraph 2.5 (see paragraphs\n2.4\u20132.7).  \nBA.3 One of the defining characteristics of a derivative is that it has an initial net investment that is smaller than\nwould be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes\nin market factors. An option contract meets that definition because the premium is less than the investment\nthat would be required to obtain the underlying financial instrument to which the option is linked. A\ncurrency swap that requires an initial exchange of different currencies of equal fair values meets the\ndefinition because it has a zero initial net investment.  \nBA.4 A regular way purchase or sale gives rise to a fixed price commitment between trade date and settlement\ndate that meets the definition of a derivative. However, because of the short duration of the commitment it\nis not recognised as a derivative financial instrument. Instead, this Standard provides for special accounting\nfor such regular way contracts (see paragraphs 3.1.2 and B3.1.3\u2013B3.1.6).  \nBA.5 The definition of a derivative refers to non-financial variables that are not specific to a party to the contract.\nThese include an index of earthquake losses in a particular region and an index of temperatures in a\nparticular city. Non-financial variables specific to a party to the contract include the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of a party to the contract. A change in the fair value of\na non-financial asset is specific to the owner if the fair value reflects not only changes in market prices for\nsuch assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of the specific non-financial asset held (a nonfinancial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car exposes the guarantor\nto the risk of changes in the car\u2019s physical condition, the change in that residual value is specific to the\nowner of the car.",

        "page_content=": "## Non-contractual receivables arising from statutory requirements  \nC3 The scope of AASB 9 depends on the definition of a financial instrument, which is any contract that gives\nrise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\nTherefore, AASB 9 specifically addresses financial assets (and financial liabilities) that arise from\ncontracts.  \nC4 Financial assets include contractual rights to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity.\nHowever, in a not-for-profit context, a receivable may arise from statutory requirements rather than through\na contract (for example, rates, taxes and fines). The nature of such a receivable arising from statutory\nrequirements is, in substance, similar to a contractual receivable, as the statutory requirements also provide\nan entity with a right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity.  \nC5 Accordingly, an entity recognises and measures a statutory receivable as if it were a financial asset when\nstatutory requirements establish a right for the entity to receive cash or another financial asset. Such a right\narises on the occurrence of a past event.  \nC6 A past event relating to taxes occurs as specified for each tax levied in the relevant taxation law. Examples\nof taxable events include:  \n(a) income tax \u2013 the end of the taxation period in respect of which taxable income of a taxpayer is\ndetermined;  \n(b) goods and services tax \u2013 the purchase or sale of taxable goods and services during the taxation\nperiod;  \n(c) customs duty \u2013 the movement of dutiable goods or services across the customs boundary; and  \n(d) property tax \u2013 the passing of the date on which the tax is levied, or, if the tax is levied on a\nperiodic basis, the period for which the tax is levied.  \nC7 In some instances, assets arising from taxable events cannot be measured reliably until after the taxing\nentity\u2019s financial statements are authorised for issue. This may occur, for example, if a tax base is volatile\nand reliable estimation is not possible. Consequently, in those cases, the assets would be recognised in a\nperiod subsequent to the occurrence of the taxable event, which may be several reporting periods after the\ntaxable event.  \nC8 It is unlikely that taxes or fines will qualify as assets of the government agency or department responsible\nfor their collection. This is because the government agency or department responsible for collecting taxes\nor fines does not normally control the future economic benefits embodied in tax collections, and the taxes\nand fines are controlled at a whole of government level.  \n-----  ",

If an entity elects to apply this Standard early, it must disclose that fact and apply\nall of the requirements in this Standard at the same time (but see also paragraphs 7.1.2, 7.2.21 and 7.3.2).

However, for annual periods\nbeginning before 1 January 2018, an entity may elect to apply those earlier versions of IFRS 9 instead of\napplying this Standard if, and only if, the entity\u2019s relevant date of initial application is before 1 February\n2015.  \n-----  ",
