For some members, the provision of less detailed\ninformation is expected to be sufficient to meet their needs for an understanding of the financial\nperformance, financial position and financing and investing activities of the company, registered scheme or\ndisclosing entity.  \n11 The minimum content required by this Standard is intended also to provide sufficient information to permit\nmembers to identify if and when they consider it would be useful to obtain more comprehensive and\ndetailed information by requesting a copy of the financial report.  \n-----  ",

Any**\n**other information included in a concise financial report shall be consistent with the financial report of**\n**the entity.**  \n13 In order to achieve consistency and comparability with information included in the financial report, this\nStandard requires the accounting policies relating to recognition and measurement applied in the\npreparation of a concise financial report to be the same as those adopted in the preparation of the financial\nreport.  \n14 This Standard prescribes the minimum information to be disclosed in a concise financial report but does not\nprescribe the format in which that information is presented. The format for the presentation of information\nin a concise financial report is developed having regard to the particular circumstances of the entity and the\npresentation of relevant, reliable, understandable and comparable information about the entity\u2019s financial\nperformance, financial position and financing and investing activities. Entities are encouraged to develop a\nformat that best meets the information needs of their members.  \n15 The consistency required by paragraph 12 means that information voluntarily included in the concise\nfinancial report is determined in accordance with the treatment adopted in the financial report. When the\ninformation in the financial report was determined in accordance with an Accounting Standard, the same\ntreatment is adopted in the concise financial report.  \n**16** **The nature and estimated magnitude of particular items are disclosed if it is likely that the concise**\n**financial report would be misleading without such disclosures.**  \n17 The content of a concise financial report specified in this Standard constitutes the minimum level of\ndisclosure. Where there are particular features of the operations and activities of the entity that are\nsignificant, the entity may need to provide additional information in the concise financial report in order to\ncomply with paragraph 16. Similarly, members benefit from industry-specific disclosures, for example,\ndisclosure of additional information by mining companies in relation to exploration and evaluation\nexpenditure and decommissioning costs, and by banks and other financial institutions in relation to doubtful\ndebts.",

        "page_content=": "## Financial Statements  \n**18** **A concise financial report shall include the following financial statements:**  \n**(a)** **a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the annual reporting**\n**period;**  \n**(b)** **a statement of financial position as at the end of the annual reporting period;**  \n**(c)** **a statement of cash flows for the annual reporting period; and**  \n**(d)** **a statement of changes in equity for the annual reporting period.**  \n19 In accordance with paragraph 10A of AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, an entity may\npresent all items of income and expense recognised in a period in a single statement of profit or loss and\nother comprehensive income or present the profit or loss section in a separate statement of profit or loss.  \n**20** **Each financial statement shall be presented as it is in the financial report, in accordance with other**\n**Accounting Standards, except for the omission of cross-references to notes to the financial statements**\n**in the financial report.**  \n21 All the notes to the financial statements required by other Accounting Standards are not required in the\nconcise financial report. For example, this Standard does not require an entity that uses the direct method in\nthe statement of cash flows to provide a reconciliation of cash flows arising from operating activities to\nprofit or loss. However, information required in some notes by other Accounting Standards is required\nwhen specified in this Standard.  \n22 It is recommended that the financial statements in the concise financial report be cross-referenced, where\nappropriate, to disclosures included in the concise financial report.  \n23 When the entity is a parent and only the consolidated financial statements are presented, the lack of\nfinancial statements for the parent would not be regarded as contravening paragraph 21.  \n**24** **The financial statements of entities other than listed companies shall be accompanied by discussion**\n**and analysis to assist the understanding of members.**  \n-----  25 Listed companies are not required by this Standard to provide discussion and analysis in the concise\nfinancial report because, unlike other entities, they are required by section 299A of the Corporations Act to\nprovide an operational and financial report in the Directors\u2019 Report that is part of the concise report.\nParagraph 24 only exempts listed companies from the statutory obligation to provide discussion and\nanalysis of the financial statements. It does not prohibit a listed company from providing any discussion\nand analysis that it considers would assist a reader to understand the financial statements in the concise\nfinancial report.  \n26 The information reported in the financial statements will be enhanced by a discussion and analysis of the\nprincipal factors affecting the financial performance, financial position and financing and investing\nactivities of the entity. The extent of the discussion and analysis provided will vary from entity to entity,\nand from year to year, as is necessary in the circumstances to help compensate for the brevity of the concise\nfinancial report compared with the financial report.  \n27 In most situations, the content of the discussion and analysis would cover at least the following areas:  \n(a) in relation to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income:  \n(i) trends in revenues;  \n(ii) the effects of significant economic or other events on the operations of the entity;  \n(iii) the main influences on costs of operations; and  \n(iv) measures of financial performance such as return on sales, return on assets and return\non equity;  \n(b) in relation to the statement of financial position:  \n(i) changes in the composition of assets;  \n(ii) the relationship between debt and equity; and  \n(iii) significant movements in assets, liabilities and equity items;  \n(c) in relation to the statement of cash flows:  \n(i) changes in cash flows from operations;  \n(ii) financing of capital expenditure programs; and  \n(iii) servicing and repayment of borrowings; and  \n(d) in relation to the statement of changes in equity:  \n(i) changes in the composition of the components of equity; and  \n(ii) causes of significant changes in subscribed capital, such as rights issues, share buybacks or capital reductions.",
