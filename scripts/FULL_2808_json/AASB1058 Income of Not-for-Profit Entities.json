For example, an entity that receives a\ncash grant to be used to further its objectives might not have provided any consideration in exchange for that\ncash. As another example, governments are entitled to non-contractual receivables arising from statutory\nrequirements such as taxes and rates without providing consideration to the other party \u2013 those receivables\nprovide income to the government to further its objectives.

Any not-for-profit entity may elect\nto recognise volunteer services received if their fair value can be measured reliably irrespective of whether\nthat entity would have purchased those services if not donated.  \n5 AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers defines income as increases in economic benefits during\nthe accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result\nin increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions by equity participants (that is, owners). This\nStandard addresses income arising from the acquisition of assets for consideration that is significantly less\nthan the fair value of the asset when that difference is principally to enable the not-for-profit entity to further\nits objectives. This Standard applies to those differences that result in increases in equity, other than those\nrelating to contributions by owners or those accounted for under another Standard (eg AASB 15). Other\nAustralian Accounting Standards (eg AASB 1004 Contributions) address income arising from decreases of\nliabilities and the accounting for contributions by owners.  \n6 An entity shall apply the requirements of this Standard to each transaction based on the substance of the\ntransaction, rather than its legal form or the description given to it (eg grants or donations), so as to provide a\nfaithful representation of the economic substance of the transaction.  \n-----  ",

The Appendix also\nclarifies the measurement of revenue and contract liabilities where the transaction price includes an amount\nthat would otherwise be separately recognised and accounted for as income immediately in accordance with\nthis Standard.  \n12 For the purposes of this Standard, income is determined as the difference between the consideration for an\nasset and the asset\u2019s fair value, after recognising any other related amounts. An entity applies judgement in\ndetermining the extent to which the acquisition of an asset gives rise to income as specified by this Standard\nor to revenue, a liability or a contribution by owners recognised in accordance with another Australian\nAccounting Standard.  \n-----  13 An entity might acquire an asset and also recognise related amounts that in total exceed the initial\nmeasurement of the asset. In such cases, the entity shall reassess whether it has appropriately identified and\nmeasured all the related amounts. If an excess remains after restating any related amounts, the entity shall\nrecognise an expense immediately in profit or loss for the excess of the related amounts over the carrying\namount of the asset acquired.

The entity shall recognise income in profit or loss when (or as) the entity satisfies its**\n**obligations under the transfer.**  \n17 In such circumstances, the transferor has in substance transferred a recognisable non-financial asset to the\nentity. The entity recognises the financial asset received in accordance with AASB 9 and subsequently\nrecognises the acquired or constructed non-financial asset in accordance with the applicable Australian\nAccounting Standard (eg AASB 116 for property, plant and equipment). This Standard requires the entity\nto initially recognise a liability representing the entity\u2019s obligation to acquire or construct the non-financial\nasset and, if applicable, other performance obligations under AASB 15, which involve the transfer of goods\nor services to other parties. The liability in relation to acquiring or constructing the non-financial asset is\ninitially measured at the carrying amount of the financial asset received from the transferor that is not\nattributable to related amounts for performance obligations under AASB 15, contributions by owners, etc.\nThe liability is recognised until such time when (or as) the entity satisfies its obligations under the transfer.",

Examples include:  \n(a) cash and other assets received from grants, bequests or donations;  \n(b) receipts of appropriations by government departments and other public sector entities;  \n(c) receipts of taxes, rates or fines; and  \n(d) assets acquired for nominal or low amounts.  \n-----  B3 Where an asset is acquired for consideration that is significantly less than fair value but that difference is\nnot principally related to furthering the entity\u2019s objectives, the transaction is not within the scope of this\nStandard. Examples of such transactions include:  \n(a) distress sales; and  \n(b) trade discounts.  \nB4 When assessing whether the consideration for an asset is less than fair value principally to enable the entity\nto further its objectives, the entity may consider whether another entity could have obtained the asset under\nthe same terms and conditions. If those terms and conditions are generally not available to other entities of\nthe same class/nature, it is more likely that the difference between the consideration for the asset and the\nfair value of the asset acquired is principally for enabling the entity to further its objectives. For example,\ntrade discounts available to all not-for-profit entities, but not to for-profit entities, are not considered\nprincipally to further the specific not-for-profit entity\u2019s objectives.  \nB5 Where the consideration provided under a transaction solely involves performance obligations recognised in\naccordance with AASB 15, the asset is not acquired for consideration that is significantly less than fair\nvalue. Therefore, the transaction is not within the scope of this Standard.  \nB6 Transfers with consideration significantly less than fair value primarily to enable a not-for-profit entity to\nfurther its objectives may be called grants, bequests, donations or appropriations and are usually made\nvoluntarily. Such transfers could be in the form of cash or another financial asset, goods, or volunteer\nservices, and may or may not be made with restrictions or conditions on their use. Transactions may\ninclude elements with consideration that is significantly less than fair value primarily to enable the not-forprofit entity to further its objectives and other elements with consideration at fair value. For example, a\ndonation by a customer may be present in a contract in which a customer promises consideration in\nexchange for goods or services (eg a fundraising dinner).  \nB7 Volunteer services are services transferred by individuals or other entities without charge or for\nconsideration significantly less than the fair value of those services. Whether such services (when\nrecognised in accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19) are recognised as an asset or an expense depends on\nthe entity\u2019s determination whether it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity beyond the\ncurrent accounting period. In many instances, the economic benefits of volunteer services will be\nconsumed as the services are acquired. In some cases, the volunteer services will contribute to the\ndevelopment of an asset and be included in the carrying amount of that asset.  \nB8 Entities may be recipients of volunteer services under voluntary or compulsory schemes operated in the\npublic interest, for example:  \n(a) technical assistance from other governments or international organisations;  \n(b) persons convicted of offences who are required to perform community service for the entity;  \n(c) hospitals receiving the services of volunteers;  \n(d) schools receiving voluntary services from parents as teachers\u2019 aides or as board members; and  \n(e) local governments receiving the services of volunteer firefighters.  \nB9 Entities may also be recipients of volunteer professional services that support their broader activities. For\nexample, charities and religious organisations may receive free professional accounting or legal services.  \nB10 Government appropriations, which establish the authority to spend money for particular purposes, are a\nform of a transfer made voluntarily as the government is not compelled to make particular payments of\namounts appropriated.  \nB11 Taxes, rates and fines are forms of transfers made compulsorily.",

In such\ncases, liabilities recognised in accordance with other Standards do not include refund obligations that apply\nin the event of a breach, unless the breach has occurred or is expected to occur. For example, a grant\nagreement may require the funds provided to an entity to be spent only in a particular period, failing which\nrepayment to the grantor will be required. As the entity has the discretion whether to spend funds received\nin advance of the specified period, a refund liability is not recognised unless the entity breaches the\ncondition or a breach is expected.  \n**Transfers to enable an entity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-**\n**financial asset to be controlled by the entity**  \nB15 An entity that receives a financial asset, such as cash, in a transfer to enable the entity to acquire or\nconstruct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the entity shall apply the requirements of\nAASB 9 to that financial asset. The acquisition or construction of the non-financial asset is accounted for\nseparately to the transfer of the financial asset, in accordance with other Standards. If the non-financial\nasset is not permitted to be recognised by another Standard (eg knowledge or intellectual property\ndeveloped through research, which cannot be recognised as an asset in accordance with AASB 138),\nparagraphs 15\u201317 do not apply. The key criterion is that the recognisable non-financial asset will be under\nthe control of the entity (ie for its own use) \u2013 it will not be transferred to the transferor or other parties.\nTherefore, the transfer of the financial asset (or the relevant part) to the entity does not occur under a\ncontract with a customer and is not subject to AASB 15. However, the recognisable non-financial asset\ncould increase the entity\u2019s ability or capacity to provide goods or services to other parties pursuant to other\ntransactions, which are separate to the transfer that enabled the entity to acquire or construct the nonfinancial asset for its own use.  \nB16 On initial recognition of the financial asset, the entity recognises the requirement to acquire or construct the\nrecognisable non-financial asset as an obligation and considers whether there are other conditions that give\nrise to performance obligations that require the entity to transfer goods or services to other entities (which\nare accounted for under AASB 15). The obligation to acquire or construct the non-financial asset is\naccounted for similarly to a performance obligation under AASB 15. For each obligation, the entity shall\ndetermine whether the obligation would be satisfied over time or at a point in time. If an entity does not\nsatisfy an obligation over time, the obligation would be satisfied at a point in time.  \nB17 An entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each obligation satisfied over time and the\nentity shall apply that method consistently to similar obligations and in similar circumstances. At the end of\neach reporting period, an entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of each\nobligation that is satisfied over time, and shall recognise income over time on that basis.",

When applying that paragraph, an entity\nconsiders whether a provision should be recognised in accordance with AASB 137 for a constructive\nobligation.  \nB22 Critical to recognising a provision for a constructive obligation, an entity must demonstrate that its\npublished policies, past practices or current statements are sufficiently specific to raise a valid expectation\non the part of other parties that the entity will discharge its responsibilities under those policies, practices or\nstatements. Determining whether an entity\u2019s policies, practices or statements are sufficiently specific to\ncreate such an expectation among other parties is a matter of judgement. However, it is unlikely that an\nentity\u2019s charter or stated objectives would satisfy the definition of a constructive obligation.  \nB23 An established pattern of past practices might also create a valid expectation among other parties that the\nentity will continue to adhere to those practices in the future. While entities might establish a general\npattern for utilising assets received, they often do not adhere to those patterns to such a degree as to create a\nvalid expectation among other parties.  \n_Legal obligations_  \nB24 Contractual terms (implicit or explicit), legislation or another operation of the law might create a legal nonfinancial obligation for an entity. In these circumstances an entity applies AASB 137 to recognise a\nprovision, if any, arising from those legal obligations.  \nB25 Provisions might arise from terms included in a lease, such as an obligation to return or restore the leased\nasset in its original condition. Paragraphs 24 and 25 of AASB 16 provide guidance on accounting for an\nobligation to maintain, or restore, assets to conditions specified in a lease. Where such an obligation exists,\nthe obligation is also accounted for in accordance with AASB 137.",

This is because the entity\ndoes not promise to provide goods or services in an agreement that creates obligations enforceable against\nthe entity by legal or equivalent means.  \nB29 Taxes, rates and fines are not contributions by owners acting in their capacity as owners.  \n-----  _Payable tax credits and other tax relief_  \nB30 Amounts of _tax relief that enter directly into the calculation of a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability (including tax_\nallowances, exemptions and deductions, and \u2018non-payable tax credits\u2019) are treated as reductions in income\n(ie foregone income), rather than expenses. A \u2018non-payable tax credit\u2019 is a tax credit limited to the amount\nof the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability for the period. An example of tax relief that enters directly into the calculation\nof a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability is where taxpayers are permitted tax deductions for self-education expenses.\nThese types of concessions are available only to taxpayers. If an entity (including a natural person) does\nnot pay tax, it cannot access the concession.  \nB31 In contrast, a payable tax credit is a tax credit that is not limited to the amount of the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability\nfor the period; that is, any excess of the tax credit over the tax liability for the period would be payable to\nthe taxpayer. Such tax credits might be payable to taxpayers as part of a programme in which the same\namount of benefit is paid to taxpayers and non-taxpayers alike (the latter being payable exclusively in the\nform of a cash benefit). For example, a government may use the tax system as a convenient method of\npaying benefits to taxpayers, which would otherwise be paid using another payment method, such as\nwriting a cheque, directly depositing the amount in a taxpayer\u2019s bank account, or settling another account\non behalf of the taxpayer. For example, a government may pay part of an individual\u2019s health insurance\npremiums, to encourage the uptake of such insurance, either by reducing the individual\u2019s tax liability (by\nproviding payable tax credits), making a payment by cheque or by paying an amount directly to the insurer.\nIn these cases, the amount is payable irrespective of whether the individual pays taxes. Consequently, this\namount is an expense of the government and is recognised separately from its tax income. Tax income is\nmeasured gross of any expenses incurred by granting payable tax credits.",

Rate payments received before the annual rateable period begins\nare fully refundable up to the beginning of the rateable period for which the payment is made. For example,\nif the Council receives a payment in May 20X6 for the rateable period from 1 July 20X6 to 30 June 20X7,\nthe receipt is refundable in May and June 20X6.  \nThe following transactions have occurred during May and June 20X6, in aggregate:  \nratepayers prepaid 20X6/X7 rates of $120,000; and  \nrefunds of prepaid rates totalling $7,000 were paid to ratepayers.  \nOn receipt of prepaid rates, the Council determines that it has acquired cash (a financial asset) for no\nconsideration to further the objectives of the Council.

The\nlease contract specifies lease payments of $100 per annum. At the inception of the lease, the entity assesses\nthe terms and conditions of the lease, including restrictions, and determines the fair value of the right to use\nthe facility for 30 years is $360,000. The leased premises must be used to provide services to the homeless,\nor else Charity A will no longer be able to use the facility.  \nThere are no other conditions specified in the lease contract.  \nScope and asset recognition  \nCharity A determines:  \nthe $360,000 right-of-use asset is an asset the charity acquired for consideration significantly below\nfair value to further the objectives of the charity. Accordingly, the asset is within the scope of\nAASB 1058; and  \nit controls a leased asset ($360,000) within the scope of AASB 16.  \nOn recognition of the right-of-use asset, Charity A determines the lease does not give rise to related\namounts of the following types:  \na contribution by owners, as the local government does not have an ownership interest in Charity A;  \na contract with a customer in accordance with AASB 15, because the lease liability arises from a lease\ncontract within the scope of AASB 16 and there are no other sufficiently specific performance\nobligations requiring transfers of goods or services to the local government or others associated with\nthe lease contracts.

To be in the scope of AASB 15, the contract must:  \n(a) be enforceable;  \n(b) contain performance obligations to transfers goods or services to another party that are\nsufficiently specific to enable determination of when the obligation has been satisfied; and  \n(c) not result in the goods or services specified being retained by the entity, ie the goods or services\nwill be transferred to the customer or to other parties on behalf of the customer.  \n**Example 6\u2014Enforceable agreement, performance obligations and restrictions on timing of**\n**expenditure**  \nCharity B receives a government grant of $2.4 million on 31 May 20X6, which is refundable if the money is\nnot spent in the period 1 July 20X6 to 30 June 20X7.  \nScope and asset recognition  \nCharity B determines:  \nthe $2.4 million grant is an asset the charity acquired to further the objectives of the charity; and  \nit controls a financial asset ($2.4 million cash) within the scope of AASB 9.  \nThe above fact pattern and analysis applies to Examples 6A and 6B, described below.  \n**Example 6A \u2013 Enforceable agreement, no specific performance obligations but restrictions on timing**\n**of expenditure**  \nThis example contains the additional fact that Charity B\u2019s agreement with the grantor specifies that the\ngrant must be used in accordance with the charity\u2019s overall objectives. The agreement does not specify the\nservices that the grant must be used for.  \nCharity B analyses the terms of the grant agreement and notes:  \nthe agreement is enforceable as the grantor can enforce its rights in the contract to require Charity B to\nreturn the cash of $2.4 million if Charity B does not spend the amount in the year ending 30 June\n20X7;  \nthe required use of the funds to further the entity's objectives is not sufficiently specific to know when\ngoods or services have been transferred and the obligation satisfied; and  \nthe time restriction on use of the funds is not sufficiently specific of itself to create a performance\nobligation to transfer goods or services to the grantor or a third party so that it can be identified when\nthe obligation is satisfied. When funds have been commingled with other funds, such as general\npurpose funds, used to fund administrative services as well as those related to the objectives of the\nentity, it is not possible to reliably determine what transfer of goods or services may have occurred\nusing the specific funds. The time restriction is also not sufficiently specific of itself to create a\nconstructive obligation.  \nConsequently, Charity B concludes that the transaction is not a contract with a customer as defined under\nAASB 15. Because the $2.4 million grant is an asset the charity acquired for no consideration to further its\nobjectives, the grant is within the scope of AASB 1058.  \nAccounting treatment  \nCharity B determines that there are no related amounts to recognise in accordance with paragraph 9.\nTherefore, Charity B recognises income of $2.4 million in accordance with paragraph 10 of AASB 1058 on\n31 May 20X6 on recognition of the financial asset in accordance with AASB 9.  \nFurthermore, on 31 May 20X6, Charity B does not have a liability under AASB 9 for the potential breach of\ncontract, as it has the discretion not to spend the grant money before 1 July 20X6. If Charity B breaches the\ncontract by spending the money before 1 July 20X6 or failing to spend the grant in full by 30 June 20X7,\nthe breach is the obligating event giving rise to a liability (in this instance, a penalty). For this reason,\nCharity B recognises the grant of $2.4 million as income as at 31 May 20X6. If Charity B breaches the\ncontract, it recognises a liability and equivalent expense for the amount due for repayment when the breach\noccurs.  \n-----  The journal entry for the accounting treatment is:  \n**31 May 20X6** **Debit** **Credit**  \nCash 2,400,000  \nIncome 2,400,000  \n**Example 6B \u2013 Enforceable agreement, sufficiently specific performance obligations and restrictions**\n**on timing of expenditure**  \nThis example contains the following additional facts relating to Charity B:  \nCharity B\u2019s charter states its purpose is to provide counselling to victims of violence and emergency\naccommodation to the homeless; and  \nCharity B has an agreement with the grantor that specifies the grant must be spent providing crisis\ncounselling services for a given number of hours per week for the entire year ending 30 June 20X7.\nCharity B expects to fulfil its promise to provide the counselling services.  \nBased on the facts and circumstances outlined above, on gaining control of the grant of $2.4 million,\nCharity B determines that the grant agreement does not give rise to related amounts of the following types:  \na contribution by owners, as the government does not have an ownership interest in Charity B;  \na lease liability as defined in AASB 16, as the grant agreement is not a lease and does not contain a\nlease;  \na financial liability within the scope of AASB 9, as there is no unconditional obligation to repay the\ngrant and the conditions requiring repayment of the grant are under the control of Charity B; and  \na provision within the scope of AASB 137, as the agreement provides legal obligations and there are no\nother sufficiently specific constructive obligations to consider.  \nCharity B concludes its agreement with the grantor is a contract with a customer as defined in AASB 15.\nThis is on the basis that:  \nthe agreement is enforceable (refer to paragraphs F11\u2013F19 of AASB 15), as the grantor can enforce its\nrights in the contract to require Charity B to return the funds if Charity B does not fulfil the specific\nperformance obligations under the contract (ie by providing the counselling services for the specified\nnumber of hours per week for the entire year); and  \nCharity B\u2019s obligation to provide the specific services (identified counselling services for a specific\nnumber of hours per week in 20X6/X7 to victims of violence) in return for the consideration from the\ngrantor is sufficiently specific to determine when the obligation is satisfied, as it will be clear at the end\nof each week whether the specified hours of counselling have been provided (refer to paragraph F20 of\nAASB 15). The services are also provided to third parties and not consumed by Charity B.  \nAccounting treatment  \nIn accordance with paragraph 9, the related amount for the $2.4 million is accounted for by Charity B as a\ncontract liability in accordance with AASB 15 on recognition of the financial asset in accordance with\nAASB 9.  \nThe journal entry for the initial recognition is:  \n**31 May 20X6** **Debit** **Credit**  \nCash 2,400,000  \nContract liability 2,400,000",

The ELC\nwas completed on 30 June 20X3 and the $2 million was fully spent.  \nScope and asset recognition  \nSchool A determines:  \nthe $2 million grant is an asset the school acquired for consideration that is significantly less than the\nfair value of the grant to further the objectives of the school. Accordingly, the grant is within the scope\nof AASB 1058; and  \nit controls a financial asset ($2 million) within the scope of AASB 9.  \nSchool A determines its agreement with the State Government is a transfer of a financial asset to enable it to\nconstruct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the school that meets the criteria in\nparagraph 15 of AASB 1058.

The grant to construct an asset to be\ncontrolled by School A does not require a sufficiently specific transfer of goods or services to the\ngrantor or another party (see paragraph F20 of AASB 15) and the requirement to continue using the\nschool for EL programs is not sufficiently specific to know when the service has been provided. This\nis because it is not possible to know at the time an EL program is delivered whether it is a program that\nsatisfies requirements of the grant;  \na lease liability as defined in AASB 16, as the agreement does not provide a right to use a specified\nasset;  \na financial liability within the scope of AASB 9, as there is no obligation to provide cash or another\nfinancial asset to other parties; and  \na provision within the scope of AASB 137, as the agreement specifies legal obligations and there are\nno other sufficiently specific constructive obligations to consider.  \nAccounting treatment  \nIn accordance with paragraph 16 of AASB 1058, School A:  \nidentifies each obligation relating to the receipt of the cash grant and allocates the entire grant\n($2 million) to those obligations \u2013 the work to be undertaken to construct the ELC;  \nrecognises a liability for its obligation under the agreement; and  \nrecognises income as it satisfies its obligation to construct the school.  \nIn accordance with paragraph 16 of AASB 1058, income is recognised over time as the building is\nconstructed.  \nThe journal entries for the accounting treatment are:  \n_Initial recognition_ **Debit** **Credit**  \n**1 July 20X1**  \nCash 2,000,000  \nObligation 2,000,000  \n_Year 1_  \n**30 June 20X2**  \nObligation 1,200,000  \nIncome 1,200,000  \n-----  ",

This will develop the\nintellectual property of the institute.  \nThe terms of the agreement require Institute N to:  \ndevelop its existing prediction models with the aim of improving the accuracy of six-month and\ntwelve-month forecasts;  \nprovide semi-annual budget reports that detail how the funds have been spent; and  \nreturn any funds that remain unspent after eighteen months.  \nScope and asset recognition  \nResearch Institute N determines:  \nthe agreement is enforceable as grant funds are refundable if the research is not undertaken or the funds\nare not fully expended under the project;  \nthe agreement is not a contract with a customer as defined in AASB 15 since no transfer of goods or\nservices to the Government or other parties is required;  \nthe $170,000 grant is an asset acquired by Institute N for consideration that is significantly less than the\nfair value of the grant to further the objectives of the institute. Accordingly, the grant is within the\nscope of AASB 1058; and  \nit controls a financial asset ($170,000) within the scope of AASB 9.  \nInstitute N determines its agreement with the State Government is a transfer of a financial asset to enable it\nto acquire a non-financial asset (intellectual property) to be controlled by the institute. However, the\ninstitute concludes that the agreement does not meet the criteria in paragraph 15 of AASB 1058, since the\nnon-financial asset cannot be recognised under other Standards: AASB 138 does not permit the recognition\nof research as an asset. Accordingly, the institute is not able to apply paragraph 16 to recognise a liability in\nrelation to the obligation under the agreement to develop the non-financial asset.  \nInstitute N therefore applies paragraph 9 and determines that it does not need to recognise related amounts\nof the following types:  \na contribution by owners, as the grantor does not control or have an ownership interest in Institute N;  \na contract with a customer within the scope of AASB 15 (as noted above);  \na lease liability as defined in AASB 16, as the agreement does not provide a right to use a specified\nasset;  \na financial liability within the scope of AASB 9, as there is no obligation to provide cash or another\nfinancial asset to other parties; and  \na provision within the scope of AASB 137, as the agreement does not set out any constructive\nobligations \u2013 the refund obligation is recognised only in the event of a breach of the agreement or when\na breach is expected.  \n-----  Accounting treatment  \nIn accordance with paragraph 10 of AASB 1058, Institute N recognises the grant as income when it obtains\ncontrol of the funds.  \nThe journal entry for the initial recognition is:",

        "page_content=": "## The need for change  \nBC2 Prior to the issue of this Standard and AASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the recognition_  \nand measurement requirements for transactions giving rise to income depended on whether the transaction\nwas reciprocal or non-reciprocal in nature. The accounting for income arising from reciprocal transactions\nwas predominantly addressed in AASB 118 _Revenue_ and AASB 111 _Construction Contracts. The_\naccounting for income arising from non-reciprocal transactions was addressed in AASB 1004 Contributions.  \nBC3 The Board observed determining whether a transaction was reciprocal or non-reciprocal in practice was not  \nalways straightforward. Entities found it challenging to determine whether approximately equal value had\nbeen provided in exchange to the other party or parties to the transfer, and contended that in many instances\nthe immediate recognition of income in a non-reciprocal transaction did not faithfully represent the\nunderlying financial performance of the entity. Diverse interpretations existed, with some entities\nrecognising transactions with return obligations and specified performance outcomes as reciprocal\ntransactions and some not.  \nBC4 Constituents were particularly concerned about the income recognition requirements as applied to grants,  \nappropriations and other transfers of assets made on the condition that the not-for-profit entity deliver goods\nor services to nominated third parties. The Board heard that constituents who are preparers find it difficult\nto discuss financial information with grantors and donors, and challenging to explain why a not-for-profit\nentity needed additional resources when the financial statements indicated no such need. Users noted they\ndid not think the financial statements were reflective of the economic reality of a not-for-profit entity\u2019s\nfinancial circumstances.  Having regard to the feedback from constituents, the Board decided to undertake a\nproject to conduct a fundamental review of the income recognition requirements applying to not-for-profit\nentities.  \nBC5 The Board observed that the International Accounting Standards Board had completed developments in the  \naccounting for revenue with the issue of IFRS 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ in May 2014.\nThe Board noted it still needed to determine what, if any, amendments and guidance would be required to\nenable not-for-profit entities to apply the equivalent Australian Accounting Standard, AASB 15. In\naddition, the Board noted that the application of the performance obligation approach to revenue recognition\nadopted in AASB 15, using a broader concept of customer, had the potential to resolve some of the issues\nnoted with AASB 1004. Consequently, the Board considered that this was an appropriate time to undertake\na project to review the income recognition requirements applying to not-for-profit entities.  \nBC6 As part of its current project, the Board noted there is currently divergence in practice in the accounting for  \nleases with significantly below-market terms and conditions, such as \u2018peppercorn\u2019 leases where a nominal\namount is made as payment to the lessor. Some entities consider AASB 117 Leases takes precedence over\nAASB 1004 and accordingly, currently recognise such leases at nominal values; others consider the reverse\napplies and recognise such leases at fair value, together with a related contribution. The Board decided its\nproject should also clarify the accounting for such leases.  \nBC7 The Board also observed that various Australian Accounting Standards required a not-for-profit entity to  \nrecognise assets received at fair value (or current replacement cost, in relation to inventories) only where the\nasset had been acquired for no or nominal consideration (for example, AASB 116 _Property, Plant and_\n_Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets). The Board perceived there to be a gap in the accounting for_\nthose transactions where an asset has been acquired for consideration that is below market but is more than\nnominal. The Board noted that under existing recognition and measurement rules at that time, an entity\nwould likely not have recognised any income on the transaction, but measured the asset acquired at the\namount of the consideration transferred. The Board considered that, in many instances, such transactions\nwere unlikely to be conceptually different to those for which no consideration was transferred, and\nconsequently decided to also consider the accounting for such transactions as part of this project.  \n-----  ",

The last such Exposure Draft, ED 180, was closely based on IPSAS 23 Income from Non-exchange\n_Transactions (Taxes and Transfers). At that time, the Board decided, having regard to feedback received on_\nthe ED and the progress the IASB was making on a project to replace IAS 18 _Revenue, not to finalise the_\nproposals set out in ED 180, but instead to refocus its project following issue of IFRS 15 _Revenue from_\n_Contracts with Customers._",

        "page_content=": "### Using the IPSAS 23 exchange/ non-exchange approach\nBC12 Unlike the income recognition requirements in AASB 1004, IPSAS 23 requires liabilities to be recognised in  \nrelation to non-exchange transactions when transferred assets are received on the condition that the recipient\nentity must:  \n(a) consume the future economic benefits embodied in the transferred assets as specified; or if not,  \n(b) return the future economic benefits to the transferor.  \nBC13 The Board observed that it had previously considered adopting an approach similar to that used in IPSAS,  \nand exposed this for comment as part of ED 180. However, the Board had received constituent feedback\nthat the:  \n(a) definition of a \u2018non-exchange transaction\u2019 in IPSAS (a transaction in which \u201can entity either  \nreceives value from another entity without directly giving approximately equal value in exchange,\nor gives value to another entity without directly receiving equal value in exchange\u201d) was similar\nto the non-reciprocal definition and therefore would still be ambiguous and difficult to apply in\npractice; and  \n(b) the notion of a liability in ED 180 was too narrow.  \nBC14 Having regard to the above, the Board decided not to develop proposals based on IPSAS in this project for  \nthe following reasons (see also paragraphs BC177\u2013BC179):  \n(a) IPSAS employs an exchange/non-exchange distinction to determine the accounting for income;  \nwith non-exchange being defined similarly to non-reciprocal in Australian Accounting Standards.\nThe Board observed that part of the reason for undertaking this project was in response to\nconstituent feedback of challenges in identifying a transaction as a reciprocal/non-reciprocal\ntransaction, and concerns that the consequential accounting did not reflect the true underlying  \n-----  financial performance of the entity. Accordingly, the Board considered that basing its project\nproposals on existing IPSAS would not meet its objective in undertaking this project; and  \n(b) the IPSASB is currently developing new standards-level requirements and guidance on revenue to  \namend or supersede that currently in IPSAS. As part of that project, the IPSASB is expected to\nhave regard to the requirements set out in IFRS 15. The IPSASB is not expected to complete its\nproject before 2019. Having regard to the effective date of AASB 15, the Board considered that it\nis necessary for it to develop guidance at this time to assist not-for-profit entities in implementing\nAASB 15 in advance of the IPSASB project.",

        "page_content=": "### Extending the scope of AASB 120\nBC15 As part of its deliberations about an appropriate approach, the Board observed that extending the scope of  \nAASB 120 to not-for-profit entities would allow government grants to be accounted for under a strict\ntransaction-neutral approach. However, the Board was reluctant to do so, given the:  \n(a) limited scope of transfers addressed by AASB 120 compared to the varied transfers received by a  \nnot-for-profit entity; and  \n(b) application of the recognition and presentation requirements in that Standard could result in an  \nentity\u2019s assets being materially understated. For example:  \n(i) government grants of non-monetary assets may be measured at a nominal amount;  \n(ii) government grants relating to assets may be deducted in determining the carrying\namount of the assets; and  \n(iii) grants are not to be recognised by an entity until there is reasonable assurance that the\nentity will comply with the conditions attaching to the grants and the grants will be\nreceived (however, conditions attaching to grants are relevant to whether liabilities\nexist, not to whether assets have been received).  \nBC16 The Board observed that extending the application of requirements in AASB 120 to all transfers of a not-for\nprofit entity would require a not-for-profit entity to defer income recognition for every form of transfer until\nthere is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with any conditions attached to the transfer.\nAASB 120 does not define \u2018conditions\u2019, and consequently, the Board was concerned there would be\ninconsistency in application of the requirements. For example, whether conditions include only performance\nconditions (as used in the IFRS for SMEs), akin to performance obligations of the form specified by\nAASB 15, or whether conditions include other conditions. The Board also considered it unclear whether the\n\u2018conditions\u2019 of some transfers, for example, an endowment that must be used to provide an annual\nscholarship, could ever be said to be met. Accordingly, the Board was not convinced that developing\nproposals based on AASB 120 would achieve its objectives in undertaking this project.  \nBC17 In addition, the Board discussed recent international developments for the recognition of income, and noted  \nAASB 120 was less consistent with current conceptual thinking (compared to AASB 15) as it does not\narticulate the nature of obligations giving rise to a liability rather than income, or when these obligations can\nbe said to have been satisfied. The Board observed that the principles in IAS 20 Accounting for Government\n_Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance_ had not been reconsidered fully at the time of issue of\nIFRS 15. However, the IASB considered the approach in IAS 20 when developing the _IFRS for SMEs_\nStandard. The IASB ultimately decided to adopt an approach that refers to the recognition of income when\nperformance conditions are satisfied. This approach may be considered to be similar to the IFRS 15\nperformance obligation approach. Further, the Board observed that the IASB has no current plans to review\nIAS 20. Having regard to the significance of grants, taxes, donations and similar transfers to the income of a\nnot-for-profit entity, the Board decided to confirm again its 2004 decision not to extend AASB 120 to apply\nalso to not-for-profit entities.",

        "page_content=": "### Based on AASB 15\nBC18 The Board issued AASB 15 in December 2014, incorporating IFRS 15 _Revenue from Contracts with_  \n_Customers, and superseding AASB 118 and AASB 111 (among other pronouncements). The AASB 15_\nrevenue recognition model replaced the risk and rewards approach of AASB 118, introducing a performance\nobligation approach to the recognition of revenue. The five-step model in AASB 15 focuses on:  \n(a) identifying the contract;  \n(b) identifying performance obligations;  \n(c) determining the transaction price;  \n(d) allocating the transaction price; and  \n-----  (e) recognising revenue.  \nBC19 In the process of issuing AASB 15, the AASB decided that, consistent with AASB 118, AASB 15 should  \napply to not-for-profit entities as well as for-profit entities. In this project, the AASB considered whether\nincome from non-reciprocal transfers should continue to be treated differently from revenue from reciprocal\ntransfers. The Board concluded that, for any entity, a performance obligation (that is, a promise to transfer a\ngood or a service to a customer in a contract) gives rise to a contract liability when the customer pays\nconsideration for the good or service. Consequently, the Board decided that the principles in AASB 15 on\nperformance obligations should apply to any entity, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, in the private sector\nor public sector.  \nBC20 Overall, the Board considered the financial reporting of not-for-profit entities would be best improved by, as  \na starting point, aligning the applicable recognition and measurement principles with the principles of\nAASB 15, and drawing on the guidance available in IPSAS where not inconsistent with Australian\nAccounting Standards. This is in keeping with the Board\u2019s policy on transaction neutrality.",

        "page_content=": "## Issue of ED 260  \nBC21 The Board\u2019s proposals with respect to the accounting for income of not-for-profit entities finalised in this  \nStandard were exposed for public comment in April 2015 as part of ED 260 _Income of Not-for-Profit_\n_Entities. In developing ED 260, the Board considered both the feedback received on ED 180 and the_\nrequirements of AASB 15. ED 260 proposed both revisions to the income recognition principles in\nAASB 1004, and development of guidance and illustrative examples to assist not-for-profit entities in\nimplementing AASB 15.  \nBC22 Part B of ED 260 proposed the issue of a draft Standard establishing the principles that a not-for-profit entity  \nshall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature and amount of\nassets, liabilities, income and cash flows arising from inflows (or net inflows) of resources from donations,\ngrants, taxes, and similar transactions and events. The ED proposed that income is immediately recognised\nfor the excess of an asset acquired over any related liabilities or contributions by owners. Related liabilities\ninclude contract liabilities arising in a contract with a customer within the scope of AASB 15.  \nBC23 In June 2015, the Board held roundtables in Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Sydney to seek feedback on  \nits proposals set out in ED 260. The ED proposals were also presented at various forums, workshops and\ndiscussion groups. In addition, the Board conducted targeted meetings to help ensure the Board understood\nthe implications of its proposals to entities with different not-for-profit objectives (for example, charities and\nlocal governments).  \nBC24 The Board received feedback on its proposals through receipt of 34 formal comment letters on ED 260. The  \nBoard also obtained feedback via means such as email, meetings with constituents, presentations to various\nbodies and social media. About half the respondents to the Exposure Draft explicitly considered that\noverall, the proposals would result in financial statements that would be useful to users. Many respondents\nto ED 260 expressed support for no longer basing income recognition requirements on a reciprocal/nonreciprocal transfer distinction as previously specified by AASB 1004, but on requirements based on\nsatisfying a performance obligation.  \nBC25 Many respondents to ED 260 qualified their support that a resulting Standard would result in financial  \nstatements that would be useful to users. The main concerns raised about the proposals were:  \n(a) the proposals would not fully resolve the current dissatisfaction with existing income recognition  \nrequirements as entities would not be able to fully defer income recognition to such time as related\nexpenses are recognised. The Board noted that responding fully to such concerns would result in\nliabilities being recognised inconsistent with the Framework _for the Preparation and Presentation_\n_of Financial Statements_ and that with no conceptual basis it would be difficult to distinguish\nwhich receipts should be deferred and which should not. In response, the Board decided to add\ndisclosure encouraging entities to disclose information in the financial statements (including on\nthe face of the financial statements) of externally imposed restrictions on an entity. The Board\nconsidered this would go some way to addressing constituent concerns that financial performance\nis misrepresented to users as it allows preparers to better explain their financial performance to\nothers;  \n(b) the proposals were presented in an overly complicated manner, and consequently the interaction  \nwith other Australian Accounting Standards was not necessarily clear. In response, the Board\ndecided to redraft the pronouncements to clarify the specified requirements when finalising this\nStandard (and AASB 2016-8), and to add further illustrative examples to illustrate the operation of\nthe Standard, including its interaction with AASB 15 and other Australian Accounting Standards.\nAs part of this, the Board decided that this Standard should not address the recognition of assets  \n-----  that are already the subject of existing Australian Accounting Standards (see paragraphs BC58\u2013\nBC59).  \nBC26 Given the significance of this project to not-for-profit entities, the Board decided to establish a Project  \nAdvisory Panel consisting of preparers and advisors. The Panel provided valuable insights to the AASB\nduring the Board\u2019s redeliberations of the ED, enabling the Board to make better informed decisions about\nwhether, and how, to finalise the proposals in ED 260.  \nBC27 In addition, the Board decided to invite public comment on draft pronouncements incorporating the Board\u2019s  \ndecisions following completion of its redeliberations. Draft Standards were issued in September 2016 for\npublic comment primarily seeking feedback on matters constituents considered to be a \u2018fatal flaw\u2019 with the\npronouncements. The Board received seven formal submissions, and also obtained feedback via various\npresentations and meetings held with other constituents and with Panel members.",

        "page_content=": "## Finalisation of ED 260  \nBC28 Following the consultation period, and after considering constituent comments received, the Board decided  \nto proceed with issuing revised principles for the recognition and measurement of income of not-for-profit\nentities largely as exposed. The Board considered the identified benefits of the revised requirements to\nexceed the costs of the revised requirements.  \nBC29 The Board observed some of the costs of the new requirements to be:  \n(a) costs of changing systems and processes to reflect the revised requirements;  \n(b) costs of reviewing the terms of existing contracts, funding agreements and similar to determine  \nthe impact on transition. The Board observed that it expects the operation of the transitional\nprovisions to largely negate these costs;  \n(c) increased costs associated with the requirement to measure more assets at fair value (or current  \nreplacement cost, in relation to inventories) at initial recognition. The Board observed that while\nthe consequential amendments made by this Standard will require more assets to be recognised\nand measured at fair value, these requirements better reflect the value transferred to the entity.\nThe Board noted this Standard does not require assets (including assets obtained in a \u2018peppercorn\u2019\nlease where a nominal amount is made as payment to the lessor) to be measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis, but only on initial recognition (or in some instances, on transition to this Standard).\nFurther, the Standard does not require the valuations to be conducted by a professional valuation\nexpert. In addition, the Board noted the Standard does not require assets in the form of donated\ninventory to be recognised and measured at current replacement cost where the item donated is\nnot material;  \n(d) increased costs associated with the requirement to separately identify components not related to a  \ntransfer of goods or services. In response, the Board has limited the instances in which an entity is\nrequired to separately account for such components in a contract with a customer, and only\nrequires the accounting to be applied where the component is material;  \n(e) increased costs associated with identifying whether transactions are contracts with customers  \nwithin the scope of AASB 15, or to be accounted for in accordance with this Standard. The Board\nnoted it had added further guidance on enforceability and further illustrative examples to the\nStandard to assist entities in understanding whether the accounting for income arising from an\narrangement was likely to be addressed by AASB 15 or by this Standard; and  \n(f) costs of educating users of the financial statements of the new approach.  \nBC30 The Board considered some of the benefits of the revised requirements to be:  \n(a) the approach adopted in AASB 1058 and AASB 15 (as amended by AASB 2016-8) best responds  \nto constituent concerns about the operation of the income recognition requirements formerly set\nout in AASB 1004, compared to the alternatives considered (see paragraphs BC10\u2013BC17 above);  \n(b) the Board\u2019s policy of transaction neutrality means that the application of AASB 15 to not-for\nprofit entities needed to be addressed at this time; however the concept of performance obligations\nin AASB 15 has enabled a fundamental change to income recognition for not-for-profit entities.\nThe performance obligation approach is more comprehensible than the reciprocal approach of\nAASB 1004;  \n(c) AASB 1058 and AASB 15 (as amended by AASB 2016-8) provide a better reflection of the  \nunderlying substance of transfers made to a not-for-profit entity recipient \u2013 under the revised\nprinciples, in general, income is deferred where an entity has a contractual obligation to deliver\nspecified goods or services;  \n-----  (d) there will be greater transparency of an entity\u2019s assets and liabilities which results in better  \naccountability and stewardship. Assets will be measured at fair value (or current replacement\ncost, in relation to inventories) at initial recognition where the asset has been acquired for\nconsideration that is significantly less than its fair value, or if no consideration was provided, and\nthe difference is principally to enable the entity to further its objectives. This helps address the\ncurrent ambiguity in accounting by a not-for-profit lessee for leases with significantly belowmarket lease payments and for other assets where the consideration is more than nil or nominal\namount but significantly less than the asset\u2019s fair value;  \n(e) while the principles in this Standard do not completely address constituent concerns about  \npotential misrepresentation of the not-for-profit entity\u2019s financial position and financial\nperformance to users, the Board has managed this through encouraging entities to disclose\ninformation distinguishing for users amounts that are restricted in their use (but which may have\nbeen recognised as income immediately in accordance with this Standard). The Board considered\nthat, as there is no contractual liability, the entity has the ability to use the assets acquired in\nalternative ways if that best reflects the needs of the entity, although the entity may currently have\nevery intention of continuing to use the assets acquired in a designated way;  \n(f) the revised principles are more conceptually consistent with the _Framework for the Preparation_  \n_and Presentation of Financial Statements as they require the recognition of a liability (a contract_\nliability in accordance with AASB 15 or obligation to construct an asset in accordance with this\nStandard) where an obligation exists.  \nBC31 The Board noted that while neither the underlying approach exposed nor the scope of the transactions the  \nproject was intended to address has changed between ED 260 and the final pronouncements, in response to\nthe feedback received, it had amended or clarified various proposals in ED 260, and finalised them in a form\ndifferent to that exposed. More significant changes from the ED include:  \n(a) asset recognition requirements to be specified only by other Australian Accounting Standards.  \nHowever, the Board observed this Standard makes consequential amendments to other Standards\nto extend the requirement to measure recognised assets at fair value (or current replacement cost,\nin relation to inventories) on initial recognition to a broader range of assets;  \n(b) AASB 1058 to specify requirements for an in-substance transfer of a non-financial asset to the  \nentity for its own use;  \n(c) additional disclosures;  \n(d) additional transitional provisions;  \n(e) additional guidance and illustrative examples; and  \n(f) deferral of the effective date.  \nBC32 The Board considered that, overall, its decisions on this project have not significantly departed from those  \nexposed in a manner that adversely affects entities applying the Standard. The Board decided to finalise its\nproposals exposed in ED 260 by:  \n(a) issuing AASB 1058 to address the accounting for income of not-for-profit entities.

Limiting the scope of AASB 1058 to revenue\ncould therefore omit requirements and guidance on potentially significant types of income of notfor-profit entities and only partially meet the objective of this project.  \nBC36 Accordingly, the Board based its proposals in ED 260 on the concept of income of an not-for-profit entity  \narising from inflows of resources because, in its view, revenue of not-for-profit entities did not capture all\ntransactions that the Board intended AASB 1058 to provide requirements for.

        "page_content=": "## Significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to further its objectives  \nBC39 Having regard to feedback received, in its redeliberations the Board decided to finalise these proposals, but  \nto shift the focus of AASB 1058 away from emphasising the identification of donations, grants and similar\ntransfers towards requiring an entity to identify whether an asset (other than volunteer services) was\nacquired for consideration that was significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to further\nits objectives. The Board considered this does not change the scope exposed in ED 260, but:  \n(a) avoids inadvertently limiting the extent of transactions that might give rise to income on initial  \nrecognition of an asset; and  \n-----  (b) gives entities a clear indication of the transactions that are captured within the scope of  \nAASB 1058;  \n(c) has the benefit of not requiring the entity to make an assessment of the transferor\u2019s intent; and  \n(d) continues to exclude acquisitions of assets at discounts attributable to auction, distress sale and  \ntrade discount pricings.  \nBC40 In developing its articulation of a revised scope for the Standard, the Board was conscious it did not intend  \nfor this Standard to apply to transactions such as trade discounts and distress sales, for which the\nconsideration paid for an asset may be significantly below the asset\u2019s fair value. The Board\u2019s view is that\nsuch discounts, where made available to all market participants (or a particular market segment) regardless\nof the participants\u2019 objectives, are not specific to the not-for-profit sector: other Australian Accounting\nStandards specify the accounting for such transactions.  \nBC41 The Board observed that \u2018significant\u2019 is a term used in other Standards, and considered its meaning therefore  \nwould be readily understandable by users of this Standard. The Board also noted that expressing the scope\nof AASB 1058 by reference to transactions \u201csignificantly less than fair value \u2026\u201d means that transactions\nwhere the consideration is only marginally less than fair value are not expressly covered. Therefore, such\ntransactions may be accounted for consistently with the requirements of AASB 1058 or with the accounting\napplicable to for-profit entities. Although this could mean less consistency in the accounting by not-forprofit entities for all asset transactions with consideration less than fair value, the Board regarded this\napproach as an appropriate balancing of the costs and benefits in accounting for transactions with\nconsideration that is less than fair value, but not significantly less than fair value.  \nBC42 Some respondents to ED 260 were concerned that the Standard would require the not-for-profit recipient to  \nmake an assessment of the transferor\u2019s intentions in undertaking a transaction with the entity. For this\nreason, in developing its articulation of a revised scope for AASB 1058, the Board wanted to avoid using\nlanguage that implied a need to assess the vendor\u2019s intentions. Accordingly, the Board decided to articulate\nin the scope that its interest is in transactions occurring principally to enable the entity to further its\nobjectives. The Board considered the term \u2018principally\u2019:  \n(a) provides a link between the significantly reduced purchase price (compared to fair value) and the  \npurpose of that reduction being to enable a not-for-profit entity to further its objectives;  \n(b) is more likely to be better understood as it is also currently used in Commonwealth grant  \napplications and in taxation law (for example, in relation to principal place of business); and  \n(c) is useful as there may be more than one reason for setting the terms and conditions of the  \ntransactions.  \nBC43 The Board considered using the term \u2018specifically\u2019 or \u2018particularly\u2019 in place of \u2018principally\u2019. However, the  \nBoard decided not to finalise the Standard using this language due to:  \n(a) the similarity of the term \u2018specifically\u2019 to \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 (as used in AASB 15); and  \n(b) concern that the term \u2018particularly\u2019 is too broad, and could give rise to differences in practice as to  \nwhether certain transactions are within the scope of this Standard.  \nBC44 This Standard makes consequential amendments to AASB 16 Leases to require a not-for-profit lessee to  \nmeasure the right-to-use asset in a lease at its fair value where the lease has been undertaken on significantly\nbelow-market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives. AASB 117 is\nsimilarly amended in respect of the leased asset recognised in a finance lease. The Board observed that the\nlease payments (the consideration) to acquire the asset in such transactions will be significantly less than the\nasset\u2019s fair value. Consequently, leases undertaken on significantly below-market terms and conditions\nprincipally to enable the entity to further its objectives are within the scope of AASB 1058.",

However, the Board decided to exclude AASB 2 _Share-based Payment_\nfrom this Standard for avoidance of doubt.  \nBC47 The Board also decided to exclude, from the scope of AASB 1058:  \n(a) licences outside the scope of AASB 15 (see paragraph BC48 below); and  \n(b) restructures of administrative arrangements within the scope of AASB 1004 _Contributions_ (see  \nparagraph BC49).  \nBC48 In its redeliberations on the ED, the Board discussed a concern that AASB 1058 would apply to a transfer of  \na licence to a not-for-profit entity, where that transaction is not within the scope of AASB 15. The Board\nheard that the accounting for licences in the public sector is a significant issue, and observed that the Board\nhad not before considered whether public sector licences should be accounted for in accordance with\nAASB 1058, or whether the licences are more appropriately accounted for by analogy to AASB 15. The\nBoard signalled its intention to undertake a separate project on the accounting for public sector licences, and\nas it did not want to presuppose the accounting outcomes of that project, decided to exclude licences that are\noutside the scope of AASB 15 from this Standard. The Board noted that not-for-profit entities with such\nlicences should develop an accounting policy in accordance with AASB 108, and that this policy could\nextend to applying the accounting set out in AASB 1058 by analogy.  \nBC49 The Board noted that the requirements of AASB 1058 could be interpreted to apply to restructures of  \nadministrative arrangements, which are addressed in AASB 1004 (see paragraph BC173 below).To avoid\nconfusion as to which Standard applies to these transactions, the Board decided to exclude them from the\nscope of AASB 1058.",

        "page_content=": "## Terminology  \nBC50 NFP entities might acquire, or obtain, an asset in a number of circumstances. Various terms are commonly  \nused to describe acquisitions of assets under terms and conditions that also provide a significant benefit to an\nentity, including \u2018grant\u2019, \u2018donation\u2019, \u2018bequest\u2019, \u2018assistance\u2019 and \u2018endowment\u2019.

        "page_content=": "## Measurement of assets  \nBC60 As noted in paragraph BC7, various Australian Accounting Standards presently require a not-for-profit  \nentity to recognise assets received at fair value (or current replacement cost, in relation to inventories) where\nthe asset had been acquired for no or nominal consideration. Part of the Board\u2019s reason for undertaking this\nproject was to address the perceived gap in the accounting for transactions where an asset has been acquired\nfor reduced consideration that is more than a nominal amount; the reduced consideration representing a\ndonation (or other transfer) to the entity to further its objectives.  \nBC61 The Board considered that, generally, assets and liabilities of not-for-profit entities arising from transactions  \nwithin the scope of a pronouncement resulting from this project should initially be measured in accordance\nwith the measurement requirements of any other Standard applying to that class of assets or liabilities (for\nexample, AASB 9, AASB 15 or AASB 116), because there is not a not-for-profit-entity-specific reason to\ndepart from those measurement requirements. However, the Board considered that, if a vendor, in a  \n-----  transaction in which a not-for-profit entity acquires an asset, or a lessor, in a finance lease entered by a notfor-profit entity, makes a donation in the sale or lease contract, the not-for-profit entity should measure the\ncost of the asset at fair value with a corresponding amount recognised as income (assuming there are no\nrelated amounts to recognise on the transaction in accordance with paragraph 9 of the Standard). The Board\nnoted that this view is consistent with the requirement in paragraph 66 of AASB 15 for an entity to measure\nany non-cash consideration at fair value to determine the transaction price in respect of a contract in which a\ncustomer promises consideration in a form other than cash.  \nBC62 The Board exposed this view as part of ED 260. The Board observed that this proposal was not limited to  \nacquisitions of assets at no cost or for nominal consideration. Consequently, in ED 260 the Board proposed:  \n(a) extending the scope of the corresponding requirements in AASB 102, AASB 116, AASB 138,  \nAASB 140 and AASB 141 that specify that the cost of an asset is measured at its fair value (or\ncurrent replacement cost, in relation to inventories) as at the date of acquisition if the asset was\nacquired at no cost or for nominal consideration;  \n(b) some finance lease assets of lessees would consequently be initially measured at fair value, rather  \nthan at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum\nlease payments (see AASB 117). The Board observed its proposed modification of the leasing\nrequirements in this regard would achieve consistency with the Standards referred to in\nparagraph BC62(a); and  \n(c) other assets recognised in accordance with Part B of ED 260 would also be required to be initially  \nrecognised at fair value.  \nBC63 The Board considered that the previous limitation on the use of fair value (or current replacement cost, in  \nrelation to inventories) to measure cost (ie when assets are acquired at no cost or for nominal consideration)\nwas too narrow, for the following reasons:  \n(a) significant donations made by vendors are not recognised when the consideration paid by the  \nentity is greater than nominal;  \n(b) as a consequence of (a), donations are treated inconsistently (for example, because a cash donation  \nis recognised but a donation in the form of a discount on an asset purchase is not); and  \n(c) the different treatment of donated assets, according to whether consideration is greater than  \n\u2018nominal\u2019, means that it is important to identify when consideration is \u2018nominal\u2019; however, that\nterm is undefined and its application may require subjective assessments.  \nBC64 Accordingly, the Board considered further modification of the asset measurement requirements set out in  \nAustralian Accounting Standards may be warranted. The Board proposed this modification in ED 260 as it\nconsidered the benefits of further modifying IFRS requirements in this regard to outweigh any additional\ncosts to a not-for-profit entity, having regard to the scale of such transactions in the not-for-profit sector and\nnoting that the modification would improve comparability by requiring consistent accounting for\ntransactions of the same nature. In its redeliberations, the Board confirmed its view in this regard and\ndecided to finalise its proposals largely as exposed, amended to reflect its revised articulation of the scope of\nthis Standard. However, in response to feedback about the undue complexity of a resulting pronouncement\nand to facilitate understanding of the interaction between AASB 1058 and other Standards, the Board\ndecided not to specify measurement requirements in respect of an asset (other than for volunteer services) in\nAASB 1058, but to reflect these within the specific other Australian Accounting Standards. Accordingly,\nthis Standard makes consequential amendments to AASB 16, AASB 102, AASB 116, AASB 117, AASB\n128, AASB 138, AASB 140 and AASB 141 to extend the requirement to measure assets at fair value (or\ncurrent replacement cost, in relation to inventories) to include all assets acquired where the consideration for\nthe asset is significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to further its objectives. The\nBoard observed that income may arise on the initial recognition of a broader set of assets under the revised\nrequirements set out in this Standard (including Appendix D) compared to the previous requirements.  \nBC65 The Board observed that under the revised requirements, a not-for-profit entity may be required to account  \nfor certain transactions made on significantly below-market terms and conditions differently to a for-profit\nentity. For example, a for-profit entity that negotiates a favourable price to acquire a property will initially\nmeasure that asset at the amount of consideration transferred. In contrast, a not-for-profit entity that\nnegotiates a similar favourable price to acquire property will initially measure that asset at the asset\u2019s fair\nvalue for transactions where that price was provided to the entity in support of the not-for-profit entity\u2019s\nobjectives, and the price is significantly different to the asset\u2019s fair value. The Board noted that this is not in\nkeeping with a strict transaction neutrality policy. However, the Board considered its revised requirements\nappropriately reflect the substance of the transaction between a vendor and a not-for-profit entity and that\nthe scale of such transactions in the not-for-profit sector is sufficiently greater than that in the for-profit\nsector to warrant the adoption of requirements for not-for-profit entities that differ from those for for-profit\nentities based on IFRS Standards.  \n-----  BC66 In keeping with its decision not to specify measurement requirements in respect of an asset that is already  \nthe subject of an existing Australian Accounting Standard, the Board decided not to finalise proposed\nguidance on the measurement of taxation income (and other non-contractual receivables arising from\nstatutory requirements) in AASB 1058, but as an amendment to AASB 9, made via AASB 2016-8.",

The subsequent measurement requirements for inventories held for distribution refer to current\nreplacement cost as one possible basis for identifying a loss in service potential.  \nBC68 The Board discussed a concern that it may be inappropriate to require all inventories acquired for  \nconsideration significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to further its objectives to be\ninitially measured at fair value. The Board observed that a day-one loss might arise in instances where\ncurrent replacement cost (subsequent measurement requirements) as defined in AASB 102 was determined\nto be less than the fair value on initial recognition of inventories held for distribution. Consequently, in\nfinalising this Standard, the Board decided to instead require inventories acquired for consideration\nsignificantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to further its objectives to be measured, on\ninitial recognition, at their current replacement cost, rather than at fair value as proposed. The Board\nconsidered this avoids inadvertently potentially creating new inventory measurement issues. The Board\ndecided to consider fair value measurement as part of a future project.",

The Board considered that until no other\nparty holds a right to challenge the Will, the entity does not have an enforceable right to receive the\nbequeathed items, and that it is likely that a not-for-profit entity does not gain control of the asset until such\ntime. Consistent with its decision to exclude asset recognition criteria from this Standard, the Board decided\nnot to include guidance on when an entity may gain control of a bequest.  \nBC70 In commenting on the Exposure Draft, respondents also expressed concerns about the accounting for  \nendowments made for the perpetual benefit of the entity. Respondents sought clarification of the accounting\nfor such endowments, including:  \n(a) the form, if any, of the asset controlled; and  \n(b) whether the endowment is a contract with customer within the scope of AASB 15, or is  \nrecognised as income immediately on obtaining control.  \nBC71 The Board decided there was no need to develop any new principles in relation to endowments. Also,  \nconsistent with its decision to exclude asset recognition criteria from this Standard, the Board decided not to\ninclude guidance on when an entity may gain control of an endowment. However, having regard to the\nconcerns raised by constituents, the Board decided to include illustrative examples to assist an entity in\nunderstanding whether a contract liability may need to be recognised on gaining control of an endowment.",

        "page_content=": "## Transactions including a contract with a customer  \nBC72 A customer may enter into a contract with a not-for-profit entity with a dual purpose of obtaining goods or  \nservices and to help the not-for-profit entity achieve its objectives. The Board considered that such a\ncontract should be separated into component parts to faithfully represent the impact of the transaction on the\nentity\u2019s financial performance.  \nBC73 The Board initially explored using a measurement-driven \u2018residual\u2019 approach to identify donation  \ncomponents of contracts with customers. Under this approach,  \n(a) performance obligations of a not-for-profit entity arising from a particular contract would be  \nmeasured at the stand-alone selling price for the unit of account for the usual sale of the promised\ngoods or services; and  \n-----  (b) the residual after deducting the measure of the performance obligations in (a) above from the total  \ncontract consideration (ie transaction price) would be recognised immediately as donation income.  \nBC74 The Board decided not to proceed with this approach having regard to:  \n(a) the risk of mistakenly identifying donation components in contracts with customers, because of  \nmeasurement error; and  \n(b) the time and cost of estimating the aggregate of the stand-alone selling prices of the promised  \ngoods or services separately from the transaction price would often exceed the benefits to users.  \nBC75 Consequently, in ED 260 the Board proposed that a not-for-profit entity be required to account for a  \nseparately identifiable donation component of a contract with a customer separately from the revenue that is\nrecognised when the entity transfers a good or service to the customer, where that donation component is\nmaterial. That is, the contract would be partly accounted for in accordance with this Standard (in respect of\nthe donation component), and partly in accordance with AASB 15 (in respect of any performance\nobligations).  \nBC76 The Board proposed that the identification of whether a contract with a customer includes a donation  \ncomponent to be accounted for separately requires a qualitative assessment of whether:  \n(a) the customer intended to make a donation to the entity; and, if so,  \n(b) the donation is separately identifiable from the goods or services promised in the contract. A  \ndonation is separately identifiable from the goods or services promised in the contract if:  \n(i) there is evidence that part of the consideration paid or payable by the customer is not\npart of the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the\npromised good or service;  \n(ii) the entity\u2019s entitlement to retain the donation is not conditional on that entity\ntransferring a good or service to the customer (donor); and  \n(iii) the amount of the donation component can be measured reliably.  \nBC77 Some respondents to ED 260 considered that accounting separately for donation components does not  \nprovide information sufficiently useful to justify the cost. However, the majority of respondents to ED 260\nagreed that any donation component included in a contract with a customer should be separated from the\ncontract and accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058. Some of these respondents did not support the\nproposed qualitative assessment of whether a donation component is separately identifiable (based, in part,\non whether the customer intended to make a donation). These constituents argued that it is unnecessary and\nunworkable to impose a \u2018customer intention\u2019 test for separately identifying a donation component.  \nBC78 In addition, the Board received feedback from its Project Advisory Panel that while understanding customer  \nrelationships was fundamental to the operation of AASB 15, the proposed approach to accounting for\ntransactions involving both a contract with a customer and a donation component was not intuitive. The\nBoard discussed feedback that the approach proposed in ED 260 overcomplicates the accounting, implies\nthat the not-for-profit entity needs to \u2018stand in the shoes\u2019 of the transferor, and prioritises non-refundability\nas a distinguishing factor.  \nBC79 In its redeliberations, having regard to the feedback received, the Board confirmed its decision that the  \nunderlying principle that applies is for each component of a transaction to be accounted for separately,\nwhere material. However, acknowledging the constituent concerns described above, the Board decided not\nto require income to be recognised in accordance with this Standard in every such situation.  \nBC80 Instead, the Board decided to develop a rebuttable presumption (set out in Appendix F to AASB 15) that the  \ntransaction price in a contract with a customer is treated as wholly related to the transfer of promised goods\nor services. The Board decided that this presumption should be rebutted where the transaction price is\npartially refundable in the event the entity does not deliver the promised goods or services. That is, for\ntransactions including a contract with a customer, only where these criteria are met may an entity have to\npossibly recognise an amount as income in accordance with paragraph 10 of this Standard. The Board\nconsidered whether the rebuttable presumption needed to also refer to separate identifiability of the element\nthat is not related to the transfer of promised goods or services. The Board decided that this was not\nnecessary, as this element \u2013 and any associated amount ascribed to it \u2013 represents the residual remaining\nafter allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in that contract. The Board\u2019s\nconsiderations in forming this decision are set out in its Basis for Conclusions to AASB 2016-8.  \nBC81 The rebuttable presumption is set out in Appendix F to AASB 15 (inserted via AASB 2016-8). However,  \nthe Board considered it important to highlight to users, as part of this Standard, that the requirements with\nrespect to the accounting for contracts with customers where the transaction price includes an amount that\nwould otherwise be separately recognised and accounted for as income immediately in accordance with this\nStandard is specified by AASB 15.  \n-----  ",

A residual amount would never arise and therefore no income\nwould be recognised in accordance with AASB 1058;  \n(b) the lease asset in a finance lease represents the right to use that asset for the lease term and  \ntherefore measuring it with respect to the leased property would not accurately reflect the\neconomic benefits arising from the lease; and  \n(c) the lease liability would not reflect an entity\u2019s ongoing obligations in respect of the lease if  \nmeasured with reference to the fair value of the leased property.  \nBC83 The Board agreed with constituent concerns, noting that it intended for the amendment to reflect the  \nobjective of AASB 1058. Consequently, the Board revised the amendment to require:  \n(a) the lease asset be measured with reference to the right to use the underlying asset in accordance  \nwith the terms and conditions of the lease;  \n(b) the lease liability be measured in accordance with the applicable Standard; and  \n(c) any residual amount be accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058.  \nBC84 The Board observed that AASB 16 _Leases would require amendment in addition to AASB 117. In this_  \nrespect the Board noted that AASB 16 measures the right-of-use asset with reference to the lease liability.\nThe Board noted that where an entity enters into a lease with below-market terms and conditions it is\nunlikely that the lease liability would reflect an appropriate starting point to measure the right-of-use asset\nand accurately reflect the substance of the lease transaction. Consequently, the Board decided to specify that\nthe right-of-use asset be initially measured at the fair value of the right to use the underlying asset in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the lease. This Standard does not require that right-of-use asset\nto be subsequently measured at fair value \u2013 the subsequent measurement requirements that apply are\nspecified by other Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC85 The Board noted that leases with below-market terms and conditions were of particular interest for  \nconstituents and therefore decided to specifically identify them in the examples of related financial statement\nelements that could arise from a transaction within the scope of AASB 1058.",

When developing the\nproposals for ED 260 the Board noted:  \n(a) paragraph 5.1.1 of AASB 9 requires a financial instrument to be initially measured at its fair  \nvalue; and  \n(b) paragraphs B5.1.1\u2013B5.1.2A of AASB 9 specify the accounting requirements in respect of any  \ndifference between the transaction price and the fair value of the instrument(s) transferred,\nincluding when any deferred difference is recognised as a gain or loss.  \nBC87 The Board discussed whether to require an element arising on transfer of a financial instrument (net transfer  \nof financial instruments) on terms significantly below fair value primarily to enable a not-for-profit entity to\nachieve its objectives to be accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058, or in accordance with paragraphs\nB5.1.1\u2013B5.1.2A of AASB 9.

When developing the proposals in ED 260, the Board noted that not-for-profit entities\ncould enter into arrangements that satisfy the criteria to recognise a provision. However, ED 260 did not\ncontain any further guidance on this point.  \nBC90 The Board observed that not-for-profit entities often provide specific reasons for their fundraising activities,  \nand that at times the purpose for fundraising could be very specific but not legally binding. The Board\ndiscussed when a not-for-profit entity may have a constructive obligation, in the absence of a legal\nobligation, on acquiring an asset in a transaction where consideration is significantly below fair value\nprincipally to further the entity\u2019s objectives, such that a related provision is recognised on initial recognition\nof the asset.  \nBC91 In its discussion, the Board had regard to paragraph 20 of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  \n_Contingent Assets, which states:_  \n\u201c\u2026 Because an obligation always involves a commitment to another party, it follows that a management or\nboard decisions does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the\ndecisions has been communicated before the end of the reporting period to those affected by it in a\nsufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will discharge its\nresponsibilities.\u201d  \nHence, the Board considered that it would be unlikely, for example, for a not-for-profit entity\u2019s charter or\nstated objectives to be a sufficiently specific statement creating a valid expectation on the part of other\nparties such that a provision should be recognised in accordance with AASB 137.  \nBC92 The Board decided it would be useful to set out its views in this regard in Appendix B of the Standard and  \nalso as part of the Illustrative Examples accompanying AASB 1058.",

The Board observed that\neach arrangement will need to be assessed based on its specific terms and conditions, and that judgement is\ninvolved in identifying whether an onerous contract which is part of the same economic event as the transfer\nfrom the grantor exists.

        "page_content=": "## Transfers for the purpose of enabling an entity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the entity  \nBC95 Some respondents to ED 260 sought clarification on whether a transfer made for the purposes of enabling an  \nentity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset for its own use would be recognised as\nincome immediately, or whether a contract liability determined in accordance with AASB 15 arises. The\nBoard noted that these concerns specifically related to whether a transfer of financial assets to enable an\nentity to acquire or construct a non-financial asset would result in a transfer of goods or services to the\ntransferor or another party. If such a transfer does not result in the transfer of goods or services to the\ntransferor or another party it will be outside the scope of AASB 15 and no contract liability is recognisable;\nand consequently, under the proposals, the transfer recognised as income on receipt.  \n-----  BC96 The Board heard feedback from constituents from the university sector that universities presently recognise  \na cash grant received to build an educational facility at the time of receiving the grant (that is, on gaining\ncontrol). Some constituents hold the view that this accounting treatment does not appropriately reflect the\nrelationship of the grant and its related expenditure as the related expenditure is recognised over a number of\nreporting periods as the educational facility is built.  \nBC97 The Board discussed whether such transfers were within the scope of AASB 15, as had been suggested by  \nED 260. The Board considered that in the absence of guidance, diverse practice may arise in this regard, for\nexample, some may consider that:  \n(a) the construction or acquisition of a recognisable non-financial asset on behalf of the grantor is an  \nactivity representing services being transferred to the grantor, similar to research activities\nundertaken on behalf of the grantor but benefiting the community at large. Under this view, an\nentity would conclude there had been a transfer of goods or services to the transferor or another\nparty;  \n(b) the construction or acquisition of the recognisable non-financial asset is not an activity  \nrepresenting services being transferred to the grantor as the asset remains with the not-for-profit\nentity. Under this view, an entity would conclude that the transfer is not a contract with a\ncustomer within the scope of AASB 15; and  \n(c) AASB 15 applies, but does not require any originally transferred cash and an associated contract  \nliability to be recognised. Instead, the underlying recognisable non-financial asset and income is\nrecognised as the asset is constructed, akin to treating the transaction as an in-substance transfer of\nthe underlying asset as consideration for the construction or acquisition service.  \nBC98 For avoidance of doubt, the Board decided to identify the accounting that applies to such transfers. In its  \nredeliberations, the Board observed that in such arrangements, in substance, the transferor had intended to\ntransfer a recognisable non-financial asset to the not-for-profit entity. The Board considered that an insubstance transfer of a good for use by the entity itself should not result in income until the recipient has\nsatisfied its obligation to construct or acquire the asset. That is, the timing of income recognition should\nreflect the entity receiving the asset directly, rather than the cash to construct or acquire the asset.\nAccordingly, the Board decided that the accounting for such transactions should reflect that of the approach\nin AASB 15. However, given the diverse views as to whether AASB 15 applies, the Board decided to\nspecify instead requirements in AASB 1058 to mirror, to the extent appropriate, the accounting that would\nbe achieved had the transaction been accounted for had it been incontestably a contract with a customer\nwithin the scope of AASB 15.  \nBC99 The Board sought feedback on its proposals in this regard as part of the public \u2018fatal flaw\u2019 review of the  \ndraft Standard. Respondents to the draft Standard were generally supportive of the proposal to include\nspecific requirements for such arrangements.  \nBC100 The Board discussed the following concerns about the proposal:  \n(a) what is meant by \u2018own use\u2019;  \n(b) whether the specified accounting could apply also in instances where the non-financial asset  \nacquired is a resource controlled that meets the definition of an asset but that is not permitted to be\nrecognised by an Accounting Standard; and  \n(c) whether the specified accounting should be extended to apply also in instances where a non\nfinancial asset (for example, construction materials) are made available to the entity, instead of\ncash or another financial asset.  \nBC101 The Board discussed feedback seeking clarification whether the specified accounting could apply to  \ninstances where an asset is constructed as directed but used by others as part of furthering the not-for-profit\nentity\u2019s objectives. For example, a not-for-profit entity whose mission is to provide housing services may\nreceive a grant to construct public housing, however, the not-for-profit entity would not itself occupy the\nbuilding when constructed. The Board observed its intention was for the scope of the accounting specified\nto include such transfers. In finalising AASB 1058, the Board decided to refer instead to \u201ca recognisable\nnon-financial asset to be controlled by the entity\u201d and to add guidance to clarify the types of arrangements\nthat could be within scope.  \nBC102 The Board also discussed whether the specified accounting could apply also in instances where the non\nfinancial asset acquired is a resource controlled that meets the definition of an asset but that is not permitted\nto be recognised by an Accounting Standard. For example, a not-for-profit entity may be provided a grant to\nconduct research services with any detailed research data collected and rights to any commercial use of the\ndata retained by the not-for-profit entity. AASB 138 Intangible Assets does not permit research activity to\nbe recognised as an asset.  \n-----  BC103 The Board considered whether to:  \n(a) limit the application of paragraphs 15\u201317 of the Standard to only grants (and other transfers) to  \ndevelop a non-financial asset that qualifies for recognition under another Australian Accounting\nStandard; or  \n(b) clearly articulate that the application of paragraphs 15\u201317 of the Standard includes grants (and  \nother transfers) to develop a non-financial asset for which recognition is prohibited by another\nAustralian Accounting Standard.  \nBC104 The Board discussed the scope of these paragraphs having regard to grants received to conduct specified  \nresearch activity; the related intellectual property of which may or may not be controlled by the not-forprofit entity recipient. The Board observed that extending the application of paragraphs 15-17 of the\nStandard to include grants (and other transfers) to develop a non-financial asset for which recognition is\nprohibited by another Australian Accounting Standard would be consistent with the underlying principle\nbeing that the grantor intended to transfer a good (rather than a financial asset) to the not-for-profit recipient.\nHowever, the Board was concerned that extending the paragraphs in this manner would:  \n(a) create ambiguity in the distinction between a service and a good, and lack of clarity as to whether  \nan implicit good component in a contract needs to be separately identified from the service. The\nBoard observed that many service contracts in both the not-for-profit and for-profit sector\narguably give rise to (unrecognised) knowledge or expertise to the service renderer;  \n(b) result in a lack of comparability, as some constituents may contend that all the value in such a  \ncontract is attributable to the unrecognised good acquired; while others contend that the value\nremains with the service rendered (ie the good is an incidental product that the customer does not\nvalue in entering the contract). Yet others may contend that some apportionment is appropriate;  \n(c) be seen as being inconsistent with the Board\u2019s decision not to extend the accounting specified by  \nAASB 15 to all transactions of not-for-profit entities, regardless of whether a contract with a\ncustomer exists. The Board could not see a clear distinction why the accounting should differ\nbetween transactions that through the conduct of an activity result in incidentally gaining control\nof intellectual property assets, and an arrangement to deliver services for which income may be\nrecognised immediately in accordance with this Standard; and  \n(d) create confusion as to whether this Standard would allow certain intangible assets to be  \nrecognised, where their recognition is otherwise prohibited.  \nConsequently, the Board decided that the accounting set out in paragraphs 15\u201317 of the Standard should be\nlimited to transactions that will result in a recognisable non-financial asset controlled by the entity.  \nBC105 The Board observed that universities (and other not-for-profit recipients of grants to perform research)  \nwould need to determine whether the accounting for a grant to perform research is specified by AASB 15 or\nAASB 1058. The Board considered its decision to limit the scope of paragraphs 15\u201317 of the Standard will\nnot result in significant additional costs to affected entities, as the entity would already be required to assess\na funding arrangement within the scope of AASB 15 for whether revenue is recognised over time, or at a\npoint in time.  \nBC106 However, given the significance of grants to conduct research to universities and other not-for-profit  \nrecipients, the Board decided to develop several implementation examples to AASB 15 to set out the\naccounting in this regard. The examples illustrate scenarios where income would be recognised immediately\non gaining control of the financial asset in accordance with this Standard, or recognised over time, or at the\nend of the agreement, in accordance with AASB 15. The Board\u2019s considerations in this regard are set out in\nits Basis for Conclusions to AASB 2016-8.",

Consequently, not-for-profit entities may elect to\nrecognise volunteer services based on an accounting policy developed in accordance with AASB 108.\nED 260 proposed clarifying that not-for-profit entities may elect to recognise volunteer services if the fair\nvalue of those services can be measured reliably, without necessarily needing to have been purchased had  \n-----  the services not been donated. In forming the proposal, the Board observed the purchase pre-requisite in\nAASB 1004 was primarily focused on limiting the scope of volunteer services for which recognition by\nparticular public sector not-for-profit entities is required. The Board considered not-for-profit entities\nshould be able to elect to recognise volunteer services with a fair value that can be measured reliably even if\nthose services would not have been purchased if they had not been donated.  \nBC109 The Board noted that carrying forward the treatment of volunteer services from AASB 1004 almost  \nunchanged retains an inconsistency between private sector and public sector not-for-profit entities regarding\nthe scope of the recognition requirements for volunteer services. The Board acknowledged the\ninconsistency reflects the transfer of recognition requirements for volunteer services to AASB 1004 upon the\nwithdrawal of Australian Accounting Standards for specific types of public sector entity (namely, AAS 27\n_Financial Reporting by Local Governments, AAS 29 Financial Reporting by Government Departments and_\nAAS 31 _Financial Reporting by Governments) in 2007, rather than a difference in information needs of_\nusers of financial statements of not-for-profit entities in the private and public sectors.  \nBC110 Many respondents to ED 260 were of the view that the requirements with respect to the recognition of  \nvolunteer services should be the same for all not-for-profit entities. However, many opined that the\nrecognition of volunteer services should be optional, primarily for cost\u2013benefit reasons. Some encouraged\nthe Board to expedite consideration of whether there was differentiation between entities in the sector to\njustify different accounting requirements. Others suggested that the treatment and location of information\nabout volunteer services be reconsidered by the Board.  \nBC111 The Board considered how to progress its consideration of the accounting for volunteer services, having  \nregard to the feedback received. The Board noted further consideration and due process would be required\nbefore it could finalise any broad changes to the current accounting requirements in this regard.\nAccordingly, the Board decided, as a short-term solution, to finalise the recognition and measurement\nproposals largely unamended from those exposed. (See also paragraphs BC123\u2013BC124 below.)  \nBC112 The Board expects to consider the accounting requirements for volunteer services as part of a separate future  \nproject.",

        "page_content=": "## Receipts of inventory  \nBC113 ED 260 proposed that an assessment of whether a transfer of inventory for no consideration is material for  \nrecognition should be made at a transaction level, and need not be reassessed at another unit of account, such\nas at a portfolio of similar transactions. The Board considered such a treatment would be likely to achieve a\nbetter balance of costs and benefits having regard to the extent of transfers of goods for no consideration to\ncharities.  \nBC114 The Board sought specific feedback from constituents as to its proposed approach to the recognition and  \nmeasurement of inventories donated other than as part of a contract with a customer. Most expressed\nsupport for the proposal to assess materiality of a donation of inventory at the transaction level rather than at\na portfolio level.  \nBC115 In its redeliberations, the Board observed that it had presented its discussion on materiality in ED 260 both  \nwithin the general principles for recognition and within specific requirements pertaining to donated\ninventory. The Board confirmed it had not intended to propose that materiality should only be assessed at a\ntransaction level for all transactions (for example, volunteer services or small grants of non-financial assets),\nas evidenced by its specific question pertaining to inventory and requirements of volunteer services.  \nBC116 The Board considered whether further due process is necessary if the final pronouncement limited the  \nproposal that materiality need only be assessed at the transaction level, rather than also at a portfolio level,\nonly to donations of inventory, rather than all inflows of assets. The Board decided that no further due\nprocess is necessary, as not finalising its proposals in that regard would, in the main, maintain the current\nstatus quo. In addition, the Board decided to express the relief in this regard as a practical expedient, rather\nthan a requirement.  \nBC117 AASB 101 defines materiality as \u201comissions or misstatements of items are material if they could,  \nindividually or collectively, influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial\nstatements\u201d. The Board observed that materiality is commonly understood as applying to the whole\nfinancial statements as well as at an individual transaction level. The Board concluded it was not providing\nguidance on interpreting materiality, but providing relief from the normal manner in which materiality\nwould otherwise apply to the entity in respect of inventories. That is, in the absence of the practical\nexpedient, an entity would be required to recognise receipts of inventories for which the consideration paid\nwas significantly less than fair value (including transfers for no or nominal consideration) where the\ninventory overall could materially affect the entity\u2019s financial position and financial performance.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Restrictions on the use of an asset  \nBC126 In its redeliberations, the Board discussed feedback querying whether AASB 1058 should require the  \ndisclosure of restrictions on the use and purpose of amounts recognised as income, including restrictions on\nan entity\u2019s ability to liquidate a related asset or to use it as security. These constituents considered that the\ndisclosure of restrictions is necessary to enable users of financial statements to understand the effects of\ninflows of resources on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity. The Board\nagreed that it would be useful to a user of the financial statements of a not-for-profit entity, for example, to\nunderstand the nature and extent of externally imposed restrictions on resources controlled. The Board\nnoted these disclosures will go some way to addressing respondent concerns that the proposals in ED 260 do\nnot permit the deferral of income to match expenses in all scenarios where a not-for-profit entity considers\nfunds to have been fully committed to a specific purpose.  \nBC127 The Board observed that international standard-setters have specified varying disclosures in this regard. The  \nBoard considered whether it would be appropriate to specify a particular disclosure in this Standard (for\nexample, disclosure of components of equity divided into restricted and unrestricted amounts), but decided\nthat the form of the disclosure should be determined by the not-for-profit entity. This allows an entity to\nadopt an approach that best aligns with the manner in which it manages and presents its financial statements.\nFor the same reason, the Board decided not to define \u201cexternally imposed restrictions\u201d.  \nBC128 To assist users of the Standard, the Board decided to include examples of various forms the disclosure could  \ntake. The Board acknowledged a concern some preparers have with the proposed Standard is that they\nconsider the primary financial statements will continue to misrepresent to users the resources available to the\nentity (as the timing of income recognition may be in advance of the expenses the income received is meant\nto compensate). In response to this feedback, the Board decided to specify in particular, that a not-for-profit\nentity may separately identify on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,\nthe amount of total comprehensive income that is:  \n(a) subject to externally imposed restrictions; and  \n(b) is not subject to any externally imposed restrictions (the \u2018unrestricted\u2019 amount).  \nDisclosing information about its externally imposed restrictions in this form allows entities to distinguish\nbetween \u2018committed\u2019 and \u2018uncommitted\u2019 amounts recognised immediately as income in instances where\nthere is no obligation on the not-for-entity recipient to return assets received in the event the social\nexpectation is not met. The Board expects this disclosure to alleviate, through communication, the concern\nthat users of a not-for-profit entity\u2019s financial statements do not appreciate the \u201ctrue\u201d financial position and\nfinancial performance of the entity, while maintaining the Board\u2019s policy on transaction neutrality. Further,\nthe Board noted by identifying in the Standard that the disclosure may be made on the face of the financial\nstatements (for example, as a subtotal) will avoid ambiguity of whether this is a permissible manner of\nsatisfying the encouraged disclosure.  \nBC129 The Board discussed whether disclosure about externally imposed restrictions should be required, or merely  \nencouraged. The Board noted that it had not exposed a proposal in this regard, and accordingly, decided to\nencourage the disclosure of information in this regard as opposed to requiring entities to make that\ndisclosure.  \nBC130 In addition, the Board observed that:  \n(a) AASB 107 _Statement of Cash Flows_ requires disclosure of the amount of significant cash and  \ncash equivalent balances held by an entity that are not available for use by its group, together with\ncommentary about these balances;  \n(b) AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets require disclosure of  \nthe existence and carrying amounts of assets whose title is restricted; and  \n(c) AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires disclosure of information that enables users  \nof its financial statements to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for its financial\nposition and performance, and the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to\nwhich the entity is exposed at the end of the reporting period.  \nThe Board noted there may be some overlap between the disclosures set out in paragraph 37 of this\nStandard, and these other Australian Accounting Standards.  \n-----  ",

The Board noted that in due\ncourse, it would consider extending the application of the requirements.  \nBC132 As part of this project, the Board reviewed the specified disclosures of compliance with parliamentary  \nappropriations and other externally-imposed requirements required of government departments which had\nbeen included in AASB 1004 (now deleted from that Standard). The Board decided, in light of changes in\npublic sector financial management arrangements since originally developing these requirements, to propose\nextending the scope of disclosures in this regard to include other public sector entities that obtain part or all\nof their spending authority from parliamentary appropriations.  \nBC133 In reviewing the disclosures, the Board acknowledged constituent concerns that the interaction between two  \nof the specified disclosures was unclear, as the scope of paragraph 64(e) of AASB 1004 was broader than\nthe scope of paragraph 64(d). The Board decided to clarify its requirements in this regard by proposing in\nED 260:  \n(a) not to carry forward the text of paragraph 64(e) into AASB 1058; and  \n(b) to require disclosure of the financial consequences of an unauthorised expenditure.  \nBC134 Respondents to the ED were generally supportive of the Board\u2019s proposals in this regard. In its  \nredeliberations, the Board noted a concern raised that by extending the application of these disclosure\nrequirements beyond government departments some might interpret the disclosure requirements as applying\nto for-profit entities in the public sector. The Board observed that the scope of AASB 1058 is limited to notfor-profit entities and therefore for-profit public sector entities would not be subject to these disclosures.  \nBC135 The Board discussed a concern whether the proposed disclosure requirements duplicate existing disclosures  \nin AASB 1055 _Budgetary Reporting. The Board reaffirmed its view that these disclosures contain_\nfundamentally different requirements from AASB 1055 and should be retained, as the disclosures are\nfocused on information concerning how appropriations and other advances received have been expended,\nrather than the more broadly based requirements in AASB 1055 for actual to budget variance analysis (see\nparagraph BC28 in AASB 1055).  \nBC136 In addition, as part of its deliberations, the Board discussed whether to relocate disclosures about a  \ngovernment department\u2019s compliance with parliamentary appropriations and other externally-imposed\nrequirements from AASB 1004 to AASB 1054 Australian Additional Disclosures, rather than this Standard.\nThe Board concluded it would be more user-friendly to include these disclosure requirements in AASB 1058\ngiven the nexus between the income of government departments and appropriated amounts.  \nBC137 Having regard to the feedback received, the Board decided to finalise the disclosure in this regard largely as  \nexposed in ED 260.",

Accordingly, the Board proposed transitional\nrelief on initial application of AASB 1058 be limited to permitting entities the option of recognising the\ncumulative effect of initially applying AASB 1058 in opening retained earnings (or another component of\nequity, as appropriate) at the date of initial application of AASB 1058, to be consistent with AASB 15.  \n-----  BC141 Many respondents were not supportive of the Board\u2019s limited proposals in this regard. In its redeliberations,  \nthe Board noted concerns about the absence of any specific transitional provisions:  \n(a) for existing research, donation and grant funded projects;  \n(b) for assets acquired for no cost or a nominal consideration (including \u201cpeppercorn\u201d leases where a  \nnominal amount is made as payment to the lessor); and  \n(c) in acknowledgement of the short lead time between issue and implementation of AASB 1058.  \nBC142 Having regard to the feedback received, the Board decided to confirm its proposal to allow entities an option  \nbetween fully retrospectively applying the Standard, or recognising the cumulative effect of initially\napplying the Standard at the date of initial application (that is, not to restate comparative information). The\nBoard decided entities should be encouraged, but not required, to restate comparative information on\nadoption of AASB 1058. In addition, the Board redeliberated whether further transitional relief was\nnecessary.  \nBC143 The Board observed that not-for-profit entities commonly receive assets through donations, taxes and other  \nsimilar transfers. The Board acknowledged constituent concerns about the transition requirements for\ninflows of resources previously accounted for in AASB 1004 but now within the scope of this Standard or\nAASB 15. The Board noted that in the absence of any transitional provisions in AASB 1058 or amendment\nto AASB 15, not-for-profit entities would be required to retrospectively apply the requirements of\nAASB 1058 or AASB 15 (where the transaction is within the scope) to contracts for which the associated\ninflow of resources had already been fully recognised in accordance with AASB 1004.  \nBC144 The Board was concerned that this imposed a greater implementation burden on not-for-profit entities  \ncompared to for-profit entities. Consequently, the Board decided to extend the transitional relief in\nAASB 1058 to permit relief from retrospective application for contracts for which the entity has recognised\nall of the income in accordance with AASB 1004, to be consistent with the relief available in IFRS 15 for\ncompleted contracts. The Board also additionally amended the definition of a completed contract in\nAASB 15 to include contracts for which the entity has recognised all of the revenue in accordance with\nAASB 1004, or revenue in combination with a provision in accordance with AASB 137. The extent of the\nrelief is dependent on the entity\u2019s elections on retrospective application.  \nBC145 In ED 260, the Board proposed requiring an asset that has been acquired for consideration that is below  \nmarket but that is more than nominal to be measured at fair value. The Board decided to finalise the\nproposal in issuing this Standard (other than with respect to inventory). However, the Board observed that\nan entity would not have previously applied AASB 1004 to these transactions, nor recognised any income\non the transaction as the asset acquired will generally have been measured at the amount of the consideration\ntransferred. Accordingly, in the absence of any transitional provisions, a not-for-profit entity will be\nrequired to apply the requirements of AASB 1058 retrospectively to such transactions, including\ndetermining the fair value (or, in respect of inventory, current replacement cost) of the asset on acquisition.  \nBC146 In its redeliberations, the Board considered that the costs of applying AASB 1058 retrospectively to all such  \nassets would exceed the benefits of doing so, having regard to the need for an entity to identify and value\nsuch assets still existing at reporting date. Accordingly, the Board determined some form of transitional\nrelief to be appropriate. The Board decided to consider transitional provisions for leases made on\nsignificantly below-market terms and conditions separately from any transitional provisions for other assets.\nThe Board\u2019s considerations with respect to transitional provisions for leases made on significantly belowmarket terms and conditions is set out in paragraphs BC150\u2013BC153 below.  \nBC147 With respect to assets other than lease assets, the Board decided not to require a not-for-profit entity to  \nrevisit the accounting that previously applied on initial recognition of these assets. The Board made this\ndecision having regard to costs involved in identifying and measuring the various assets held on adoption of\nthis Standard that may have been acquired at an amount that was more than nil or nominal, but significantly\nless than fair value, and the associated discount to fair value. The Board considered these costs to outweigh\nthe benefits of retrospective application of the Standard, as these assets are already recognised (generally at\ncost on initial recognition) in the statement of financial position, and noting that there is unlikely to be any\ndeferred income to recognise in future periods in accordance with this Standard.  \nBC148 The Board observed that, consequently, the statement of financial position will reflect a mixed measurement  \nposition for assets acquired for consideration that is significantly less than fair value but more than nominal.\nThose acquired for more than a nominal amount prior to the application of AASB 1058 would continue to be\nreflected at cost on initial recognition. Assets acquired under similar circumstances after adoption of\nAASB 1058 will generally be initially measured at fair value (or current replacement cost, in relation to\ninventories).  \nBC149 The Board decided that the transitional relief for other assets need not be aligned with transitional relief for  \nleases. In making this decision, the Board considered:  \n-----  (a) the quantum of transactions involving a lease. The Board observed it expects an entity to have  \nundertaken fewer transactions involving leases, and that the terms and conditions of these\ntransactions to be clearly identifiable, compared to acquisitions of other assets at a discount to fair\nvalue; and  \n(b) that a lessee may not necessarily have recognised an amount in its statement of financial position  \nin respect of the right-to-use asset in an operating lease.",

The Board made this decision having regard\nto:  \n(a) the diversity in accounting for such leases under previous requirements (see paragraph BC6  \nabove);  \n(b) the potential significance of leases made on such terms to the financial position of a not-for-profit  \nentity; and  \n(c) the prevalence of below-market leases in the not-for-profit sector.  \nBC151 The Board considered whether to:  \n(a) require retrospective application of this Standard, without any relief on initial application;  \n(b) permit a not-for-profit lessee to continue its existing accounting for such leases, in a similar  \nmanner to the relief specified for other transactions; or  \n(c) permit a not-for-profit lessee access to a similar level of relief on initial application of this  \nStandard as is available to a for-profit entity on adoption of AASB 16.  \nBC152 The Board decided that it should, at a minimum, permit a not-for-profit lessee access to a similar level of  \nrelief on initial application of this Standard as is available to a for-profit entity on adoption of AASB 16.\nHowever, having regard to its decisions on the measurement of assets acquired in a lease (see\nparagraph BC84 above), the Board concluded it would be appropriate to modify the transitional provisions\nset out in AASB 16 to require the lease asset, on initial adoption of this Standard, to be measured at its fair\nvalue rather than by reference to the lease liability.  \nBC153 In its discussion, the Board decided not to permit a not-for-profit lessee to continue its existing accounting  \nfor such leases, in a similar manner to the relief specified for other transactions. The Board made this\ndecision having regard to its concern the financial position of a not-for-profit entity may be misrepresented,\nand the lack of comparability between entities if such leases were entered into before and after adoption of\nthis Standard.",

Having regard to this and\nthe feedback received about the adequacy of the transitional provisions in ED 260, the Board decided to add\nearly adoption transition requirements to AASB 1058.  \nBC155 The scope of AASB 1058 extends to leases provided to a not-for-profit entity on significantly below-market  \nterms and conditions at inception principally to enable an entity to further its objectives. Not-for-profit\nentities can apply AASB 1058 early before the mandatory application date of AASB 16, thereby applying\nAASB 1058 alongside AASB 117. Under AASB 117, leases classified as operating leases do not give rise\nto a recognised asset of the lessee. The Board considered whether a not-for-profit lessee should be required\nto recognise right-of-use assets arising from operating leases at fair value when applying AASB 1058 before\nadopting AASB 16, noting this approach would be consistent with the objective of this Standard. However,\nthe Board was conscious that it were to do so, it would place an additional burden on not-for-profit lessees,\nand would not be in keeping with its policy on transaction neutrality. Consequently, and having regard to\nthe short lead time before AASB 16 becomes effective, the Board decided to require entities to continue\napplying the requirements of AASB 117 in respect of operating leases until transition to AASB 16.  \nBC156 With respect to finance leases within the scope of AASB 117, the Board noted that a lessee may not have  \npreviously measured a finance lease asset, in a lease made on significantly below-market terms and\nconditions at inception principally to enable an entity to further its objectives, at fair value on initial\nrecognition. The Board considered the costs to a lessee of having to fully retrospectively apply AASB 1058\nto such leases were likely to outweigh the benefits to users of doing so. Consequently, the Board decided to\nrequire a lessee to measure the fair value of a finance leased asset at the date of initial application of  \n-----  AASB 1058 (if paragraph C3(b) applies) or at the beginning of the earliest period presented (if paragraph\nC3(a) applies). The Board decided it was not necessary to require the entity to remeasure the leased asset to\nfair value again on adoption of AASB 16.",

In making its decision, the Board had regard to the extent of amendment to AASB 1 as a\nconsequence of the issue of AASB 15 and AASB 16.  \nBC158 The Board noted that a not-for-profit entity applying AASB 1 would be able to access the relief specified in  \nAASB 15 in respect of contracts for which the entity has previously fully recognised income in accordance\nwith AASB 1004 (refer paragraphs D34-D35 of AASB 1). Consequently, the Board decided no further\namendment was required in this regard.  \nBC159 The Board observed that AASB 1 specifies the accounting on first-time adoption of Australian Accounting  \nStandards for lease assets and lease liabilities, including practical expedients that may be adopted. The\nBoard noted, in the absence of developing Australian specific amendments to AASB 1, it is unclear how a\nlease within the scope of AASB 1058 should be treated in the financial statements of a first-time adopter of\nAustralian Accounting Standards.  \nBC160 The Board considered whether the general features of the exemptions available for lease assets and lease  \nliabilities in AASB 1 should apply also to leases with significantly below-market terms and conditions at\ninception. The Board noted if it did so, assets acquired through such leases could remain understated in a\nfirst-time adopter\u2019s financial statements. The Board considered this reduced comparability between a notfor-profit first-time adopter and a not-for-profit entity that is already applying Australian Accounting\nStandards. Accordingly, the Board decided not to extend this exemption to leases for which the initial\nrecognition and measurement is specified by AASB 1058. However, the Board considered that some\nmeasure of transitional relief is necessary, and decided a first-time adopter should have access to similar\nrelief in this regard as an entity already applying Australian Accounting Standards.",

The Board discussed the\neffective date of AASB 1058 (and AASB 2016-8, also issued as part of this project), noting its intention had\nbeen to align the effective date of any pronouncements resulting from this project with the effective date of\nAASB 15. The Board was concerned that an effective date of 1 January 2018 could disadvantage not-forprofit entities compared to for-profit entities applying AASB 15, as not-for-profit entities would have\nsignificantly less lead time before implementation of AASB 1058. The Board considered that the\ntransitional provisions may not provide sufficient relief to entities in this regard.  \nBC162 In addition, the Board considered whether to similarly defer the application date of AASB 15 for not-for\nprofit entities. The Board discussed the interaction between AASB 15, AASB 1004 and AASB 1058 should\nthe application date of AASB 15 differ from that of AASB 1058, including:  \n(a) whether the scope of AASB 1004 should take precedence over AASB 15 for affected entities.  \n(that is, transaction types subject to AASB 1004 would continue to be subject to that Standard,\nuntil such time as AASB 1058 became effective); and  \n(b) the effect on comparability for transactions that may be accounted for in accordance with  \nAASB 1004 by not-for-profit entities but in accordance with AASB 15 by for-profit entities.  \nBC163 The Board considered that it would be preferable for the effective date of AASB 1058, AASB 2016-8 and  \nAASB 15 to be aligned for application by not-for-profit entities, rather than adopt a stepped approach to\nadopting the revised income recognition requirements. Having regard to the timing of finalisation of this\nproject, the Board decided, for not-for-profit entities, to defer the application date of AASB 1058,\nAASB 2016-8 and AASB 15 to 1 January 2019. The amendment to defer the application date of AASB 15\nto 1 January 2019 for not-for-profit entities is made by AASB 2016-7.  \nBC164 The Board decided to permit entities to early adopt AASB 1058, provided AASB 15 and AASB 2016-8 are  \napplied at the same time. The ability to early adopt means that a not-for-profit entity wishing to adopt the\nrevised requirements at the same time as a for-profit entity is not prevented from doing so.  \n-----  ",

The Board observed:  \n(a) the IASB has not defined a similar term employed within the definition of \u2018income\u2019 in IFRS  \nStandards; and  \n(b) the IPSASB\u2019s Public Sector Conceptual Framework includes a broader definition of \u2018ownership  \ncontributions\u2019 than that in Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC169 Acknowledging constituent concerns about application of the term, the Board decided to invite comment on  \nthe defined term \u201ccontributions by owners\u201d as part of this project. The Board did not make a specific\nproposal regarding the definition of \u201ccontributions by owners\u201d. Instead, ED 260 illustrated what a\nreplacement Standard for AASB 1004 would look like without that definition and particular related\nguidance, and posed related questions including whether a definition of \u2018contributions by owners\u2019 is still\nnecessary, or appropriate.  \nBC170 In responding to the ED, constituents noted the definition in AASB 1004 can be problematic, identified a  \nneed for a definition of contributions by owners and expressed their support for applying the IPSASB\ndefinition or using the IPSASB definition as the basis for an Australian definition. Many respondents\nconsidered a definition was necessary to minimise diversity in practice.  \nBC171 In addition, the majority of respondents to ED 260 responding on this topic supported the withdrawal of  \nInterpretation 1038.  \nBC172 Having regard to the feedback received, the Board considered whether to:  \n(a) withdraw and not replace the current definition in AASB 1004 and Interpretation 1038;  \n(b) replace the current definition in AASB 1004 with the definition of ownership contributions  \nadopted by the IPSASB, and separately consider whether to retain an amended\nInterpretation 1038; or  \n(c) address the accounting for contributions by owners as part of a separate project.  \nBC173 The Board was conscious of the need to finalise its proposals on other aspects of its current project in a  \ntimely manner.

Accordingly, the Board decided to\nprogress consideration of \u2018contributions by owners\u2019 and the related requirements as part of a separate\nproject. Consequently, the Board decided to retain, for the interim:  \n(a) the terms \u2018contributions\u2019 and \u2018contributions by owners\u2019 as presently defined in Australian  \nAccounting Standards;  \n(b) the requirements specified in AASB 1004 and AASB Interpretation 1038 _Contributions by_  \n_Owners Made to Wholly-Owned Public Sector Entities_ with respect to contributions by owners\nand distributions to owners; and  \n-----  (c) the requirements specified in AASB 1004 with respect to contributions by owners and  \ndistributions to owners, including those arising in relation to restructures of administrative\narrangements.",

The Board noted that  \ndifferences between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Government Finance Statistics\n(GFS) may arise in relation to the following:  \n(a) timing of recognition of income tax revenue \u2013 income tax revenue is recognised under GFS in  \nadvance of AASB 1058 (see Appendix C of AASB 9);  \n(b) timing of recognition of property tax revenue \u2013 property tax revenue is recognised under GFS  \nlater than AASB 1058 (see Appendix C of AASB 9). The Board considered constituent feedback\nthat GFS requires income to be recognised progressively over the period of the levy;  \n(c) timing of revenue recognition on transfer of goods \u2013 GFS generally recognises revenue on legal  \nchange in title, while AASB 1058, with limited exception, requires income to be recognised on\nrecognition of the asset. Under Australian Accounting Standards, an entity must control the asset\nfor recognition to occur, which could be at a point in time earlier than on legal change in title;  \n(d) recognised income for certain volunteer services received \u2013 GFS does not recognise any income  \nrepresenting the fair value of volunteer services received; and  \n(e) recognition of provisions in accordance with AASB 137 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and_  \n_Contingent Assets \u2013 the amount of income recognised under GAAP and GFS will differ where a_\nprovision relating to the transaction or event is recognised in accordance with Australian\nAccounting Standards but not under GFS.  \nBC175 The Board weighed its policy on GAAP/GFS harmonisation against its policy of transaction neutrality. The  \nBoard observed that some areas of potential difference were known when developing AASB 1049. Others\nwere more likely to give rise to differences only in interim reporting periods, or are driven by a difference in\nthe underlying principles. Further, some differences could only be addressed by making changes to the\nunderlying principles in AASB 1058 and AASB 15.  \nBC176 On balance, the Board considered that it was not necessary to amend its decisions reflected in AASB 1058  \nin order to achieve GAAP/GFS harmonisation. The Board noted that AASB 1049 _Whole of Government_\n_and General Government Sector Financial Reporting will require entities to identify and explain any_\ndifferences arising from different requirements in GAAP as compared to GFS.",

        "page_content=": "## Comparison with International Public Sector Accounting Standards  \nBC177 As part of its deliberations, the Board considered the accounting for income of not-for-profit entities  \nspecified by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB). The Board noted the\nfollowing International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) specified the accounting in this regard:  \n(a) IPSAS 9 Revenue from Exchange Transactions;  \n(b) IPSAS 11 Construction Contracts;  \n(c) IPSAS 23 Revenue from Non-exchange Transactions (Taxes and Transfers).  \nBC178 The Board observed IPSAS 9 and IPSAS 11 are based on the principles of superseded IAS 18 _Revenue_  \n(incorporated into AASB 118 _Revenue) and IAS 11_ _Construction Contracts (incorporated into AASB 111_\n_Construction Contracts), rather than those of IFRS 15_ _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_\n(incorporated into AASB 15). In addition, it noted that IPSAS 23 was issued prior to the issue of IFRS 15.\nThe requirements of IPSAS 23 were therefore not necessarily developed with reference to similar principles\nof IFRS 15. The Board concluded these IPSASB Standards do not provide an appropriate basis for financial\nreporting in the Australian environment, particularly because they require different income recognition\ndepending on whether the transaction is an exchange transaction or a non-exchange transaction, and\nIPSAS 9 and IPSAS 11 adopt a \u2018risks and rewards\u2019 approach that is not consistent with the performance\nobligation approach in IFRS 15.  \nBC179 The Board further noted the IPSASB is currently developing proposals for the accounting of non-exchange  \nexpenses. The IPSASB is also developing a related project on revenue, which uses IFRS 15 as a starting\npoint and looks at the type of modifications that would be required for IFRS 15 to be suitable for application\nto a wide range of revenue transactions in the public sector. This may result in revisions to, or a replacement  \n-----  of, the existing revenue recognition requirements. The Board noted that the issues to be considered under\nthe IPSASB revenue project could result in outcomes that are similar to what the Board had achieved in\nfinalising AASB 1058. The IPSASB expects to complete these projects in 2019. The Board noted that it\nwould consider undertaking a project to review the accounting specified by AASB 1058 following the\ncompletion of these projects.  \nBC180 The Board noted the following differences between AASB 1058 and IPSAS 9, IPSAS 11 and IPSAS 23  \narise as a result of its decisions in finalising AASB 1058:  \n(a) recognition criteria \u2013 the Board decided not to specify asset recognition criteria in AASB 1058,  \nbut to require an entity to recognise assets as specified by other Australian Accounting Standards\n(other than in respect of volunteer services). In contrast, IPSAS 23 specifies that an asset is\nrecognised where it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the\nentity and its fair value can be measured reliably;  \n(b) fair value of an asset \u2013 the consequential amendments arising from AASB 1058 require various  \nassets acquired for consideration that is significantly less than the fair value of the asset\nprincipally to enable the entity to further its objectives, to be initially measured at fair value in\naccordance with AASB 13. AASB 1058 also requires any related amounts to the asset to be\nrecognised and measured in accordance with other Australian Accounting Standards. The\nIPSASB does not have a fair value measurement standard similar to AASB 13 and therefore\nIPSAS 9, IPSAS 11 and IPSAS 23 do not include such a reference;  \n(c) exchange and non-exchange transactions \u2013 IPSAS 9 and IPSAS 23 require income recognition  \nbased on whether it is an exchange or non-exchange transaction (a transaction in which the entity\nreceives value from another entity without giving approximately equal value in exchange)\nrespectively. IPSAS 23 requires a non-exchange transfer to be recognised as an asset and\ncorresponding revenue when the entity does not have a liability in respect of the same asset.\nWhere a liability is initially recognised, an entity recognises revenue and reduces the liability\nwhen it satisfies the present obligations associated with the asset. Except in certain specified\ninstances, AASB 1058 requires an entity to recognise as income immediately in profit or loss the\nexcess of the initial carrying amount of an asset over the related amounts recognised in\naccordance with other Australian Accounting Standards in the form of contributions by owners,\nliabilities and revenue;  \n(d) volunteer services \u2013 IPSAS 23 permits an entity to elect whether to recognise services in-kind (ie  \nvolunteer services) as revenue and an asset. AASB 1058 requires local government, government\ndepartments, general government sectors and whole of government to recognise volunteer services\nas income (or where appropriate, a contribution by owner) if the fair value of the services can be\nmeasured reliably and if the services would have been purchased if they had not been donated.\nAll other entities may elect to recognise volunteer services if those services can be measured\nreliably; and  \n(e) disclosure \u2013 AASB 1058 includes a number of disclosure requirements that are not included in  \nIPSAS 9, IPSAS 11 and IPSAS 23, such as the requirement for government departments to\ndisclose information relating to compliance with parliamentary appropriations and other externally\nimposed requirements. IPSAS 9 and IPSAS 23 require some disclosures that are not included in\nAASB 1058, such as the disclosure of the methods adopted to determine the stage of completion\nof transactions involving the rendering of services. Additionally, IPSAS 23 encourages, but does\nnot require, the disclosure about the nature and type of all volunteer services received, whether\nthey are recognised or not. This contrasts with AASB 1058, which requires the disclosure of\nvolunteer services that are recognised during the period, and encourages disclosure about the\nnature of the entity\u2019s dependence on volunteer services, including those not recognised.  \n-----  ",
