However, this Standard applies to assets that are\ncarried at revalued amount (ie fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated\ndepreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses) in accordance with other Australian\nAccounting Standards, such as the revaluation model in AASB 116 _Property, Plant and Equipment and_\nAASB 138 Intangible Assets. The only difference between an asset\u2019s fair value and its fair value less costs\nof disposal is the direct incremental costs attributable to the disposal of the asset.  \n(a) If the disposal costs are negligible, the recoverable amount of the revalued asset is necessarily\nclose to, or greater than, its revalued amount. In this case, after the revaluation requirements have\nbeen applied, it is unlikely that the revalued asset is impaired and recoverable amount need not be\nestimated.  \n(b) [deleted]  \n(c) If the disposal costs are not negligible, the fair value less costs of disposal of the revalued asset is\nnecessarily less than its fair value. Therefore, the revalued asset will be impaired if its value in\nuse is less than its revalued amount. In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been\napplied, an entity applies this Standard to determine whether the asset may be impaired.  \nAus5.1 Many assets of not-for-profit entities that are not held primarily for their ability to generate net\ncash inflows are typically specialised assets held for continuing use of their service capacity.\nGiven that these assets are rarely sold, their cost of disposal is typically negligible. The\nrecoverable amount of such assets is expected to be materially the same as fair value, determined\nunder AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement, with the consequence that this Standard:  \n(a) does not apply to such assets that are regularly revalued to fair value under the revaluation\nmodel in AASB 116 and AASB 138; and  \n(b) applies to such assets accounted for under the cost model in AASB 116 and AASB 138.",

These requirements use the term\n\u2018an asset\u2019 but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit. The remainder of this Standard\nis structured as follows:  \n(a) paragraphs 18\u201357 set out the requirements for measuring recoverable amount. These\nrequirements also use the term \u2018an asset\u2019 but apply equally to an individual asset and a cashgenerating unit.  \n(b) paragraphs 58\u2013108 set out the requirements for recognising and measuring impairment losses.\nRecognition and measurement of impairment losses for individual assets other than goodwill are\ndealt with in paragraphs 58\u201364. Paragraphs 65\u2013108 deal with the recognition and measurement of\nimpairment losses for cash-generating units and goodwill.  \n(c) paragraphs 109\u2013116 set out the requirements for reversing an impairment loss recognised in prior\nperiods for an asset or a cash-generating unit. Again, these requirements use the term \u2018an asset\u2019\nbut apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit. Additional requirements for an\nindividual asset are set out in paragraphs 117\u2013121, for a cash-generating unit in paragraphs 122\nand 123, and for goodwill in paragraphs 124 and 125.  \n(d) paragraphs 126\u2013133 specify the information to be disclosed about impairment losses and\nreversals of impairment losses for assets and cash-generating units. Paragraphs 134\u2013137 specify\nadditional disclosure requirements for cash-generating units to which goodwill or intangible\nassets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated for impairment testing purposes.  \n8 An asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Paragraphs 12\u201314 describe\nsome indications that an impairment loss may have occurred. If any of those indications is present, an entity\nis required to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Except as described in paragraph 10, this\nStandard does not require an entity to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount if no indication of an\nimpairment loss is present.  \n**9** **An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset**\n**may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the**\n**asset.**  \n**10** **Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an entity shall also:**  \n**(a)** **test an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life** **or an intangible asset not yet available**\n**for use for impairment annually by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable**\n**amount. This impairment test may be performed at any time during an annual period,**\n**provided it is performed at the same time every year. Different intangible assets may be**\n**tested for impairment at different times. However, if such an intangible asset was initially**\n**recognised during the current annual period, that intangible asset shall be tested for**\n**impairment before the end of the current annual period.**  \n**(b)** **test goodwill acquired in a business combination for impairment annually in accordance**\n**with paragraphs 80\u201399.**  \n11 The ability of an intangible asset to generate sufficient future economic benefits to recover its carrying\namount is usually subject to greater uncertainty before the asset is available for use than after it is available\nfor use. Therefore, this Standard requires an entity to test for impairment, at least annually, the carrying\namount of an intangible asset that is not yet available for use.  \n**12** **In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an entity shall consider, as**\n**a minimum, the following indications:**  \nExternal sources of information  \n**(a)** **there are observable indications that the asset\u2019s value has declined during the period**\n**significantly more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use.**  \n-----  **(b)** **significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period,**\n**or will take place in the near future, in the technological, market, economic or legal**\n**environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which an asset is dedicated.**  \n**(c)** **market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during**\n**the period, and those increases are likely to affect the discount rate** **used in calculating an**\n**asset\u2019s value in use and decrease the asset\u2019s recoverable amount materially.**  \n**(d)** **the carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalisation.**  \nInternal sources of information  \n**(e)** **evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset.**  \n**(f)** **significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period,**\n**or are expected to take place in the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which,**\n**an asset is used or is expected to be used. These changes include the asset becoming idle,**\n**plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose**\n**of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as**\n**finite rather than indefinite.[2]**  \n**(g)** **evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance**\n**of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.**  \nDividend from a subsidiary, joint venture or associate  \n**(h)** **for an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the investor recognises a**\n**dividend from the investment and evidence is available that:**  \n**(i)** **the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial statements exceeds**\n**the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the investee\u2019s net**\n**assets, including associated goodwill; or**  \n**(ii)** **the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary, joint**\n**venture or associate in the period the dividend is declared.**  \n13 The list in paragraph 12 is not exhaustive. An entity may identify other indications that an asset may be\nimpaired and these would also require the entity to determine the asset\u2019s recoverable amount or, in the case\nof goodwill, perform an impairment test in accordance with paragraphs 80\u201399.  \n14 Evidence from internal reporting that indicates that an asset may be impaired includes the existence of:  \n(a) cash flows for acquiring the asset, or subsequent cash needs for operating or maintaining it, that\nare significantly higher than those originally budgeted;  \n(b) actual net cash flows or operating profit or loss flowing from the asset that are significantly worse\nthan those budgeted;  \n(c) a significant decline in budgeted net cash flows or operating profit, or a significant increase in\nbudgeted loss, flowing from the asset; or  \n(d) operating losses or net cash outflows for the asset, when current period amounts are aggregated\nwith budgeted amounts for the future.  \n15 As indicated in paragraph 10, this Standard requires an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or not\nyet available for use and goodwill to be tested for impairment, at least annually. Apart from when the\nrequirements in paragraph 10 apply, the concept of materiality applies in identifying whether the\nrecoverable amount of an asset needs to be estimated. For example, if previous calculations show that an\nasset\u2019s recoverable amount is significantly greater than its carrying amount, the entity need not re-estimate\nthe asset\u2019s recoverable amount if no events have occurred that would eliminate that difference. Similarly,\nprevious analysis may show that an asset\u2019s recoverable amount is not sensitive to one (or more) of the\nindications listed in paragraph 12.  \n16 As an illustration of paragraph 15, if market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments\nhave increased during the period, an entity is not required to make a formal estimate of an asset\u2019s\nrecoverable amount in the following cases:  \n2 Once an asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or is included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale), it is\nexcluded from the scope of this Standard and is accounted for in accordance with AASB 5 _Non-current Assets Held for Sale and_\n_Discontinued Operations._  \n-----  (a) if the discount rate used in calculating the asset\u2019s value in use is unlikely to be affected by the\nincrease in these market rates. For example, increases in short-term interest rates may not have a\nmaterial effect on the discount rate used for an asset that has a long remaining useful life.  \n(b) if the discount rate used in calculating the asset\u2019s value in use is likely to be affected by the\nincrease in these market rates but previous sensitivity analysis of recoverable amount shows that:  \n(i) it is unlikely that there will be a material decrease in recoverable amount because future\ncash flows are also likely to increase (eg in some cases, an entity may be able to\ndemonstrate that it adjusts its revenues to compensate for any increase in market rates);\nor  \n(ii) the decrease in recoverable amount is unlikely to result in a material impairment loss.  \n17 If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, this may indicate that the remaining useful life, the\ndepreciation (amortisation) method or the residual value for the asset needs to be reviewed and adjusted in\naccordance with the Standard applicable to the asset, even if no impairment loss is recognised for the asset.",

However, sometimes it will not be possible to measure fair value less costs of\ndisposal because there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction\nto sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market\nconditions. In this case, the entity may use the asset\u2019s value in use as its recoverable amount.  \n21 If there is no reason to believe that an asset\u2019s value in use materially exceeds its fair value less costs of\ndisposal, the asset\u2019s fair value less costs of disposal may be used as its recoverable amount. This will often\nbe the case for an asset that is held for disposal. This is because the value in use of an asset held for disposal\nwill consist mainly of the net disposal proceeds, as the future cash flows from continuing use of the asset\nuntil its disposal are likely to be negligible.  \n22 Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows\nthat are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, recoverable\namount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (see paragraphs 65\u2013103),\nunless either:  \n(a) the asset\u2019s fair value less costs of disposal is higher than its carrying amount; or  \n(b) the asset\u2019s value in use can be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal and fair\nvalue less costs of disposal can be measured.  \n23 In some cases, estimates, averages and computational short cuts may provide reasonable approximations of\nthe detailed computations illustrated in this Standard for determining fair value less costs of disposal or\nvalue in use.",

Therefore, if the discount rate includes the effect of price increases\nattributable to general inflation, future cash flows are estimated in nominal terms. If the discount rate\nexcludes the effect of price increases attributable to general inflation, future cash flows are estimated in real\nterms (but include future specific price increases or decreases).  \n41 Projections of cash outflows include those for the day-to-day servicing of the asset as well as future\noverheads that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis, to the use of the\nasset.  \n42 When the carrying amount of an asset does not yet include all the cash outflows to be incurred before it is\nready for use or sale, the estimate of future cash outflows includes an estimate of any further cash outflow\nthat is expected to be incurred before the asset is ready for use or sale. For example, this is the case for a\nbuilding under construction or for a development project that is not yet completed.  \n43 To avoid double-counting, estimates of future cash flows do not include:  \n(a) cash inflows from assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash\ninflows from the asset under review (for example, financial assets such as receivables); and  \n(b) cash outflows that relate to obligations that have been recognised as liabilities (for example,\npayables, pensions or provisions).  \n**44** **Future cash flows shall be estimated for the asset in its current condition. Estimates of future cash**\n**flows shall not include estimated future cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from:**  \n**(a)** **a future restructuring to which an entity is not yet committed; or**  \n**(b)** **improving or enhancing the asset\u2019s performance.**  \n-----  45 Because future cash flows are estimated for the asset in its current condition, value in use does not reflect:  \n(a) future cash outflows or related cost savings (for example reductions in staff costs) or benefits that\nare expected to arise from a future restructuring to which an entity is not yet committed; or  \n(b) future cash outflows that will improve or enhance the asset\u2019s performance or the related cash\ninflows that are expected to arise from such outflows.  \n46 A restructuring is a programme that is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either\nthe scope of the business undertaken by an entity or the manner in which the business is conducted.\nAASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets contains guidance clarifying when an\nentity is committed to a restructuring.  \n47 When an entity becomes committed to a restructuring, some assets are likely to be affected by this\nrestructuring. Once the entity is committed to the restructuring:  \n(a) its estimates of future cash inflows and cash outflows for the purpose of determining value in use\nreflect the cost savings and other benefits from the restructuring (based on the most recent\nfinancial budgets/forecasts approved by management); and  \n(b) its estimates of future cash outflows for the restructuring are included in a restructuring provision\nin accordance with AASB 137.  \nIllustrative Example 5 illustrates the effect of a future restructuring on a value in use calculation.  \n48 Until an entity incurs cash outflows that improve or enhance the asset\u2019s performance, estimates of future\ncash flows do not include the estimated future cash inflows that are expected to arise from the increase in\neconomic benefits associated with the cash outflow (see Illustrative Example 6).  \n49 Estimates of future cash flows include future cash outflows necessary to maintain the level of economic\nbenefits expected to arise from the asset in its current condition. When a cash-generating unit consists of\nassets with different estimated useful lives, all of which are essential to the ongoing operation of the unit,\nthe replacement of assets with shorter lives is considered to be part of the day-to-day servicing of the unit\nwhen estimating the future cash flows associated with the unit. Similarly, when a single asset consists of\ncomponents with different estimated useful lives, the replacement of components with shorter lives is\nconsidered to be part of the day-to-day servicing of the asset when estimating the future cash flows\ngenerated by the asset.  \n**50** **Estimates of future cash flows shall not include:**  \n**(a)** **cash inflows or outflows from financing activities; or**  \n**(b)** **income tax receipts or payments.**  \n51 Estimated future cash flows reflect assumptions that are consistent with the way the discount rate is\ndetermined. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be counted twice or ignored. Because the time\nvalue of money is considered by discounting the estimated future cash flows, these cash flows exclude cash\ninflows or outflows from financing activities. Similarly, because the discount rate is determined on a pre-tax\nbasis, future cash flows are also estimated on a pre-tax basis.  \n**52** **The estimate of net cash flows to be received (or paid) for the disposal of an asset at the end of its**\n**useful life shall be the amount that an entity expects to obtain from the disposal of the asset in an**\n**arm\u2019s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, after deducting the estimated costs**\n**of disposal.**  \n53 The estimate of net cash flows to be received (or paid) for the disposal of an asset at the end of its useful life\nis determined in a similar way to an asset\u2019s fair value less costs of disposal, except that, in estimating those\nnet cash flows:  \n(a) an entity uses prices prevailing at the date of the estimate for similar assets that have reached the\nend of their useful life and have operated under conditions similar to those in which the asset will\nbe used.  \n(b) the entity adjusts those prices for the effect of both future price increases due to general inflation\nand specific future price increases or decreases. However, if estimates of future cash flows from\nthe asset\u2019s continuing use and the discount rate exclude the effect of general inflation, the entity\nalso excludes this effect from the estimate of net cash flows on disposal.  \n53A Fair value differs from value in use. Fair value reflects the assumptions market participants would use when\npricing the asset. In contrast, value in use reflects the effects of factors that may be specific to the entity and\nnot applicable to entities in general. For example, fair value does not reflect any of the following factors to\nthe extent that they would not be generally available to market participants:  \n-----  (a) additional value derived from the grouping of assets (such as the creation of a portfolio of\ninvestment properties in different locations);  \n(b) synergies between the asset being measured and other assets;  \n(c) legal rights or legal restrictions that are specific only to the current owner of the asset; and  \n(d) tax benefits or tax burdens that are specific to the current owner of the asset.",

The private railway could be sold\nonly for scrap value and it does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows\nfrom the other assets of the mine.  \n_It is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the private railway because its value in use_\n_cannot be determined and is probably different from scrap value. Therefore, the entity estimates the_\n_recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the private railway belongs, ie the mine as a_\n_whole._  \n68 As defined in paragraph 6, an asset\u2019s cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that includes the\nasset and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups\nof assets. Identification of an asset\u2019s cash-generating unit involves judgement. If recoverable amount cannot\nbe determined for an individual asset, an entity identifies the lowest aggregation of assets that generate\nlargely independent cash inflows.  \n### Example\nA bus company provides services under contract with a municipality that requires minimum service on\neach of five separate routes. Assets devoted to each route and the cash flows from each route can be\nidentified separately. One of the routes operates at a significant loss.  \n_Because the entity does not have the option to curtail any one bus route, the lowest level of identifiable_\n_cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets is the_\n_cash inflows generated by the five routes together. The cash-generating unit for each route is the bus_\n_company as a whole._  \n69 Cash inflows are inflows of cash and cash equivalents received from parties external to the entity. In\nidentifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or group of assets) are largely independent of the cash\ninflows from other assets (or groups of assets), an entity considers various factors including how\nmanagement monitors the entity\u2019s operations (such as by product lines, businesses, individual locations,  \n-----  districts or regional areas) or how management makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the\nentity\u2019s assets and operations. Illustrative Example 1 gives examples of identification of a cash-generating\nunit.  \n**70** **If an active market exists for the output produced by an asset or group of assets, that asset or group**\n**of assets shall be identified as a cash-generating unit, even if some or all of the output is used**\n**internally.

For the purpose of determining the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit, any reference in paragraphs 19\u201357 to \u2018an asset\u2019 is read as a reference to \u2018a cash-generating\nunit\u2019.  \n**75** **The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit shall be determined on a basis consistent with the way**\n**the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined.**  \n76 The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit:  \n(a) includes the carrying amount of only those assets that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a\nreasonable and consistent basis, to the cash-generating unit and will generate the future cash\ninflows used in determining the cash-generating unit\u2019s value in use; and  \n(b) does not include the carrying amount of any recognised liability, unless the recoverable amount\nof the cash-generating unit cannot be determined without consideration of this liability.  \nThis is because fair value less costs of disposal and value in use of a cash-generating unit are determined\nexcluding cash flows that relate to assets that are not part of the cash-generating unit and liabilities that have\nbeen recognised (see paragraphs 28 and 43).  \n77 When assets are grouped for recoverability assessments, it is important to include in the cash-generating\nunit all assets that generate or are used to generate the relevant stream of cash inflows. Otherwise, the cashgenerating unit may appear to be fully recoverable when in fact an impairment loss has occurred. In some\ncases, although some assets contribute to the estimated future cash flows of a cash-generating unit, they\ncannot be allocated to the cash-generating unit on a reasonable and consistent basis. This might be the case\nfor goodwill or corporate assets such as head office assets. Paragraphs 80\u2013103 explain how to deal with\nthese assets in testing a cash-generating unit for impairment.  \n78 It may be necessary to consider some recognised liabilities to determine the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit. This may occur if the disposal of a cash-generating unit would require the buyer to assume\nthe liability. In this case, the fair value less costs of disposal (or the estimated cash flow from ultimate\ndisposal) of the cash-generating unit is the price to sell the assets of the cash-generating unit and the liability\ntogether, less the costs of disposal. To perform a meaningful comparison between the carrying amount of  \n-----  the cash-generating unit and its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the liability is deducted in\ndetermining both the cash-generating unit\u2019s value in use and its carrying amount.",

The cost of restoration includes the replacement of the\noverburden, which must be removed before mining operations commence.

The amount provided\nwas recognised as part of the cost of the mine and is being depreciated over the mine\u2019s useful life. The\ncarrying amount of the provision for restoration costs is CU500,[(a)] which is equal to the present value of\nthe restoration costs.  \nThe entity is testing the mine for impairment. The cash-generating unit for the mine is the mine as a\nwhole. The entity has received various offers to buy the mine at a price of around CU800. This price\nreflects the fact that the buyer will assume the obligation to restore the overburden. Disposal costs for the\nmine are negligible. The value in use of the mine is approximately CU1,200, excluding restoration costs.\nThe carrying amount of the mine is CU1,000.  \n_The cash-generating unit\u2019s fair value less costs of disposal is CU800.

Each**\n**unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall:**  \n**(a)** **represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal**\n**management purposes; and**  \n**(b)** **not be larger than an operating segment as defined by paragraph 5 of AASB 8** **_Operating_**\n**_Segments before aggregation._**  \n81 Goodwill recognised in a business combination is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising\nfrom other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately\nrecognised. Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets, and\noften contributes to the cash flows of multiple cash-generating units. Goodwill sometimes cannot be\nallocated on a non-arbitrary basis to individual cash-generating units, but only to groups of cash-generating\nunits. As a result, the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal\nmanagement purposes sometimes comprises a number of cash-generating units to which the goodwill\nrelates, but to which it cannot be allocated. References in paragraphs 83\u201399 and Appendix C to a cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is allocated should be read as references also to a group of cashgenerating units to which goodwill is allocated.  \n82 Applying the requirements in paragraph 80 results in goodwill being tested for impairment at a level that\nreflects the way an entity manages its operations and with which the goodwill would naturally be\nassociated. Therefore, the development of additional reporting systems is typically not necessary.  \n-----  83 A cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated for the purpose of impairment testing may not\ncoincide with the level at which goodwill is allocated in accordance with AASB 121 The Effects of Changes\n_in Foreign Exchange Rates for the purpose of measuring foreign currency gains and losses. For example, if_\nan entity is required by AASB 121 to allocate goodwill to relatively low levels for the purpose of measuring\nforeign currency gains and losses, it is not required to test the goodwill for impairment at that same level\nunless it also monitors the goodwill at that level for internal management purposes.  \n**84** **If the initial allocation of goodwill acquired in a business combination cannot be completed before the**\n**end of the annual period in which the business combination is effected, that initial allocation shall be**\n**completed before the end of the first annual period beginning after the acquisition date.**  \n85 In accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations, if the initial accounting for a business combination can\nbe determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected, the acquirer:  \n(a) accounts for the combination using those provisional values; and  \n(b) recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial\naccounting within the measurement period, which will not exceed twelve months from the\nacquisition date.  \nIn such circumstances, it might also not be possible to complete the initial allocation of the goodwill\nrecognised in the combination before the end of the annual period in which the combination is effected.\nWhen this is the case, the entity discloses the information required by paragraph 133.  \n**86** **If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of an operation within**\n**that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of shall be:**  \n**(a)** **included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on**\n**disposal; and**  \n**(b)** **measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of**\n**the cash-generating unit retained, unless the entity can demonstrate that some other method**\n**better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.**",

That increase is a**\n**reversal of an impairment loss.**  \n115 A reversal of an impairment loss reflects an increase in the estimated service potential of an asset, either\nfrom use or from sale, since the date when an entity last recognised an impairment loss for that asset.\nParagraph 130 requires an entity to identify the change in estimates that causes the increase in estimated\nservice potential. Examples of changes in estimates include:  \n(a) a change in the basis for recoverable amount (ie whether recoverable amount is based on fair\nvalue less costs of disposal or value in use);  \n(b) if recoverable amount was based on value in use, a change in the amount or timing of estimated\nfuture cash flows or in the discount rate; or  \n(c) if recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs of disposal, a change in estimate of the\ncomponents of fair value less costs of disposal.  \n116 An asset\u2019s value in use may become greater than the asset\u2019s carrying amount simply because the present\nvalue of future cash inflows increases as they become closer. However, the service potential of the asset has\nnot increased. Therefore, an impairment loss is not reversed just because of the passage of time (sometimes\ncalled the \u2018unwinding\u2019 of the discount), even if the recoverable amount of the asset becomes higher than its\ncarrying amount.",

Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be doublecounted or ignored. For example, a discount rate of 12 per cent might be applied to contractual\ncash flows of a loan receivable.

In effect, the traditional\napproach assumes that a single discount rate convention can incorporate all the expectations about the\nfuture cash flows and the appropriate risk premium. Therefore, the traditional approach places most of the\nemphasis on selection of the discount rate.  \nA5 In some circumstances, such as those in which comparable assets can be observed in the marketplace, a\ntraditional approach is relatively easy to apply. For assets with contractual cash flows, it is consistent with\nthe manner in which marketplace participants describe assets, as in \u2018a 12 per cent bond\u2019.  \n-----  A6 However, the traditional approach may not appropriately address some complex measurement problems,\nsuch as the measurement of non-financial assets for which no market for the item or a comparable item\nexists. A proper search for \u2018the rate commensurate with the risk\u2019 requires analysis of at least two items\u2014an\nasset that exists in the marketplace and has an observed interest rate and the asset being measured. The\nappropriate discount rate for the cash flows being measured must be inferred from the observable rate of\ninterest in that other asset. To draw that inference, the characteristics of the other asset\u2019s cash flows must be\nsimilar to those of the asset being measured. Therefore, the measurer must do the following:  \n(a) identify the set of cash flows that will be discounted;  \n(b) identify another asset in the marketplace that appears to have similar cash flow characteristics;  \n(c) compare the cash flow sets from the two items to ensure that they are similar (for example, are\nboth sets contractual cash flows, or is one contractual and the other an estimated cash flow?);  \n(d) evaluate whether there is an element in one item that is not present in the other (for example, is\none less liquid than the other?); and  \n(e) evaluate whether both sets of cash flows are likely to behave (ie vary) in a similar fashion in\nchanging economic conditions.",

        "page_content=": "### Expected cash flow approach\nA7 The expected cash flow approach is, in some situations, a more effective measurement tool than the\ntraditional approach. In developing a measurement, the expected cash flow approach uses all expectations\nabout possible cash flows instead of the single most likely cash flow. For example, a cash flow might be\nCU100, CU200 or CU300 with probabilities of 10 per cent, 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The\nexpected cash flow is CU220. The expected cash flow approach thus differs from the traditional approach\nby focusing on direct analysis of the cash flows in question and on more explicit statements of the\nassumptions used in the measurement.  \nA8 The expected cash flow approach also allows use of present value techniques when the timing of cash flows\nis uncertain. For example, a cash flow of CU1,000 may be received in one year, two years or three years\nwith probabilities of 10 per cent, 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The example below shows the\ncomputation of expected present value in that situation.  \nPresent value of CU1,000 in 1 year at 5% CU952.38  \nProbability 10.00% CU95.24  \nPresent value of CU1,000 in 2 years at 5.25% CU902.73  \nProbability 60.00% CU541.64  \nPresent value of CU1,000 in 3 years at 5.50% CU851.61  \nProbability 30.00% CU255.48  \nExpected present value CU892.36  \nA9 The expected present value of CU892.36 differs from the traditional notion of a best estimate of CU902.73\n(the 60 per cent probability). A traditional present value computation applied to this example requires a\ndecision about which of the possible timings of cash flows to use and, accordingly, would not reflect the\nprobabilities of other timings. This is because the discount rate in a traditional present value computation\ncannot reflect uncertainties in timing.  \nA10 The use of probabilities is an essential element of the expected cash flow approach. Some question whether\nassigning probabilities to highly subjective estimates suggests greater precision than, in fact, exists.\nHowever, the proper application of the traditional approach (as described in paragraph A6) requires the\nsame estimates and subjectivity without providing the computational transparency of the expected cash flow\napproach.  \nA11 Many estimates developed in current practice already incorporate the elements of expected cash flows\ninformally. In addition, accountants often face the need to measure an asset using limited information about\nthe probabilities of possible cash flows. For example, an accountant might be confronted with the following\nsituations:  \n-----  (a) the estimated amount falls somewhere between CU50 and CU250, but no amount in the range is\nmore likely than any other amount. Based on that limited information, the estimated expected\ncash flow is CU150 [(50 + 250)/2].  \n(b) the estimated amount falls somewhere between CU50 and CU250, and the most likely amount is\nCU100. However, the probabilities attached to each amount are unknown. Based on that limited\ninformation, the estimated expected cash flow is CU133.33 [(50 + 100 + 250)/3].  \n(c) the estimated amount will be CU50 (10 per cent probability), CU250 (30 per cent probability), or\nCU100 (60 per cent probability). Based on that limited information, the estimated expected cash\nflow is CU140 [(50 \u00d7 0.10) + (250 \u00d7 0.30) + (100 \u00d7 0.60)].  \nIn each case, the estimated expected cash flow is likely to provide a better estimate of value in use than the\nminimum, most likely or maximum amount taken alone.  \nA12 The application of an expected cash flow approach is subject to a cost-benefit constraint. In some cases, an\nentity may have access to extensive data and may be able to develop many cash flow scenarios. In other\ncases, an entity may not be able to develop more than general statements about the variability of cash flows\nwithout incurring substantial cost. The entity needs to balance the cost of obtaining additional information\nagainst the additional reliability that information will bring to the measurement.  \nA13 Some maintain that expected cash flow techniques are inappropriate for measuring a single item or an item\nwith a limited number of possible outcomes. They offer an example of an asset with two possible outcomes:\na 90 per cent probability that the cash flow will be CU10 and a 10 per cent probability that the cash flow\nwill be CU1,000. They observe that the expected cash flow in that example is CU109 and criticise that\nresult as not representing either of the amounts that may ultimately be paid.  \nA14 Assertions like the one just outlined reflect underlying disagreement with the measurement objective. If the\nobjective is accumulation of costs to be incurred, expected cash flows may not produce a representationally\nfaithful estimate of the expected cost. However, this Standard is concerned with measuring the recoverable\namount of an asset. The recoverable amount of the asset in this example is not likely to be CU10, even\nthough that is the most likely cash flow. This is because a measurement of CU10 does not incorporate the\nuncertainty of the cash flow in the measurement of the asset. Instead, the uncertain cash flow is presented as\nif it were a certain cash flow. No rational entity would sell an asset with these characteristics for CU10.",

The purpose is to estimate, as far as possible, a market assessment of:  \n(a) the time value of money for the periods until the end of the asset\u2019s useful life; and  \n(b) factors (b), (d) and (e) described in paragraph A1, to the extent those factors have not caused\nadjustments in arriving at estimated cash flows.  \nA17 As a starting point in making such an estimate, the entity might take into account the following rates:  \n(a) the entity\u2019s weighted average cost of capital determined using techniques such as the Capital\nAsset Pricing Model;  \n(b) the entity\u2019s incremental borrowing rate; and  \n(c) other market borrowing rates.  \nA18 However, these rates must be adjusted:  \n(a) to reflect the way that the market would assess the specific risks associated with the asset\u2019s\nestimated cash flows; and  \n(b) to exclude risks that are not relevant to the asset\u2019s estimated cash flows or for which the estimated\ncash flows have been adjusted.  \nConsideration should be given to risks such as country risk, currency risk and price risk.  \nA19 The discount rate is independent of the entity\u2019s capital structure and the way the entity financed the\npurchase of the asset, because the future cash flows expected to arise from an asset do not depend on the\nway in which the entity financed the purchase of the asset.  \n-----  A20 Paragraph 55 requires the discount rate used to be a pre-tax rate. Therefore, when the basis used to estimate\nthe discount rate is post-tax, that basis is adjusted to reflect a pre-tax rate.  \nA21 An entity normally uses a single discount rate for the estimate of an asset\u2019s value in use. However, an entity\nuses separate discount rates for different future periods where value in use is sensitive to a difference in\nrisks for different periods or to the term structure of interest rates.  \n-----  ",

Units A, B and C and operation XYZ each represent the lowest level within M at\nwhich the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  \n-----  IE81 M acquired unit C, a manufacturing operation in North America, in December 20X2. Unlike M\u2019s other\nNorth American operations, C operates in an industry with high margins and high growth rates, and with the\nbenefit of a 10-year patent on its primary product. The patent was granted to C just before M\u2019s acquisition\nof C. As part of accounting for the acquisition of C, M recognised, in addition to the patent, goodwill of\nCU3,000 and a brand name of CU1,000. M\u2019s management has determined that the brand name has an\nindefinite useful life. M has no other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.  \nIE82 The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to units A, B\nand C and to operation XYZ are as follows:  \n_Goodwill_ _Intangible assets with_  \n_indefinite useful lives_",

The recoverable amounts (ie higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) of\nthose units and group of units are determined on the basis of value in use calculations. M has determined\nthat the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes in the following assumptions:  \n|Units A and B|Unit C|Operation XYZ|\n|---|---|---|\n|Gross margin during the budget period (budget period is 4 years)|5-year US government bond rate during the budget period (budget period is 5 years)|Gross margin during the budget period (budget period is 5 years)|\n|Raw materials price inflation during the budget period|Raw materials price inflation during the budget period|Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate during the budget period|\n|Market share during the budget period|Market share during the budget period|Market share during the budget period|\n|Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period|Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period|Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period|  \nIE84 Gross margins during the budget period for A, B and XYZ are estimated by M based on average gross\nmargins achieved in the period immediately before the start of the budget period, increased by 5 per cent\nper year for anticipated efficiency improvements. A and B produce complementary products and are\noperated by M to achieve the same gross margins.  \nIE85 Market shares during the budget period are estimated by M based on average market shares achieved in the\nperiod immediately before the start of the budget period, adjusted each year for any anticipated growth or\ndecline in market shares. M anticipates that:  \n(a) market shares for A and B will differ, but will each grow during the budget period by 3 per cent\nper year as a result of ongoing improvements in product quality.  \n(b) C\u2019s market share will grow during the budget period by 6 per cent per year as a result of\nincreased advertising expenditure and the benefits from the protection of the 10-year patent on its\nprimary product.  \n-----  (c) XYZ\u2019s market share will remain unchanged during the budget period as a result of the\ncombination of ongoing improvements in product quality and an anticipated increase in\ncompetition.  \nIE86 A and B purchase raw materials from the same European suppliers, whereas C\u2019s raw materials are\npurchased from various North American suppliers. Raw materials price inflation during the budget period is\nestimated by M to be consistent with forecast consumer price indices published by government agencies in\nthe relevant European and North American countries.  \nIE87 The 5-year US government bond rate during the budget period is estimated by M to be consistent with the\nyield on such bonds at the beginning of the budget period. The Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate is\nestimated by M to be consistent with the average market forward exchange rate over the budget period.  \nIE88 M uses steady growth rates to extrapolate beyond the budget period cash flows for A, B, C and XYX. The\ngrowth rates for A, B and XYZ are estimated by M to be consistent with publicly available information\nabout the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which A, B and XYZ operate. However, the\ngrowth rate for C exceeds the long-term average growth rate for the market in which C operates. M\u2019s\nmanagement is of the opinion that this is reasonable in the light of the protection of the 10-year patent on\nC\u2019s primary product.  \nIE89 M includes the following disclosure in the notes to its financial statements for the year ending 31 December\n20X3.  \n_Impairment Tests for Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives_  \nGoodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three individual cash-generating units\u2014two\nin Europe (units A and B) and one in North America (unit C)\u2014and to one group of cash-generating units\n(comprising operation XYZ) in Asia. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to unit C and operation\nXYZ is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill, but the carrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to each of units A and B is not. Nevertheless, the recoverable amounts of units A and B\nare based on some of the same key assumptions, and the aggregate carrying amount of goodwill allocated to\nthose units is significant.  \n_Operation XYZ_  \nThe recoverable amount of operation XYZ has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That\ncalculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a fiveyear period, and a discount rate of 8.4 per cent. Cash flows beyond that five-year period have been\nextrapolated using a steady 6.3 per cent growth rate. This growth rate does not exceed the long-term\naverage growth rate for the market in which XYZ operates. Management believes that any reasonably\npossible change in the key assumptions on which XYZ\u2019s recoverable amount is based would _not_ cause\nXYZ\u2019s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.  \n_Unit C_  \nThe recoverable amount of unit C has also been determined based on a value in use calculation. That\ncalculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a fiveyear period, and a discount rate of 9.2 per cent. C\u2019s cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated\nusing a steady 12 per cent growth rate. This growth rate exceeds by 4 percentage points the long-term\naverage growth rate for the market in which C operates. However, C benefits from the protection of a 10year patent on its primary product, granted in December 20X2. Management believes that a 12 per cent\ngrowth rate is reasonable in the light of that patent. Management also believes that any reasonably possible\nchange in the key assumptions on which C\u2019s recoverable amount is based would _not_ cause C\u2019s carrying\namount to exceed its recoverable amount.  \n_Units A and B_  \nThe recoverable amounts of units A and B have been determined on the basis of value in use calculations.\nThose units produce complementary products, and their recoverable amounts are based on some of the same\nkey assumptions. Both value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets\napproved by management covering a four-year period, and a discount rate of 7.9 per cent. Both sets of cash\nflows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a steady 5 per cent growth rate. This growth rate\ndoes not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which A and B operate. Cash flow\nprojections during the budget period for both A and B are also based on the same expected gross margins\nduring the budget period and the same raw materials price inflation during the budget period. Management\nbelieves that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not cause the aggregate\ncarrying amount of A and B to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of those units.  \n-----  _Operation XYZ_ _Unit C_ _Units A and B_\n_(in aggregate)_  \nCarrying amount of\ngoodwill CU1,200 CU3,000 CU800  \nCarrying amount of\nbrand name with\nindefinite useful life \u2013 CU1,000 \u2013",

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC2 Under AASB 136 _Impairment of Assets (July 2004 and August 2015), an impairment loss is the amount by_\nwhich the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The\nrecoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal\n(\u2018net fair value\u2019) and its value in use.  \nBC3 Paragraph Aus32.1 to AASB 136, required not-for-profit (NFP) entities to determine the value in use of an\nasset as its depreciated replacement cost (DRC) when the future economic benefits of the asset are not\nprimarily dependent on the asset\u2019s ability to generate net cash inflows and where the entity would, if deprived\nof the asset, replace its remaining future economic benefits. Paragraph Aus6.2 to AASB 136 defined DRC as\n\u201cthe current replacement cost of an asset less, where applicable, accumulated depreciation calculated on the\nbasis of such cost to reflect the already consumed or expired future economic benefits of the asset\u201d. Paragraph\nAus32.2 explained that \u201cThe current replacement cost of an asset is its cost measured by reference to the\nlowest cost at which the gross future economic benefits of that asset could currently be obtained in the normal\ncourse of business\u201d.  \nBC4 The AASB previously concluded that the Aus paragraphs were needed in AASB 136 to help ensure\nimpairments are not recognised for non-cash-generating assets held by NFP entities when they still embody\nfuture economic benefits of a value equal to, or greater than, their carrying amounts. This was based on the\nview that entities might inappropriately recognise impairment due to the focus of IAS 36 Impairment of\n_Assets, which is incorporated into AASB 136, on cash-generating assets. The value in use of a non-cash-_\ngenerating asset based on cash flows would be zero or close to zero and the net fair value of the asset could be\nregarded as relating to a scrap value for a specialised asset.",

        "page_content=": "## The need to issue AASB 2016-4  \nBC5 Clarifications were sought by some constituents about the interaction between the notion of DRC for\ndetermining the value in use of assets held by NFP entities in the circumstances described in paragraph BC3\nand the notion of current replacement cost (CRC) as a measure of the fair value of an asset under the cost\napproach in AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement. AASB 13 (paragraphs B8 and B9) identifies the cost_\napproach as a valuation technique for measuring fair value. Under AASB 13, the cost approach reflects the\namount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset.  \nBC6 Some commentators argued that, consistent with the role of CRC as a measure of fair value under AASB 13\n(reflecting the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset), DRC should not be an\nentity-specific measure of recoverable amount under AASB 136. These commentators supported the objective\nof the existing requirements of AASB 136 of not basing the recoverable amount of primarily non-cashgenerating assets held by NFP entities on discounted cash flows. They also noted that when DRC was\nincluded in AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment (July 2004), there was ambiguity as to whether it was\na measure of fair value or a measure of value in use and that with the publication of AASB 13 and its\nexposition of the cost approach, it became clear that DRC under the AASB 116 is a measure of fair value as is\nCRC under AASB 13. Accordingly, for such assets, they argued that DRC should be used to determine fair\nvalue as a measure of recoverable amount and noted that its designation as a measure of value in use under\nAASB 136 might be a source of confusion.  \nBC7 Other commentators argued that DRC is identified as a measure of fair value in paragraph 33 to AASB 116\n(July 2004), in cases where there is no market-based evidence of fair value because of the specialised nature\nof the asset and the item is rarely sold, except as part of a continuing business. They noted that, with the  \n-----  publication of AASB 13, the cost approach plays a similar role as a measure of fair value when the market\nand income approaches to valuation are not applicable due to the specialised nature of the asset.  \nBC8 Further comments on the interaction between DRC under AASB 136 and CRC under AASB 13 were sought\nin AASB outreach with key stakeholders, such as preparers and auditors, and valuers of NFP entities\u2019 assets,\nparticularly in regard to assets held by public sector entities.  \nBC9 Comments from some preparers in the public sector who participated in the outreach indicated that separate\nevaluations of CRC as a measure of fair value under AASB 13 and DRC as a measure of value in use under\nAASB 136 are not usually performed. These commentators noted that, although CRC as a measure of fair\nvalue under AASB 13 and DRC as a measure of value in use under AASB 136 are different in concept, for\nspecialised assets where the market is typically inactive, the highest and best use is generally their current use.\nAccordingly, in their view the CRC of such assets under AASB 13 and their DRC under AASB 136 are, in\npractice, interchangeable. Some noted one reason for this outcome is that highest and best use requires\nconsideration of reasonably possible uses, not every possible use.  \nBC10 Some valuers participating in staff outreach noted:  \n(a) in the case of a NFP entity where the fair value of a specialised asset is based on the cost approach,\nthe entity acts as the \u2018buyer\u2019 and is competing with other market participants in order to acquire the\nasset. They argue that this means CRC under AASB 13 should not be different from DRC under\nAASB 136;  \n(b) CRC under AASB 13 and DRC under AASB 136 are regarded as similar measures of fair value and\nthe existing use or alternative uses are considered and assessed on a case-by-case basis; and  \n(c) the highest and best use of an asset determines its fair value, but restrictions (such as legal\nrestrictions) on the use of an asset often mean that the highest and best use of an asset is its current\nuse.",

        "page_content=": "## The AASB\u2019s initial deliberations  \nBC11 The AASB noted that DRC is identified as a measure of fair value in paragraph 33 to AASB 116 (July 2004)  \nin cases where there is no market-based evidence of fair value because of the specialised nature of the asset\nand the item is rarely sold, except as part of a continuing business. The AASB also noted that, with the\npublication of AASB 13, CRC plays a similar role for assets that are specialised in nature and are rarely sold,\nsuch as many assets held by public sector entities. The AASB further noted that the cost of disposal of such\nassets is not expected to be material.  \nBC12 The AASB noted that fair value under AASB 13 is defined as an exit price. Therefore, CRC under AASB 13  \nis conceptually different from DRC as a measure of value in use under AASB 136, being an entry price. The\nAASB noted, however, that:  \n(a) the description of the cost approach in AASB 13 indicates that CRC incorporates obsolescence as\ndoes the definition of DRC under AASB 136, where accumulated depreciation encompasses\nobsolescence;  \n(b) valuers use similar approaches in determining DRC and CRC. Factors such as physical obsolescence,\nfunctional obsolescence and economic obsolescence are all considered in determining each measure;\nand  \n(c) valuers\u2019 practice involves considering as a starting point whether the valuation is of a specialised\nasset in its current use or an alternative use and whether there are any restrictions on the use of the\nasset.  \nBC13 The AASB concluded that DRC as a measure of value in use of specialised assets that are rarely sold is  \nunlikely to be materially different from DRC (or CRC) as a measure of fair value of such assets. This is\nbecause, for non-cash-generating specialised assets, the market is typically inactive and their highest and best\nuses would usually be their current uses rather than their sale, resulting in CRC of such assets being not\nmaterially different from their DRC, as the following example shows:  \n**_Example_**  \nAn entity self-constructs a specialised facility. Because this is the entity\u2019s specific practice in its industry, it can\nconstruct the facility for $8.5 million, whereas the cost of construction of the facility to any other market participant\nwould be $10 million. As the construction of the facility has just been completed, there is no obsolescence or\ndepreciation.  \n-----  The issues are: (a) whether the CRC of the facility should be measured at $10 million or $8.5m under AASB 13;\nand (b) whether the DRC of the facility should be measured at $10m or $8.5m under AASB 136.  \n**_Analysis_**  \nParagraph B9 to AASB 13 states that \u201ca market participant buyer would not pay more for an asset than the amount\nfor which it could replace the service capacity of that asset\u201d. The implication of that statement depends on whether\nthe market participant buyer includes, or has the attributes of, the vendor. Paragraph BC78 of the IASB\u2019s Basis for\nConclusions on IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement states that, in relation to a specialised non-financial asset, \u201cIn\neffect, the market participant buyer _steps into the shoes of the entity that holds that specialised asset\u201d (emphasis_\nadded). Based on that comment, it seems appropriate in the above example to regard the market participant buyer as\nbeing capable of self-constructing the asset for $8.5 million, in which case CRC should be measured at $8.5 million\nunder AASB 13. Because value in use is an entity-specific measure, the DRC of the facility would also be measured\nat $8.5 million under AASB 136.  \nBC14 The AASB noted that, when the AASB 136 impairment model (as per IAS 36) is applied to non-cash\ngenerating specialised assets that are rarely sold, the value in use of the asset is typically less than its net fair\nvalue because the asset is generally held for continuing use of its service capacity, not the generation of cash\ninflows. Further, because these assets are rarely sold, their cost of disposal is typically negligible. The AASB\nconcluded that, in such circumstances, the recoverable amount of the asset would be materially the same as\nfair value determined under AASB 13.  \nBC15 The AASB noted that AASB 13 has addressed the concerns identified in paragraph BC4 above that the net  \nfair value of an asset could be regarded as relating to a scrap value for a specialised asset leading to an\ninappropriate recognition of impairment. Paragraph BC78 of the IASB\u2019s Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 13\nrefers to the concerns that an exit price would be based on scrap value (particularly given the requirement to\nmaximise the use of observable inputs, such as market prices) and not reflect the value that an entity expects\nto generate by using the asset in its operations. It notes that, in such circumstances, the scrap value for an\nindividual asset would be irrelevant because an exit price reflects the sale of the asset to a market participant\nthat has, or can obtain, the complementary assets and the associated liabilities needed to use the specialised\nasset in its own operations. In effect, the market participant buyer steps into the shoes of the entity that holds\nthat specialised asset.  \nBC16 The AASB noted that, with the issuance of AASB 13, the fair value of non-financial assets is determined  \nunder that Standard. Accordingly, with the CRC measure being available under AASB 13, the notion of DRC\nincluded in AASB 116 (July 2004) would no longer be applicable in estimating the fair value of specialised\nnon-financial assets.",

        "page_content=": "## Clarifying CRC  \nBC21 Some valuation industry participants consulted in AASB outreach were of the view that some constituents  \ncontinue to see CRC under AASB 13 as the gross replacement cost of a new asset rather than the CRC of the\nremaining service capacity of the asset. The AASB observed that:  \n(a) paragraph B8 to AASB 13 describes CRC as the amount that would be required currently to replace\nthe service capacity of an asset. This is a reference to replacement cost of the service capacity of the\nasset and not a new asset; and  \n(b) paragraph B9 to AASB 13 further clarifies that the price that would be received for the asset is based\non the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable\nutility, adjusted for obsolescence and that obsolescence encompasses physical deterioration,\nfunctional (technological) obsolescence and economic (external) obsolescence.  \nBC22 The AASB concluded that the description of CRC in AASB 13 is clear that CRC is not a gross value  \nreflecting the replacement cost of a new asset, rather it is replacement cost of the remaining service capacity\nof the asset.  \nBC23 The AASB also confirmed its view that DRC under AASB 136 is equivalent to CRC under AASB 13. It was  \nnoted that the description of the cost approach in AASB 13 indicates that CRC incorporates obsolescence as\ndid the definition of DRC under AASB 136, where accumulated depreciation encompasses obsolescence. It\nalso noted that valuation industry participants in AASB outreach generally were of the view that the\ndescription of CRC in AASB 13 is consistent with their current valuation practice for determining DRC under\na cost approach in that the replacement cost or reproduction cost of a new equivalent asset is adjusted for all\nrelevant types of obsolescence and the issue of overcapacity is also considered in arriving at an optimised\nvalue.  \nBC24 Some commentators noted that the capitalisation of borrowing costs assumed in the example in paragraph  \nBC14 to ED 269 was not common for NFP public sector entities because the ABS GFS Manual prohibits\ncapitalisation of borrowing costs. The AASB noted that capitalisation of borrowing costs would need to be\naddressed as part of another project.",

        "page_content=": "## Disposal costs associated with specialised assets  \nBC25 Some participants in AASB outreach noted the costs of disposal might not be negligible in some cases where  \nnon-cash-generating specialised assets are involved. Some had in mind a range of costs they considered\npotentially material that could be associated with making an asset saleable. As an example, they noted those\ncosts might include material costs of rezoning land.  \nBC26 The AASB noted that IFRS 13, Illustrative Example 8, clarifies the type of costs that would need to be  \nconsidered in determining the fair value of assets. In illustrating the determination of highest and best use, the\nexample contrasts the value of land currently developed for industrial use with the land as a vacant site for\nresidential use. In identifying the fair value of the land as a vacant site for residential use it considers the costs\nof demolishing the factory and other costs necessary to convert the land to a vacant site.  \nBC27 The AASB noted that disposal costs are costs incurred to sell the asset in its existing state (target asset). The  \nAASB confirmed that, consistent with the example noted in paragraph BC26, costs incurred to enhance the\nuse of an asset, change its nature, or make it marketable would be considered in fair valuing the enhanced\nasset. Such costs would not be disposal costs of the target asset for the purpose of calculating net fair value.\nAccordingly, land rezoned for residential or commercial use is a different asset from land with zoning as\npublic land and costs such as decommissioning costs or rezoning costs that change the nature of the asset are\nnot classified as disposal costs of the land in its public use.  \nBC28 The AASB also noted that disposal costs are \u2018normal\u2019 incremental costs directly attributable to disposal of an  \nasset and are not intended to include excessive costs arising from the processes to sell particular assets.",

        "page_content=": "## Impairment of revalued assets  \nBC29 Some commentators expressed the view that it was not sufficiently clear whether the proposed  \nparagraph Aus5.1 would apply only to NFP entities as it does not explicitly preclude application by for-profit\nentities. The AASB confirmed that paragraph Aus5.1 would apply only to primarily non-cash-generating  \n-----  specialised assets of NFP entities held for their service capacity and would not apply to assets of for-profit\nentities whether or not held for their service capacity.  \nBC30 Some participants in AASB outreach commented that ED 269 is not clear as to whether it would mean that  \nconsideration does not need to be had to whether revalued assets of NFP entities would still need to be tested\nfor impairment if an impairment trigger were present.  \nBC31 The AASB noted that the objective of removing references to DRC from AASB 136 and determining  \nrecoverable amount as fair value is to reduce financial reporting costs to NFP entities holding specialised\nassets that are held for continuing use of their service capacity. The AASB considered that this is consistent\nwith its Process for Modifying IFRSs for NFPs which notes that \u201cIn some cases, the context or increased or\nreduced prevalence of a transaction or event for PBE/NFP as compared with for-profit entities, may require\nmodifications to the relevant IFRS to ensure that user needs are met while considering the balance between\ncosts and benefits\u201d. The AASB noted that revaluation of non-financial assets in the Australian NFP public\nsector is more prevalent than in the for-profit sector. The AASB concluded that when non-cash-generating\nspecialised assets of NFP entities that are held for the continuing use of their service capacity are revalued\nregularly to fair value under the revaluation model in AASB 116 and AASB 138 Intangible Assets, the entity\nno longer applies AASB 136 to such assets. This is because regular revaluation ensures such assets are carried\nat an amount that is not materially different from fair value and any impairment would be taken into account\nas part of revaluation. For such assets, the issue of determining recoverable amount of the asset and\nmagnitude of disposal costs would not be relevant.  \nBC32 The AASB noted that an entity holding an asset with the intention of selling it would need to apply AASB 5  \n_Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and AASB 136 would not apply._  \nBC33 The AASB decided to proceed with the ED 269 proposals with amendments based on the conclusion noted in  \nparagraph BC31.  \nBC34 The AASB noted that AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and AASB 108 Accounting Policies,  \n_Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors would apply in implementing the amendments and in respect of_\ncomparative information. The AASB also noted that it would not expect the amendments to AASB 136 to\nchange current practice materially.  \n-----  ",
