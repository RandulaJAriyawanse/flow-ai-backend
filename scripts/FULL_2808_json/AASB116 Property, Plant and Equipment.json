Such items of property, plant and equipment\nqualify for recognition as assets because they enable an entity to derive future economic benefits from\nrelated assets in excess of what could be derived had those items not been acquired. For example, a\nchemical manufacturer may install new chemical handling processes to comply with environmental\nrequirements for the production and storage of dangerous chemicals; related plant enhancements are\nrecognised as an asset because without them the entity is unable to manufacture and sell chemicals.\nHowever, the resulting carrying amount of such an asset and related assets is reviewed for impairment in\naccordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.",

Rather, these costs\nare recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Costs of day-to-day servicing are primarily the costs of labour\nand consumables, and may include the cost of small parts. The purpose of these expenditures is often\ndescribed as for the \u2018repairs and maintenance\u2019 of the item of property, plant and equipment.  \n13 Parts of some items of property, plant and equipment may require replacement at regular intervals. For\nexample, a furnace may require relining after a specified number of hours of use, or aircraft interiors such as\nseats and galleys may require replacement several times during the life of the airframe. Items of property,\nplant and equipment may also be acquired to make a less frequently recurring replacement, such as\nreplacing the interior walls of a building, or to make a nonrecurring replacement. Under the recognition\nprinciple in paragraph 7, an entity recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and\nequipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are\nmet.

        "page_content=": "## Elements of cost  \n16 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:  \n(a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting\ntrade discounts and rebates.  \n(b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to\nbe capable of operating in the manner intended by management.  \n(c) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on\nwhich it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as\na consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to\nproduce inventories during that period.  \n17 Examples of directly attributable costs are:  \n(a) costs of employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits) arising directly from the\nconstruction or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment;  \n(b) costs of site preparation;  \n(c) initial delivery and handling costs;  \n(d) installation and assembly costs;  \n(e) costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly (ie assessing whether the technical and\nphysical performance of the asset is such that it is capable of being used in the production or\nsupply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes); and  \n(f) professional fees.  \n18 An entity applies AASB 102 Inventories to the costs of obligations for dismantling, removing and restoring\nthe site on which an item is located that are incurred during a particular period as a consequence of having\nused the item to produce inventories during that period. The obligations for costs accounted for in\naccordance with AASB 102 or AASB 116 are recognised and measured in accordance with AASB 137\n_Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets._  \n19 Examples of costs that are not costs of an item of property, plant and equipment are:  \n(a) costs of opening a new facility;  \n(b) costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional\nactivities);  \n(c) costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including costs of\nstaff training); and  \n(d) administration and other general overhead costs.  \n20 Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment ceases when the\nitem is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by\nmanagement. Therefore, costs incurred in using or redeploying an item are not included in the carrying\namount of that item. For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an item of\nproperty, plant and equipment:  \n(a) costs incurred while an item capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet\nto be brought into use or is operated at less than full capacity;  \n(b) initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the item\u2019s output builds up; and  \n(c) costs of relocating or reorganising part or all of an entity\u2019s operations.  \n20A Items may be produced while bringing an item of property, plant and equipment to the location and\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management (such as\nsamples produced when testing whether the asset is functioning properly). An entity recognises the\nproceeds from selling any such items, and the cost of those items, in profit or loss in accordance with\napplicable Standards. The entity measures the cost of those items applying the measurement requirements\nof AASB 102.  \n-----  21 Some operations occur in connection with the construction or development of an item of property, plant and\nequipment, but are not necessary to bring the item to the location and condition necessary for it to be\ncapable of operating in the manner intended by management. These incidental operations may occur before\nor during the construction or development activities. For example, income may be earned through using a\nbuilding site as a car park until construction starts. Because incidental operations are not necessary to bring\nan item to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by\nmanagement, the income and related expenses of incidental operations are recognised in profit or loss and\nincluded in their respective classifications of income and expense.  \n22 The cost of a self-constructed asset is determined using the same principles as for an acquired asset. If an\nentity makes similar assets for sale in the normal course of business, the cost of the asset is usually the same\nas the cost of constructing an asset for sale (see AASB 102). Therefore, any internal profits are eliminated\nin arriving at such costs. Similarly, the cost of abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour, or other\nresources incurred in self-constructing an asset is not included in the cost of the asset. AASB 123\n_Borrowing Costs establishes criteria for the recognition of interest as a component of the carrying amount of_\na self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment.  \n22A Bearer plants are accounted for in the same way as self-constructed items of property, plant and equipment\nbefore they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by\nmanagement. Consequently, references to \u2018construction\u2019 in this Standard should be read as covering\nactivities that are necessary to cultivate the bearer plants before they are in the location and condition\nnecessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.",

        "page_content=": "## Measurement of cost  \n23 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is the cash price equivalent at the recognition date. If\npayment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between the cash price equivalent and the\ntotal payment is recognised as interest over the period of credit unless such interest is capitalised in\naccordance with AASB 123.  \n24 One or more items of property, plant and equipment may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset\nor assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. The following discussion refers simply to\nan exchange of one non-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the\npreceding sentence. The cost of such an item of property, plant and equipment is measured at fair value\nunless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset\nreceived nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. The acquired item is measured in this way even if an\nentity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up. If the acquired item is not measured at fair value,\nits cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.  \n25 An entity determines whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance by considering the extent\nto which its future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An exchange transaction\nhas commercial substance if:  \n(a) the configuration (risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from\nthe configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred; or  \n(b) the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity\u2019s operations affected by the transaction\nchanges as a result of the exchange; and  \n(c) the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged.  \nFor the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entityspecific value of the portion of the entity\u2019s operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash\nflows. The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations.  \n26 The fair value of an asset is reliably measurable if (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value\nmeasurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the\nrange can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring fair value. If an entity is able to measure\nreliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given\nup is used to measure the cost of the asset received unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly\nevident.  \n27 [Deleted]  \n28 The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment may be reduced by government grants in\naccordance with AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance.  \n-----  ",

Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does**\n**not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting**\n**period.**  \n32\u2013\n33 [Deleted]  \n34 The frequency of revaluations depends upon the changes in fair values of the items of property, plant and\nequipment being revalued. When the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying\namount, a further revaluation is required. Some items of property, plant and equipment experience\nsignificant and volatile changes in fair value, thus necessitating annual revaluation. Such frequent\nrevaluations are unnecessary for items of property, plant and equipment with only insignificant changes in\nfair value. Instead, it may be necessary to revalue the item only every three or five years.  \n35 When an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, the carrying amount of that asset is adjusted to\nthe revalued amount. At the date of the revaluation, the asset is treated in one of the following ways:  \n(a) the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the\ncarrying amount of the asset. For example, the gross carrying amount may be restated by\nreference to observable market data or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the\ncarrying amount. The accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal\nthe difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after\ntaking into account accumulated impairment losses; or  \n(b) the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.  \nThe amount of the adjustment of accumulated depreciation forms part of the increase or decrease in\ncarrying amount that is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 39, Aus39.1, 40, Aus40.1 and\nAus40.2.  \n**36** **If an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant and**\n**equipment to which that asset belongs shall be revalued.**  \n37 A class of property, plant and equipment is a grouping of assets of a similar nature and use in an entity\u2019s\noperations. The following are examples of separate classes:  \n(a) land;  \n(b) land and buildings;  \n(c) machinery;  \n-----  (d) ships;  \n(e) aircraft;  \n(f) motor vehicles;  \n(g) furniture and fixtures;  \n(h) office equipment; and  \n(i) bearer plants.  \n38 The items within a class of property, plant and equipment are revalued simultaneously to avoid selective\nrevaluation of assets and the reporting of amounts in the financial statements that are a mixture of costs and\nvalues as at different dates. However, a class of assets may be revalued on a rolling basis provided\nrevaluation of the class of assets is completed within a short period and provided the revaluations are kept\nup to date.  \n**39** **If an asset\u2019s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised**\n**in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.**\n**However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation**\n**decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.**  \n**Aus39.1** **Notwithstanding paragraph 39, in respect of not-for-profit entities, if the carrying amount**\n**of a class of assets is increased as a result of a revaluation, the net revaluation increase shall**\n**be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading**\n**of revaluation surplus.

However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income**\n**to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.

This may involve transferring the\nwhole of the surplus when the asset is retired or disposed of. However, some of the surplus may be\ntransferred as the asset is used by an entity. In such a case, the amount of the surplus transferred would be\nthe difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation\nbased on the asset\u2019s original cost. Transfers from revaluation surplus to retained earnings are not made\nthrough profit or loss.  \n42 The effects of taxes on income, if any, resulting from the revaluation of property, plant and equipment are\nrecognised and disclosed in accordance with AASB 112 Income Taxes.",

For example, it may be appropriate to\ndepreciate separately the airframe and engines of an aircraft. Similarly, if an entity acquires property, plant\nand equipment subject to an operating lease in which it is the lessor, it may be appropriate to depreciate\nseparately amounts reflected in the cost of that item that are attributable to favourable or unfavourable lease\nterms relative to market terms.  \n-----  45 A significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment may have a useful life and a depreciation\nmethod that are the same as the useful life and the depreciation method of another significant part of that\nsame item. Such parts may be grouped in determining the depreciation charge.  \n46 To the extent that an entity depreciates separately some parts of an item of property, plant and equipment, it\nalso depreciates separately the remainder of the item. The remainder consists of the parts of the item that are\nindividually not significant. If an entity has varying expectations for these parts, approximation techniques\nmay be necessary to depreciate the remainder in a manner that faithfully represents the consumption pattern\nand/or useful life of its parts.  \n47 An entity may choose to depreciate separately the parts of an item that do not have a cost that is significant\nin relation to the total cost of the item.  \n**48** **The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss unless it is included in**\n**the carrying amount of another asset.**  \n49 The depreciation charge for a period is usually recognised in profit or loss. However, sometimes, the future\neconomic benefits embodied in an asset are absorbed in producing other assets. In this case, the depreciation\ncharge constitutes part of the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount. For example, the\ndepreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment is included in the costs of conversion of inventories (see\nAASB 102). Similarly, depreciation of property, plant and equipment used for development activities may\nbe included in the cost of an intangible asset recognised in accordance with AASB 138 Intangible Assets.",

Repair and maintenance of an asset do not\nnegate the need to depreciate it.  \n53 The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. In practice, the residual\nvalue of an asset is often insignificant and therefore immaterial in the calculation of the depreciable amount.  \n54 The residual value of an asset may increase to an amount equal to or greater than the asset\u2019s carrying\namount. If it does, the asset\u2019s depreciation charge is zero unless and until its residual value subsequently\ndecreases to an amount below the asset\u2019s carrying amount.  \n55 Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition\nnecessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset\nceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group\nthat is classified as held for sale) in accordance with AASB 5 and the date that the asset is derecognised.\nTherefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the\nasset is fully depreciated. However, under usage methods of depreciation the depreciation charge can be\nzero while there is no production.  \n56 The future economic benefits embodied in an asset are consumed by an entity principally through its use.\nHowever, other factors, such as technical or commercial obsolescence and wear and tear while an asset\nremains idle, often result in the diminution of the economic benefits that might have been obtained from the\nasset. Consequently, all the following factors are considered in determining the useful life of an asset:  \n(a) expected usage of the asset. Usage is assessed by reference to the asset\u2019s expected capacity or\nphysical output.  \n(b) expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as the number of\nshifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair and maintenance programme, and the care\nand maintenance of the asset while idle.  \n(c) technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in production, or\nfrom a change in the market demand for the product or service output of the asset. Expected\nfuture reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate\nthe expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect\na reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.  \n(d) legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related leases.  \n-----  57 The useful life of an asset is defined in terms of the asset\u2019s expected utility to the entity. The asset\nmanagement policy of the entity may involve the disposal of assets after a specified time or after\nconsumption of a specified proportion of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Therefore, the\nuseful life of an asset may be shorter than its economic life. The estimation of the useful life of the asset is a\nmatter of judgement based on the experience of the entity with similar assets.  \n58 Land and buildings are separable assets and are accounted for separately, even when they are acquired\ntogether. With some exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an unlimited useful life\nand therefore is not depreciated. Buildings have a limited useful life and therefore are depreciable assets. An\nincrease in the value of the land on which a building stands does not affect the determination of the\ndepreciable amount of the building.  \n59 If the cost of land includes the costs of site dismantlement, removal and restoration, that portion of the land\nasset is depreciated over the period of benefits obtained by incurring those costs. In some cases, the land\nitself may have a limited useful life, in which case it is depreciated in a manner that reflects the benefits to\nbe derived from it.",

These methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing\nbalance method and the units of production method. Straight-line depreciation results in a constant charge\nover the useful life if the asset\u2019s residual value does not change. The diminishing balance method results in\na decreasing charge over the useful life. The units of production method results in a charge based on the\nexpected use or output. The entity selects the method that most closely reflects the expected pattern of\nconsumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. That method is applied consistently\nfrom period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future\neconomic benefits.  \n62A A depreciation method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an\nasset is not appropriate. The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally\nreflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits of the asset. For example, revenue is\naffected by other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes and prices. The price\ncomponent of revenue may be affected by inflation, which has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is\nconsumed.",

It depends on the circumstances as to whether the reliable\nmeasurement recognition criterion can be satisfied in relation to a particular heritage or cultural asset.\nHeritage and cultural assets acquired for consideration that is significantly less than fair value principally to\nenable the entity to further its objectives are required to be initially recognised at fair value as at the date of\nacquisition. Depending on circumstances, it may not be possible to reliably measure the fair value as at the\ndate of acquisition of a heritage or cultural asset.  \nG2 Of those heritage and cultural assets that satisfy the reliable measurement criterion for initial recognition\npurposes, paragraph 29 of AASB 116 permits, but does not require, revaluation. However, under\nAASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting, GGSs and whole\nof governments are required to adopt those optional treatments in Australian Accounting Standards that are\naligned with the principles or rules in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Government Finance Statistics\n(GFS) Manual. Consequently, those entities would be required to adopt a revaluation model for heritage and\ncultural assets recognised under AASB 116 where the reliable measurement recognition criterion is\nsatisfied.  \nG3 Furthermore, given the nature of many heritage and cultural assets that meet the recognition criteria, those\nassets may not have limited useful lives (for example, when the entity adopts appropriate curatorial and\npreservation policies), and therefore may not be subject to depreciation. However, entities should consider\nwhether the requirements of AASB 136 Impairment of Assets apply to such assets.  \nG4 The curatorial and preservation policies referred to in paragraph G3 above would typically be those\ndeveloped and monitored by qualified personnel and include the following:  \n(a) a clearly stated objective about the holding and preservation of items;  \n(b) a well-developed plan to achieve the objective, including demonstration of how the policy will be\nimplemented, based on advice by appropriately qualified experts;  \n(c) monitoring procedures; and  \n(d) periodic reviews.  \nIn addition, there would be evidence that the policies have been adopted by the governing body of the\nentity.  \n-----  ",
