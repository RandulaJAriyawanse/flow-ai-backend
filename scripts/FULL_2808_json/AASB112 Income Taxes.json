        "page_content=": "## Accounting Standard AASB 112 Income Taxes  \nObjective  \nThe objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for income taxes. The principal issue\nin accounting for income taxes is how to account for the current and future tax consequences of:  \n(a) the future recovery (settlement) of the carrying amount of assets (liabilities) that are recognised in\nan entity\u2019s statement of financial position; and  \n(b) transactions and other events of the current period that are recognised in an entity\u2019s financial\nstatements.  \nIt is inherent in the recognition of an asset or liability that the reporting entity expects to recover or settle the\ncarrying amount of that asset or liability. If it is probable that recovery or settlement of that carrying amount\nwill make future tax payments larger (smaller) than they would be if such recovery or settlement were to\nhave no tax consequences, this Standard requires an entity to recognise a deferred tax liability (deferred tax\nasset), with certain limited exceptions.  \nThis Standard requires an entity to account for the tax consequences of transactions and other events in the\nsame way that it accounts for the transactions and other events themselves. Thus, for transactions and other\nevents recognised in profit or loss, any related tax effects are also recognised in profit or loss. For\ntransactions and other events recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or\ndirectly in equity), any related tax effects are also recognised outside profit or loss (either in other\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively). Similarly, the recognition of deferred tax assets\nand liabilities in a business combination affects the amount of goodwill arising in that business combination\nor the amount of the bargain purchase gain recognised.  \nThis Standard also deals with the recognition of deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or unused\ntax credits, the presentation of income taxes in the financial statements and the disclosure of information\nrelating to income taxes.",

The related interest revenue will be taxed on a cash  \nbasis. The tax base of the interest receivable is nil.  \n3 Trade receivables have a carrying amount of 100. The related revenue has already been included in  \ntaxable profit (tax loss). The tax base of the trade receivables is 100.  \n4 Dividends receivable from a subsidiary have a carrying amount of 100. The dividends are not taxable.  \n_In substance, the entire carrying amount of the asset_ _is deductible against the economic benefits._\n_Consequently, the tax base of the dividends receivable is 100.[(a)]_  \n5 A loan receivable has a carrying amount of 100. The repayment of the loan will have no tax  \nconsequences. The tax base of the loan is 100.  \n(a) Under this analysis, there is no taxable temporary difference. An alternative analysis is that the accrued dividends\nreceivable have a tax base of nil and that a tax rate of nil is applied to the resulting taxable temporary difference of\n100. Under both analyses, there is no deferred tax liability.  \n8 The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in\nrespect of that liability in future periods. In the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of\nthe resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in future\nperiods.  \n### Examples\n1 Current liabilities include accrued expenses with a carrying amount of 100. The related expense will  \nbe deducted for tax purposes on a cash basis. The tax base of the accrued expenses is nil.  \n2 Current liabilities include interest revenue received in advance, with a carrying amount of 100. The  \nrelated interest revenue was taxed on a cash basis. The tax base of the interest received in advance is\n_nil._  \n3 Current liabilities include accrued expenses with a carrying amount of 100. The related expense has  \nalready been deducted for tax purposes. The tax base of the accrued expenses is 100.  \n4 Current liabilities include accrued fines and penalties with a carrying amount of 100. Fines and  \npenalties are not deductible for tax purposes. The tax base of the accrued fines and penalties is 100.[(a)]  \n5 A loan payable has a carrying amount of 100. The repayment of the loan will have no tax  \nconsequences. The tax base of the loan is 100.  \n(a) Under this analysis, there is no deductible temporary difference. An alternative analysis is that the accrued fines\nand penalties payable have a tax base of nil and that a tax rate of nil is applied to the resulting deductible\ntemporary difference of 100. Under both analyses, there is no deferred tax asset.  \n9 Some items have a tax base but are not recognised as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial\nposition. For example, research costs are recognised as an expense in determining accounting profit in the\nperiod in which they are incurred but may not be permitted as a deduction in determining taxable profit (tax\nloss) until a later period. The difference between the tax base of the research costs, being the amount the\ntaxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a\ndeductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset.  \n10 Where the tax base of an asset or liability is not immediately apparent, it is helpful to consider the\nfundamental principle upon which this Standard is based: that an entity shall, with certain limited\nexceptions, recognise a deferred tax liability (asset) whenever recovery or settlement of the carrying amount\nof an asset or liability would make future tax payments larger (smaller) than they would be if such recovery\nor settlement were to have no tax consequences. Example C following paragraph 51A illustrates  \n-----  circumstances when it may be helpful to consider this fundamental principle, for example, when the tax\nbase of an asset or liability depends on the expected manner of recovery or settlement.  \n11 In consolidated financial statements, temporary differences are determined by comparing the carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with the appropriate tax base. The\ntax base is determined by reference to a consolidated tax return in those jurisdictions in which such a return\nis filed. In other jurisdictions, the tax base is determined by reference to the tax returns of each entity in the\ngroup.",

To recover the_\n_carrying amount of 100, the entity must earn taxable income of 100, but will only be able to deduct tax_\n_depreciation of 60. Consequently, the entity will pay income taxes of 10 (40 at 25%) when it recovers the_\n_carrying amount of the asset. The difference between the carrying amount of 100 and the tax base of 60_  \n-----    \n### Example\n_is a taxable temporary difference of 40. Therefore, the entity recognises a deferred tax liability of 10 (40_\n_at 25%) representing the income taxes that it will pay when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset._  \n17 Some temporary differences arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period\nbut is included in taxable profit in a different period. Such temporary differences are often described as\ntiming differences. The following are examples of temporary differences of this kind which are taxable\ntemporary differences and which therefore result in deferred tax liabilities:  \n(a) interest revenue is included in accounting profit on a time proportion basis but may, in some\njurisdictions, be included in taxable profit when cash is collected. The tax base of any receivable\nrecognised in the statement of financial position with respect to such revenues is nil because the\nrevenues do not affect taxable profit until cash is collected;  \n(b) depreciation used in determining taxable profit (tax loss) may differ from that used in determining\naccounting profit. The temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of the\nasset and its tax base which is the original cost of the asset less all deductions in respect of that\nasset permitted by the taxation authorities in determining taxable profit of the current and prior\nperiods. A taxable temporary difference arises, and results in a deferred tax liability, when tax\ndepreciation is accelerated (if tax depreciation is less rapid than accounting depreciation, a\ndeductible temporary difference arises, and results in a deferred tax asset); and  \n(c) development costs may be capitalised and amortised over future periods in determining\naccounting profit but deducted in determining taxable profit in the period in which they are\nincurred.

Moreover, in such jurisdictions, the cost of goodwill is often not\ndeductible when a subsidiary disposes of its underlying business. In such jurisdictions, goodwill has a tax\nbase of nil. Any difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and its tax base of nil is a taxable\ntemporary difference. However, this Standard does not permit the recognition of the resulting deferred tax\nliability because goodwill is measured as a residual and the recognition of the deferred tax liability would\nincrease the carrying amount of goodwill.  \n21A Subsequent reductions in a deferred tax liability that is unrecognised because it arises from the initial\nrecognition of goodwill are also regarded as arising from the initial recognition of goodwill and are\ntherefore not recognised under paragraph 15(a). For example, if in a business combination an entity\nrecognises goodwill of CU100 that has a tax base of nil, paragraph 15(a) prohibits the entity from\nrecognising the resulting deferred tax liability. If the entity subsequently recognises an impairment loss of\nCU20 for that goodwill, the amount of the taxable temporary difference relating to the goodwill is reduced\nfrom CU100 to CU80, with a resulting decrease in the value of the unrecognised deferred tax liability. That\ndecrease in the value of the unrecognised deferred tax liability is also regarded as relating to the initial\nrecognition of the goodwill and is therefore prohibited from being recognised under paragraph 15(a).  \n21B Deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences relating to goodwill are, however, recognised to\nthe extent they do not arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. For example, if in a business\ncombination an entity recognises goodwill of CU100 that is deductible for tax purposes at a rate of 20 per\ncent per year starting in the year of acquisition, the tax base of the goodwill is CU100 on initial recognition\nand CU80 at the end of the year of acquisition. If the carrying amount of goodwill at the end of the year of\nacquisition remains unchanged at CU100, a taxable temporary difference of CU20 arises at the end of that\nyear.

The\neffective interest rate is 2%. The debt instrument is measured at fair value.  \nAt the end of Year 2, the fair value of the debt instrument has decreased to CU918 as a result of an\nincrease in market interest rates to 5%. It is probable that Entity A will collect all the contractual cash\nflows if it continues to hold the debt instrument.  \nAny gains (losses) on the debt instrument are taxable (deductible) only when realised. The gains (losses)\narising on the sale or maturity of the debt instrument are calculated for tax purposes as the difference\nbetween the amount collected and the original cost of the debt instrument.  \n-----    \n### Example illustrating paragraph 26(d)\nAccordingly, the tax base of the debt instrument is its original cost.  \n_The difference between the carrying amount of the debt instrument in Entity A\u2019s statement of financial_\n_position of CU918 and its tax base of CU1,000 gives rise to a deductible temporary difference of CU82_\n_at the end of Year 2 (see paragraphs 20 and 26(d)), irrespective of whether Entity A expects to recover_\n_the carrying amount of the debt instrument by sale or by use, ie by holding it and collecting contractual_\n_cash flows, or a combination of both._  \n_This is because deductible temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an_\n_asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base that will result in amounts that are_\n_deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods, when the carrying amount of the_\n_asset or liability is recovered or settled (see paragraph 5). Entity A obtains a deduction equivalent to the_\n_tax base of the asset of CU1,000 in determining taxable profit (tax loss) either on sale or on maturity._  \n27 The reversal of deductible temporary differences results in deductions in determining taxable profits of\nfuture periods. However, economic benefits in the form of reductions in tax payments will flow to the entity\nonly if it earns sufficient taxable profits against which the deductions can be offset. Therefore, an entity\nrecognises deferred tax assets only when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which\nthe deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  \n27A When an entity assesses whether taxable profits will be available against which it can utilise a deductible\ntemporary difference, it considers whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it\nmay make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference. If tax law imposes no such\nrestrictions, an entity assesses a deductible temporary difference in combination with all of its other\ndeductible temporary differences. However, if tax law restricts the utilisation of losses to deduction against\nincome of a specific type, a deductible temporary difference is assessed in combination only with other\ndeductible temporary differences of the appropriate type.  \n28 It is probable that taxable profit will be available against which a deductible temporary difference can be\nutilised when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and\nthe same taxable entity which are expected to reverse:  \n(a) in the same period as the expected reversal of the deductible temporary difference; or  \n(b) in periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward.  \nIn such circumstances, the deferred tax asset is recognised in the period in which the deductible temporary\ndifferences arise.  \n29 When there are insufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the\nsame taxable entity, the deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that:  \n(a) it is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit relating to the same taxation\nauthority and the same taxable entity in the same period as the reversal of the deductible\ntemporary difference (or in the periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset\ncan be carried back or forward). In evaluating whether it will have sufficient taxable profit in\nfuture periods, an entity:  \n(i) compares the deductible temporary differences with future taxable profit that excludes\ntax deductions resulting from the reversal of those deductible temporary differences.\nThis comparison shows the extent to which the future taxable profit is sufficient for the\nentity to deduct the amounts resulting from the reversal of those deductible temporary\ndifferences; and  \n(ii) ignores taxable amounts arising from deductible temporary differences that are\nexpected to originate in future periods, because the deferred tax asset arising from these\ndeductible temporary differences will itself require future taxable profit in order to be\nutilised; or  \n(b) tax planning opportunities are available to the entity that will create taxable profit in appropriate\nperiods.  \n29A The estimate of probable future taxable profit may include the recovery of some of an entity\u2019s assets for\nmore than their carrying amount if there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the entity will achieve\nthis. For example, when an asset is measured at fair value, the entity shall consider whether there is\nsufficient evidence to conclude that it is probable that the entity will recover the asset for more than its  \n-----  carrying amount. This may be the case, for example, when an entity expects to hold a fixed-rate debt\ninstrument and collect the contractual cash flows.  \n30 Tax planning opportunities are actions that the entity would take in order to create or increase taxable\nincome in a particular period before the expiry of a tax loss or tax credit carryforward. For example, in\nsome jurisdictions, taxable profit may be created or increased by:  \n(a) electing to have interest income taxed on either a received or receivable basis;  \n(b) deferring the claim for certain deductions from taxable profit;  \n(c) selling, and perhaps leasing back, assets that have appreciated but for which the tax base has not\nbeen adjusted to reflect such appreciation; and  \n(d) selling an asset that generates non-taxable income (such as, in some jurisdictions, a government\nbond) in order to purchase another investment that generates taxable income.  \nWhere tax planning opportunities advance taxable profit from a later period to an earlier period, the\nutilisation of a tax loss or tax credit carryforward still depends on the existence of future taxable profit from\nsources other than future originating temporary differences.  \n31 When an entity has a history of recent losses, the entity considers the guidance in paragraphs 35 and 36.  \n32 [Deleted]",

Such differences may arise in a number\nof different circumstances, for example:  \n(a) the existence of undistributed profits of subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements;  \n(b) changes in foreign exchange rates when a parent and its subsidiary are based in different\ncountries; and  \n(c) a reduction in the carrying amount of an investment in an associate to its recoverable amount.  \nIn consolidated financial statements, the temporary difference may be different from the temporary\ndifference associated with that investment in the parent\u2019s separate financial statements if the parent carries\nthe investment in its separate financial statements at cost or revalued amount.  \n**39** **An entity shall recognise a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with**\n**investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to**\n**the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:**  \n**(a)** **the parent, investor, joint venturer or joint operator is able to control the timing of the**\n**reversal of the temporary difference; and**  \n**(b)** **it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.**  \n40 As a parent controls the dividend policy of its subsidiary, it is able to control the timing of the reversal of\ntemporary differences associated with that investment (including the temporary differences arising not only\nfrom undistributed profits but also from any foreign exchange translation differences). Furthermore, it\nwould often be impracticable to determine the amount of income taxes that would be payable when the\ntemporary difference reverses. Therefore, when the parent has determined that those profits will not be\ndistributed in the foreseeable future the parent does not recognise a deferred tax liability. The same\nconsiderations apply to investments in branches.  \n41 The non-monetary assets and liabilities of an entity are measured in its functional currency (see AASB 121\n_The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates). If the entity\u2019s taxable profit or tax loss (and, hence, the_\ntax base of its non-monetary assets and liabilities) is determined in a different currency, changes in the\nexchange rate give rise to temporary differences that result in a recognised deferred tax liability or (subject\nto paragraph 24) asset. The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss (see paragraph 58).  \n42 An investor in an associate does not control that entity and is usually not in a position to determine its\ndividend policy. Therefore, in the absence of an agreement requiring that the profits of the associate will not  \n-----  be distributed in the foreseeable future, an investor recognises a deferred tax liability arising from taxable\ntemporary differences associated with its investment in the associate. In some cases, an investor may not be\nable to determine the amount of tax that would be payable if it recovers the cost of its investment in an\nassociate, but can determine that it will equal or exceed a minimum amount. In such cases, the deferred tax\nliability is measured at this amount.  \n43 The arrangement between the parties to a joint arrangement usually deals with the distribution of the profits\nand identifies whether decisions on such matters require the consent of all the parties or a group of the\nparties. When the joint venturer or joint operator can control the timing of the distribution of its share of the\nprofits of the joint arrangement and it is probable that its share of the profits will not be distributed in the\nforeseeable future, a deferred tax liability is not recognised.  \n**44** **An entity shall recognise a deferred tax asset for all deductible temporary differences arising from**\n**investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent**\n**that, and only to the extent that, it is probable that:**  \n**(a)** **the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and**  \n**(b)** **taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.**  \n45 In deciding whether a deferred tax asset is recognised for deductible temporary differences associated with\nits investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and its interests in joint arrangements, an entity\nconsiders the guidance set out in paragraphs 28 to 31.",

It comprises land with a cost of 40 and fair value of 60 and a building with a cost of 60\nand fair value of 90. The land has an unlimited useful life.  \nCumulative depreciation of the building for tax purposes is 30. Unrealised changes in the fair value of\nthe investment property do not affect taxable profit. If the investment property is sold for more than cost,\nthe reversal of the cumulative tax depreciation of 30 will be included in taxable profit and taxed at an\nordinary tax rate of 30%. For sales proceeds in excess of cost, tax law specifies tax rates of 25% for\nassets held for less than two years and 20% for assets held for two years or more.  \n_Because the investment property is measured using the fair value model in AASB 140, there is a_\n_rebuttable presumption that the entity will recover the carrying amount of the investment property_\n_entirely through sale. If that presumption is not rebutted, the deferred tax reflects the tax consequences_\n_of recovering the carrying amount entirely through sale, even if the entity expects to earn rental income_\n_from the property before sale._  \n_The tax base of the land if it is sold is 40 and there is a taxable temporary difference of 20 (60 \u2013 40). The_\n_tax base of the building if it is sold is 30 (60 \u2013 30) and there is a taxable temporary difference of 60 (90 \u2013_\n_30). As a result, the total taxable temporary difference relating to the investment property is 80 (20 +_\n_60)._  \n_In accordance with paragraph 47, the tax rate is the rate expected to apply to the period when the_\n_investment property is realised. Thus, the resulting deferred tax liability is computed as follows, if the_\n_entity expects to sell the property after holding it for more than two years:_  \n_Taxable_  \n_Temporary_  \n_Difference_  \n_Tax Rate_ _Deferred Tax_  \n_Liability_  \nCumulative tax depreciation _30_ _30%_ _9_  \nProceeds in excess of cost _50_ _20%_ _10_  \nTotal _80_ _19_  \n_If the entity expects to sell the property after holding it for less than two years, the above computation_\n_would be amended to apply a tax rate of 25%, rather than 20%, to the proceeds in excess of cost._  \n_If, instead, the entity holds the building within a business model whose objective is to consume_\n_substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the building over time, rather than through sale,_\n_this presumption would be rebutted for the building. However, the land is not depreciable. Therefore the_\n_presumption of recovery through sale would not be rebutted for the land. It follows that the deferred tax_\n_liability would reflect the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the building through_\n_use and the carrying amount of the land through sale._  \n_The tax base of the building if it is used is 30 (60 \u2013 30) and there is a taxable temporary difference of 60_\n_(90 \u2013 30), resulting in a deferred tax liability of 18 (60 at 30%)._  \n_The tax base of the land if it is sold is 40 and there is a taxable temporary difference of 20 (60 \u2013 40),_\n_resulting in a deferred tax liability of 4 (20 at 20%)._  \n_As a result, if the presumption of recovery through sale is rebutted for the building, the deferred tax_\n_liability relating to the investment property is 22 (18 + 4)._  \n51D The rebuttable presumption in paragraph 51C also applies when a deferred tax liability or a deferred tax\nasset arises from measuring investment property in a business combination if the entity will use the fair\nvalue model when subsequently measuring that investment property.  \n51E Paragraphs 51B\u201351D do not change the requirements to apply the principles in paragraphs 24\u201333\n(deductible temporary differences) and paragraphs 34\u201336 (unused tax losses and unused tax credits) of this\nStandard when recognising and measuring deferred tax assets.  \n52 [moved and renumbered 51A]  \n-----  52A In some jurisdictions, income taxes are payable at a higher or lower rate if part or all of the net profit or\nretained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders of the entity.

The tax rate on distributed profits is 35%.\nAt the end of the reporting period, 31 December 20X1, the entity does not recognise a liability for\ndividends proposed or declared after the reporting period. As a result, no dividends are recognised in the\nyear 20X1. Taxable income for 20X1 is 100,000. The net taxable temporary difference for the year 20X1\nis 40,000.  \n_The entity recognises a current tax liability and a current income tax expense of 50,000. No asset_ _is_\n_recognised for the amount potentially recoverable as a result of future dividends. The entity also_\n_recognises a deferred tax liability and deferred tax expense of 20,000 (40,000 at 50%) representing the_\n_income taxes that the entity will pay when it recovers or settles the carrying amounts_ _of its assets and_\n_liabilities based on the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits._  \nSubsequently, on 15 March 20X2 the entity recognises dividends of 10,000 from previous operating\nprofits as a liability.  \n_On 15 March 20X2, the entity recognises the recovery of income taxes of 1,500 (15% of the dividends_\n_recognised as a liability) as a current tax asset and as a reduction of current income tax expense for_\n_20X2._  \n**53** **Deferred tax assets and liabilities shall not be discounted.**  \n54 The reliable determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities on a discounted basis requires detailed\nscheduling of the timing of the reversal of each temporary difference. In many cases such scheduling is\nimpracticable or highly complex. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require discounting of deferred tax assets\nand liabilities. To permit, but not to require, discounting would result in deferred tax assets and liabilities\nwhich would not be comparable between entities. Therefore, this Standard does not require or permit the\ndiscounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  \n55 Temporary differences are determined by reference to the carrying amount of an asset or liability.

Examples of such items are:  \n(a) an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings resulting from either a change in\naccounting policy that is applied retrospectively or the correction of an error (see AASB 108\n_Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors); and_  \n(b) amounts arising on initial recognition of the equity component of a compound financial\ninstrument (see paragraph 23).  \n-----  63 In exceptional circumstances it may be difficult to determine the amount of current and deferred tax that\nrelates to items recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in\nequity). This may be the case, for example, when:  \n(a) there are graduated rates of income tax and it is impossible to determine the rate at which a\nspecific component of taxable profit (tax loss) has been taxed;  \n(b) a change in the tax rate or other tax rules affects a deferred tax asset or liability relating (in whole\nor in part) to an item that was previously recognised outside profit or loss; or  \n(c) an entity determines that a deferred tax asset should be recognised, or should no longer be\nrecognised in full, and the deferred tax asset relates (in whole or in part) to an item that was\npreviously recognised outside profit or loss.  \nIn such cases, the current and deferred tax related to items that are recognised outside profit or loss are\nbased on a reasonable pro rata allocation of the current and deferred tax of the entity in the tax jurisdiction\nconcerned, or other method that achieves a more appropriate allocation in the circumstances.  \n64 AASB 116 does not specify whether an entity should transfer each year from revaluation surplus to retained\nearnings an amount equal to the difference between the depreciation or amortisation on a revalued asset and\nthe depreciation or amortisation based on the cost of that asset. If an entity makes such a transfer, the\namount transferred is net of any related deferred tax. Similar considerations apply to transfers made on\ndisposal of an item of property, plant or equipment.  \n65 When an asset is revalued for tax purposes and that revaluation is related to an accounting revaluation of an\nearlier period, or to one that is expected to be carried out in a future period, the tax effects of both the asset\nrevaluation and the adjustment of the tax base are recognised in other comprehensive income in the periods\nin which they occur. However, if the revaluation for tax purposes is not related to an accounting revaluation\nof an earlier period, or to one that is expected to be carried out in a future period, the tax effects of the\nadjustment of the tax base are recognised in profit or loss.  \n65A When an entity pays dividends to its shareholders, it may be required to pay a portion of the dividends to\ntaxation authorities on behalf of shareholders. In many jurisdictions, this amount is referred to as a\nwithholding tax. Such an amount paid or payable to taxation authorities is charged to equity as a part of the\ndividends.",

In\naccordance with AASB 3, an entity recognises any resulting deferred tax assets (to the extent that they meet\nthe recognition criteria in paragraph 24) or deferred tax liabilities as identifiable assets and liabilities at the\nacquisition date. Consequently, those deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities affect the amount of\ngoodwill or the bargain purchase gain the entity recognises. However, in accordance with paragraph 15(a),\nan entity does not recognise deferred tax liabilities arising from the initial recognition of goodwill.  \n67 As a result of a business combination, the probability of realising a pre-acquisition deferred tax asset of the\nacquirer could change. An acquirer may consider it probable that it will recover its own deferred tax asset\nthat was not recognised before the business combination. For example, the acquirer may be able to utilise\nthe benefit of its unused tax losses against the future taxable profit of the acquiree. Alternatively, as a result\nof the business combination it might no longer be probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred\ntax asset to be recovered. In such cases, the acquirer recognises a change in the deferred tax asset in the\nperiod of the business combination, but does not include it as part of the accounting for the business\ncombination. Therefore, the acquirer does not take it into account in measuring the goodwill or bargain\npurchase gain it recognises in the business combination.  \n68 The potential benefit of the acquiree\u2019s income tax loss carryforwards or other deferred tax assets might not\nsatisfy the criteria for separate recognition when a business combination is initially accounted for but might\nbe realised subsequently. An entity shall recognise acquired deferred tax benefits that it realises after the\nbusiness combination as follows:  \n(a) Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised within the measurement period that result from new\ninformation about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date shall be applied to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill related to that acquisition. If the carrying amount of\nthat goodwill is zero, any remaining deferred tax benefits shall be recognised in profit or loss.  \n(b) All other acquired deferred tax benefits realised shall be recognised in profit or loss (or, if this\nStandard so requires, outside profit or loss).  \n-----  ",

The amount of that tax deduction may differ from the related cumulative remuneration expense, and\nmay arise in a later accounting period. For example, in some jurisdictions, an entity may recognise an\nexpense for the consumption of employee services received as consideration for share options granted, in\naccordance with AASB 2 Share-based Payment, and not receive a tax deduction until the share options are\nexercised, with the measurement of the tax deduction based on the entity\u2019s share price at the date of\nexercise.  \n68B As with the research costs discussed in paragraphs 9 and 26(b) of this Standard, the difference between the\ntax base of the employee services received to date (being the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a\ndeduction in future periods), and the carrying amount of nil, is a deductible temporary difference that results\nin a deferred tax asset. If the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is\nnot known at the end of the period, it shall be estimated, based on information available at the end of the\nperiod. For example, if the amount that the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods\nis dependent upon the entity\u2019s share price at a future date, the measurement of the deductible temporary\ndifference should be based on the entity\u2019s share price at the end of the period.  \n68C As noted in paragraph 68A, the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction, measured in\naccordance with paragraph 68B) may differ from the related cumulative remuneration expense. Paragraph\n58 of the Standard requires that current and deferred tax should be recognised as income or an expense and\nincluded in profit or loss for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or\nevent that is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside profit or loss, or (b) a business\ncombination (other than the acquisition by an investment entity of a subsidiary that is required to be\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss). If the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax\ndeduction) exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, this indicates that the tax\ndeduction relates not only to remuneration expense but also to an equity item. In this situation, the excess of\nthe associated current or deferred tax should be recognised directly in equity.",

Nevertheless, where practicable,\nentities are encouraged to disclose the amounts of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities because financial\nstatement users may find such information useful.  \n87A Paragraph 82A requires an entity to disclose the nature of the potential income tax consequences that would\nresult from the payment of dividends to its shareholders. An entity discloses the important features of the\nincome tax systems and the factors that will affect the amount of the potential income tax consequences of\ndividends.  \n-----  87B It would sometimes not be practicable to compute the total amount of the potential income tax\nconsequences that would result from the payment of dividends to shareholders. This may be the case, for\nexample, where an entity has a large number of foreign subsidiaries. However, even in such circumstances,\nsome portions of the total amount may be easily determinable. For example, in a consolidated group, a\nparent and some of its subsidiaries may have paid income taxes at a higher rate on undistributed profits and\nbe aware of the amount that would be refunded on the payment of future dividends to shareholders from\nconsolidated retained earnings. In this case, that refundable amount is disclosed. If applicable, the entity\nalso discloses that there are additional potential income tax consequences not practicably determinable. In\nthe parent\u2019s separate financial statements, if any, the disclosure of the potential income tax consequences\nrelates to the parent\u2019s retained earnings.  \n87C An entity required to provide the disclosures in paragraph 82A may also be required to provide disclosures\nrelated to temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates or\ninterests in joint arrangements. In such cases, an entity considers this in determining the information to be\ndisclosed under paragraph 82A. For example, an entity may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of\ntemporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which no deferred tax liabilities have\nbeen recognised (see paragraph 81(f)). If it is impracticable to compute the amounts of unrecognised\ndeferred tax liabilities (see paragraph 87) there may be amounts of potential income tax consequences of\ndividends not practicably determinable related to these subsidiaries.  \n88 An entity discloses any tax-related contingent liabilities and contingent assets in accordance with\nAASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Contingent liabilities and contingent\nassets may arise, for example, from unresolved disputes with the taxation authorities. Similarly, where\nchanges in tax rates or tax laws are enacted or announced after the reporting period, an entity discloses any\nsignificant effect of those changes on its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities (see AASB 110\n_Events after the Reporting Period)._",

In X5 the enacted income tax rate was 40% of\ntaxable profit. In X6 the enacted income tax rate was 35% of taxable profit.  \nCharitable donations are recognised as an expense when they are paid and are not deductible for tax purposes.  \nIn X5, the entity was notified by the relevant authorities that they intend to pursue an action against the entity with\nrespect to sulphur emissions. Although as at December X6 the action had not yet come to court the entity recognised a\nliability of 700 in X5 being its best estimate of the fine arising from the action. Fines are not deductible for tax\npurposes.  \nIn X2, the entity incurred 1,250 of costs in relation to the development of a new product. These costs were deducted\nfor tax purposes in X2. For accounting purposes, the entity capitalised this expenditure and amortised it on the\nstraight-line basis over five years. At 31/12/X4, the unamortised balance of these product development costs was 500.  \nIn X5, the entity entered into an agreement with its existing employees to provide healthcare benefits to retirees. The\nentity recognises as an expense the cost of this plan as employees provide service. No payments to retirees were made\nfor such benefits in X5 or X6. Healthcare costs are deductible for tax purposes when payments are made to retirees.\nThe entity has determined that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which any resulting deferred\ntax asset can be utilised.  \nBuildings are depreciated for accounting purposes at 5% a year on a straight-line basis and at 10% a year on a\nstraight-line basis for tax purposes. Motor vehicles are depreciated for accounting purposes at 20% a year on a\nstraight-line basis and at 25% a year on a straight-line basis for tax purposes. A full year\u2019s depreciation is charged for\naccounting purposes in the year that an asset is acquired.  \nAt 1/1/X6, the building was revalued to 65,000 and the entity estimated that the remaining useful life of the building\nwas 20 years from the date of the revaluation. The revaluation did not affect taxable profit in X6 and the taxation\nauthorities did not adjust the tax base of the building to reflect the revaluation. In X6, the entity transferred 1,033 from\nrevaluation surplus to retained earnings. This represents the difference of 1,590 between the actual depreciation on the\nbuilding (3,250) and equivalent depreciation based on the cost of the building (1,660, which is the book value at\n1/1/X6 of 33,200 divided by the remaining useful life of 20 years), less the related deferred tax of 557 (see paragraph\n64 of the Standard).",

Therefore, the tax base of the goodwill in\nB\u2019s jurisdiction is nil. However, in accordance with paragraph 15(a) of the Standard, A recognises no deferred tax\nliability for the taxable temporary difference associated with the goodwill in B\u2019s tax jurisdiction.  \nThe carrying amount, in A\u2019s consolidated financial statements, of its investment in B is made up as follows:  \nFair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, excluding deferred tax 504  \nDeferred tax liability (135 at 40%) (54)  \nFair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 450  \nGoodwill 150  \nCarrying amount 600  \nBecause, at the acquisition date, the tax base in A\u2019s tax jurisdiction, of A\u2019s investment in B is 600, no temporary\ndifference is associated in A\u2019s tax jurisdiction with the investment.  \nDuring X5, B\u2019s equity (incorporating the fair value adjustments made as a result of the business combination) changed\nas follows:  \nAt 1 January X5 450  \nRetained profit for X5 (net profit of 150, less dividend payable of 80) 70  \nAt 31 December X5 520  \n-----  A recognises a liability for any withholding tax or other taxes that it will incur on the accrued dividend receivable of\n80.  \nAt 31 December X5, the carrying amount of A\u2019s underlying investment in B, excluding the accrued dividend\nreceivable, is as follows:  \nNet assets of B 520  \nGoodwill 150  \nCarrying amount 670  \nThe temporary difference associated with A\u2019s underlying investment is 70. This amount is equal to the cumulative\nretained profit since the acquisition date.  \nIf A has determined that it will not sell the investment in the foreseeable future and that B will not distribute its\nretained profits in the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognised in relation to A\u2019s investment in B (see\nparagraphs 39 and 40 of the Standard). Note that this exception would apply for an investment in an associate only if\nthere is an agreement requiring that the profits of the associate will not be distributed in the foreseeable future (see\nparagraph 42 of the Standard). A discloses the amount of the temporary difference for which no deferred tax is\nrecognised, ie 70 (see paragraph 81(f) of the Standard).  \nIf A expects to sell the investment in B, or that B will distribute its retained profits in the foreseeable future, A\nrecognises a deferred tax liability to the extent that the temporary difference is expected to reverse. The tax rate\nreflects the manner in which A expects to recover the carrying amount of its investment (see paragraph 51 of the\nStandard). A recognises the deferred tax in other comprehensive income to the extent that the deferred tax results from\nforeign exchange translation differences that have been recognised in other comprehensive income (paragraph 61A of\nthe Standard).

A tax deduction will not arise until the options\nare exercised, and the deduction is based on the options\u2019 intrinsic value at exercise date.  \nAs explained in paragraph 68B of the Standard, the difference between the tax base of the employee services received\nto date (being the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods in respect of those\nservices), and the carrying amount of nil, is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset.\nParagraph 68B requires that, if the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is not\nknown at the end of the period, it should be estimated, based on information available at the end of the period. If the\namount that the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is dependent upon the entity\u2019s share\nprice at a future date, the measurement of the deductible temporary difference should be based on the entity\u2019s share\nprice at the end of the period. Therefore, in this example, the estimated future tax deduction (and hence the\nmeasurement of the deferred tax asset) should be based on the options\u2019 intrinsic value at the end of the period.  \nAs explained in paragraph 68C of the Standard, if the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction) exceeds the\namount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, this indicates that the tax deduction relates not only to\nremuneration expense but also to an equity item. In this situation, paragraph 68C requires that the excess of the\nassociated current or deferred tax should be recognised directly in equity.  \nThe entity\u2019s tax rate is 40 per cent. The options were granted at the start of year 1, vested at the end of year 3 and were\nexercised at the end of year 5.

They include:  \n(a) future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences;  \n(b) taxable profit in future periods; and  \n(c) tax planning opportunities.  \nThe deductible temporary difference that arises from Debt Instrument C is assessed separately for utilisation. This is\nbecause tax law classifies the loss resulting from recovering the carrying amount of Debt Instrument C by sale as\ncapital and allows capital losses to be offset only against capital gains (see paragraph 27A of the Standard).  \nThe separate assessment results in not recognising a deferred tax asset for the deductible temporary difference that\narises from Debt Instrument C because Entity Z has no source of taxable profit available that tax law classifies as\ncapital.  \nIn contrast, the deductible temporary difference that arises from Debt Instrument A and other sources are assessed for\nutilisation in combination with one another. This is because their related tax deductions would be classified as\nordinary by tax law.  \nThe tax deductions represented by the deductible temporary differences related to Debt Instrument A are classified as\nordinary because the tax law classifies the effect on taxable profit (tax loss) from deducting the tax base on maturity as\nordinary.  \nIn assessing the utilisation of deductible temporary differences on 31 December 20X1, the following two steps are\nperformed by Entity Z.  \n**Step 1: Utilisation of deductible temporary differences because of the reversal of**\n**taxable temporary differences (see paragraph 28 of the Standard)**  \nEntity Z first assesses the availability of taxable temporary differences as follows:  \n(CU)  \nExpected reversal of deductible temporary differences in 20X2  \nFrom Debt Instrument A 57,143  \nFrom other sources 430,000  \n-----  Total reversal of deductible temporary differences 487,143  \nExpected reversal of taxable temporary differences in 20X2  \nFrom Debt Instrument B (28,571)  \nFrom other sources (50,000)  \nTotal reversal of taxable temporary differences (78,571)  \nUtilisation because of the reversal of taxable temporary differences (Step 1) 78,571  \nRemaining deductible temporary differences to be assessed for utilisation in Step 2\n(487,143 \u2013 78,571) 408,572  \nIn Step 1, Entity Z can recognise a deferred tax asset in relation to a deductible temporary difference of CU78,571.  \n**Step 2: Utilisation of deductible temporary differences because of future taxable profit**\n**(see paragraph 29(a) of the Standard)**  \nIn this step, Entity Z assesses the availability of future taxable profit as follows:  \n(CU)  \nProbable future tax profit (loss) in 20X2 (upon which income taxes are payable\n(recoverable)) (200,000)  \nAdd back: reversal of deductible temporary differences expected to reverse in 20X2 487,143  \nLess: reversal of taxable temporary differences (utilised in Step 1) (78,571)  \n**Probable taxable profit excluding tax deductions for assessing utilisation of**\n**deductible temporary differences in 20X2** 208,572  \nRemaining deductible temporary differences to be assessed for utilisation from Step 1 408,572  \n**Utilisation because of future taxable profit (Step 2)** 208,572  \nUtilisation because of the reversal of taxable temporary differences (Step 1) 78,571  \n**Total utilisation of deductible temporary differences** 287,143  \nThe tax loss of CU200,000 includes the taxable economic benefit of CU2 million from the collection of the principal\nof Debt Instrument A and the equivalent tax deduction, because it is probable that Entity Z will recover the debt\ninstrument for more than its carrying amount (see paragraph 29A of the Standard).  \nThe utilisation of deductible temporary differences is not, however, assessed against probable future taxable profit for\na period upon which income taxes are payable (see paragraph 5 of the Standard). Instead, the utilisation of deductible\ntemporary differences is assessed against probable future taxable profit that excludes tax deductions resulting from the\nreversal of deductible temporary differences (see paragraph 29(a) of the Standard). Assessing the utilisation of\ndeductible temporary differences against probable future taxable profits without excluding those deductions would\nlead to double counting the deductible temporary differences in that assessment.  \nIn Step 2, Entity Z determines that it can recognise a deferred tax asset in relation to a future taxable profit, excluding\ntax deductions resulting from the reversal of deductible temporary differences, of CU208,572. Consequently, the total\nutilisation of deductible temporary differences amounts to CU287,143 (CU78,571 (Step 1) + CU208,572 (Step 2)).",
