        "page_content=": "## Operating segments  \n5 An operating segment is a component of an entity:  \n(a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including\nrevenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity),  \n(b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity\u2019s chief operating decision maker to\nmake decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and  \n(c) for which discrete financial information is available.  \nAn operating segment may engage in business activities for which it has yet to earn revenues, for example,\nstart-up operations may be operating segments before earning revenues.  \n6 Not every part of an entity is necessarily an operating segment or part of an operating segment. For\nexample, a corporate headquarters or some functional departments may not earn revenues or may earn\nrevenues that are only incidental to the activities of the entity and would not be operating segments. For the\npurposes of this Standard, an entity\u2019s post-employment benefit plans are not operating segments.  \n7 The term \u2018chief operating decision maker\u2019 identifies a function, not necessarily a manager with a specific\ntitle. That function is to allocate resources to and assess the performance of the operating segments of an\nentity. Often the chief operating decision maker of an entity is its chief executive officer or chief operating\nofficer but, for example, it may be a group of executive directors or others.  \n8 For many entities, the three characteristics of operating segments described in paragraph 5 clearly identify\nits operating segments. However, an entity may produce reports in which its business activities are\npresented in a variety of ways. If the chief operating decision maker uses more than one set of segment\ninformation, other factors may identify a single set of components as constituting an entity\u2019s operating\nsegments, including the nature of the business activities of each component, the existence of managers\nresponsible for them, and information presented to the board of directors.  \n9 Generally, an operating segment has a segment manager who is directly accountable to and maintains\nregular contact with the chief operating decision maker to discuss operating activities, financial results,\nforecasts, or plans for the segment. The term \u2018segment manager\u2019 identifies a function, not necessarily a\nmanager with a specific title. The chief operating decision maker also may be the segment manager for\nsome operating segments. A single manager may be the segment manager for more than one operating\nsegment. If the characteristics in paragraph 5 apply to more than one set of components of an organisation\nbut there is only one set for which segment managers are held responsible, that set of components\nconstitutes the operating segments.  \n10 The characteristics in paragraph 5 may apply to two or more overlapping sets of components for which\nmanagers are held responsible. That structure is sometimes referred to as a matrix form of organisation. For\nexample, in some entities, some managers are responsible for different product and service lines worldwide,\nwhereas other managers are responsible for specific geographical areas. The chief operating decision maker\nregularly reviews the operating results of both sets of components, and financial information is available for\nboth. In that situation, the entity shall determine which set of components constitutes the operating\nsegments by reference to the core principle.",

The sources of the revenue included in the \u2018all other segments\u2019\ncategory shall be described.  \n17 If management judges that an operating segment identified as a reportable segment in the immediately\npreceding period is of continuing significance, information about that segment shall continue to be reported\nseparately in the current period even if it no longer meets the criteria for reportability in paragraph 13.  \n18 If an operating segment is identified as a reportable segment in the current period in accordance with the\nquantitative thresholds, segment data for a prior period presented for comparative purposes shall be restated\nto reflect the newly reportable segment as a separate segment, even if that segment did not satisfy the\ncriteria for reportability in paragraph 13 in the prior period, unless the necessary information is not available\nand the cost to develop it would be excessive.  \n19 There may be a practical limit to the number of reportable segments that an entity separately discloses\nbeyond which segment information may become too detailed. Although no precise limit has been\ndetermined, as the number of segments that are reportable in accordance with paragraphs 13\u201318 increases\nabove ten, the entity should consider whether a practical limit has been reached.",
