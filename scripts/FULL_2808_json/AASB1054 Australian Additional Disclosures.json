        "page_content=": "## Background  \nReasons for issuing this Standard  \nBC2 Australia is the only jurisdiction with a \u2018reporting entity\u2019 concept that effectively permits entities to self\nassess what type of financial reporting they do when they are required by legislation or otherwise (such as\nby a constitutional document) to prepare financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting\nStandards (issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board). Therefore, unlike other jurisdictions, in\nAustralia two similar entities might prepare very different sets of financial statements, one preparing\ngeneral purpose financial statements using a robust and consistent framework, and the other preparing\nspecial purpose financial statements with self-selected requirements. The Board notes that the self-selection\nis subject to some constraints, imposed by paragraphs 7 and 10 to 12 of AASB 108 _Accounting Policies,_\n_Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._  \nBC3 Appendix A of AASB 1053 _Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards defines what a_  \nreporting entity is,[1] and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 _Definition of the Reporting Entity also_\nsets out the reporting entity concept. Paragraph 41 of SAC 1 states that \u201cReporting entities shall prepare\ngeneral purpose financial reports.\u201d[ 2] In relation to a group, SAC 1 states in paragraph 17 that \u201cthe group,\nwhich may be termed an economic entity, will be a reporting entity where there exist users dependent on\ngeneral purpose financial reports for making and evaluating resource allocation decisions regarding the\ncollective operations of the group of entities\u201d.  \nBC4 An entity that assesses itself to be a non-reporting entity can therefore prepare special purpose financial  \nstatements, which are not necessarily consistent, comparable, transparent or enforceable. In particular,\nspecial purpose financial statements do not always comply with the recognition and measurement\nrequirements[3] in Australian Accounting Standards and nor do they always disclose that fact. The Board is\naware of the view of some, that this situation is acceptable because, by inference, users of special purpose\nfinancial statements can demand any information they need. However, the Board has received feedback\nthat in practice that is often not the case. The Board determined that users should be provided with\nadequate information to enable them to confidently assess an entity\u2019s level of compliance with the\nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards in special purpose financial\nstatements or be alerted to areas where this has not been assessed, and is therefore unclear. Such\ndisclosures are expected to better support users in identifying where additional information is required.  \n1 \u201cReporting entity means an entity in respect of which it is reasonable to expect the existence of users who rely on the entity\u2019s general  \npurpose financial statements for information that will be useful to them for making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of\nresources. A reporting entity can be a single entity or a group comprising a parent and all of its subsidiaries.\u201d AASB 1053, Appendix A.  \n2 A \u201c \u2018general purpose financial report\u2019 means a financial report intended to meet the information needs common to users who are unable  \nto command the preparation of reports tailored so as to satisfy, specifically, all of their information needs\u201d. SAC 1, paragraph 6.  \n3 For those entities that are required to prepare and lodge financial statements with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  \n(ASIC) by Part 2M.3 of the Corporations Act 2001, and who are preparing special purpose financial statements, paragraph 2 of ASIC\nRegulatory Guide 85 Reporting requirements for non-reporting entities states \u201c\u2026 ASIC believes that non-reporting entities, which are\nrequired to prepare financial reports in accordance with Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act 2001 (Act), should comply with the\nrecognition and measurement requirements of accounting standards\u201d. For those entities that are required to prepare and lodge financial\nstatements with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), section 60.10(3) of ACNC Regulations requires\nfinancial statements and notes give a \u2018true and fair view\u2019, and the determination is required by the charity as well as the auditors in their\naudit report.  \n-----  BC5 In developing this Standard, the Board considered the findings of AASB Research Report 11 _Review of_  \n_Special Purpose Financial Statements: Large and Medium Sized Australian Charities_ and feedback\nobtained from the not-for-profit private sector regarding the public interest nature of the sector and the\nneeds of financial statement users with regard to the consistency and transparency of special purpose\nfinancial statements.  \nBC6 The research examining the reporting practices of large and medium charities lodging financial statements  \nwith the ACNC in 2016 estimates that approximately 36% of those charities declared that they were\npreparing special purpose financial statements based on data obtained from the 2016 Annual Information\nStatements lodged with the ACNC. It is estimated that, of those charities preparing and lodging special\npurpose financial statements, approximately 26% state compliance with recognition and measurement\nrequirements in Australian Accounting Standards. 30% state non-compliance with the recognition and\nmeasurements requirements in Australian Accounting Standards. It is not clear for the remaining 44%\nwhether or not they complied with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards.[4] Research also indicates that there are issues with the accuracy of charities stating they are\npreparing general purpose financial statements.[5]  \nBC7 In addition to it being difficult for the researchers to understand the extent of alignment of an entity\u2019s  \naccounting policies to the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards,\nthe researchers were also unable to ascertain whether or not an entity had fully consolidated its subsidiaries\nor equity accounted all its investments in associates and joint ventures.  \nBC8 The Board discussed the results of the research outlined above and also feedback obtained from respondents  \nto user surveys, along with evidence supporting the existence of users of financial statements, including\nspecial purpose financial statements.[6] The Board also noted the importance of consistency, comparability,\ntransparency and enforceability in financial reporting to special purpose financial statement users, and that\nat times users and other stakeholders were unaware that some special purpose financial statements (where\nthe preparation of financial statements in compliance with Australian Accounting Standards is required by\nlegislation or otherwise) did not comply with all the recognition and measurement requirements in\nAustralian Accounting Standards including consolidation. Adoption of the new disclosures in this Standard\nhelps address these issues.  \nBC9 The Board was also particularly concerned that the quality of disclosures in a significant number of special  \npurpose financial statements is not adequate to enable a user to determine what additional information they\nmight need. As noted in paragraph BC6 above research indicated that, for 44% of medium and large\ncharities lodging special purpose financial statements with the ACNC, it was unclear to the academics\nconducting the research whether or not the entities in question complied with the recognition and\nmeasurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards. The Board considers this to be\nunacceptable given the feedback received from users regarding consistency and transparency of special\npurpose financial statements including comparability of the recognition and measurement requirements\n(refer paragraph BC5 above).  \nBC10 In light of the Board\u2019s current broader project proposing to remove the ability for certain entities to prepare  \nspecial purpose financial statements when they are required to comply with Australian Accounting\nStandards,[7] the Board considered whether it was necessary and timely to require an entity preparing special\npurpose financial statements to disclose whether or not the accounting policies applied in the financial\nstatements comply with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards. These new disclosures are an interim measure aimed at addressing these concerns given the\nproject proposing to remove special purpose financial statements will take some time, particularly for the\nnot-for-profit entities.  \nBC11 In considering whether such disclosure was necessary, the Board also considered whether any existing  \ndisclosure requirements in Australian Accounting Standards or other pronouncements required the\ndisclosure of similar information.  \nBC12 The Board noted that paragraph 117 of AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, which applies not  \nonly to general purpose financial statements but also directly to the special purpose financial statements of  \n4 Research Report 11.\n5 Appendix 2, Research Report 11.\n6 Financial statements lodged with the ACNC are available from the ACNC\u2019s website for no cost, therefore it is reasonable to expect that  \nfinancial statements are being accessed by public users. Research Report 11 noted that of the approximately 16,000 charities lodging\nfinancial statements with the ACNC in 2016, approximately one third declared that they were preparing special purpose financial\nstatements.  \n7 This project proposes to remove ability for certain entities to prepare special purpose financial statements when they are required to  \ncomply with Australian Accounting Standards via a phased approach, firstly in relation to for-profit entities and, in due course, in\nrelation to not-for-profit entities.  \n-----  entities required to prepare financial reports in accordance with the _Corporations Act 2001,[8] requires an_\nentity to disclose its significant accounting policies. The Board also noted that, where it applies, paragraph\n6.1 of Accounting Professional and Ethical Standard APES 205 _Conformity with Accounting Standards_\n(October 2015) issued by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board (APESB) also requires\nthat an entity\u2019s special purpose financial statements clearly identify \u201cthe significant accounting policies\nadopted in the preparation of the special purpose financial statements\u201d.[9] The Board however noted that\nwhile these disclosures provide information about an entity\u2019s accounting policies, they would not\nnecessarily provide users with sufficient information about an entity\u2019s compliance with all the recognition\nand measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC13 On the basis of the considerations outlined in paragraphs BC2-BC12 above, the Board decided that an  \namendment to Australian Accounting Standards to require entities to disclose an explicit statement as to\nwhether or not the accounting policies applied in the financial statements comply with all the recognition\nand measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards was urgently needed to provide greater\ntransparency to users of publicly lodged special purpose financial statements and to improve the\ncomparability of special purpose financial statements. The Board also acknowledged that disclosure of this\ninformation is not sufficient to address the problems of special purpose financial reporting, however it\nprovides a practical interim means of improving the quality of information provided to users of special\npurpose financial statements.  \nBC14 The Board noted that, when preparing the required disclosure, entities would need to consider how their  \nexisting accounting policies compare with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian\nAccounting Standards. While the Board confirmed that the amendment would not require an entity to\nchange its existing accounting policies, understanding how closely the entity\u2019s existing accounting policies\nare aligned to the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards would\nalso help entities assess the impact of any future transition from special purpose financial statements to\ngeneral purpose financial statements.",

For example, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012, through section 60.30 of the Australian\n_Charities and Not\u2011 for\u2011 profits Commission Regulation 2013, requires charities lodging special purpose financial statements with the_\nACNC to comply with AASB 101, despite the fact that the application paragraph of that Standard does not directly encompass them.  \n9 Paragraph 6.1(c) of APES 205.\n10 Research Report 12 examined the financial reporting practices of for-profit entities, including large proprietary companies, small  \nforeign-controlled proprietary companies, for-profit unlisted public companies and other small proprietary companies, lodging financial\nstatements with ASIC. Research Report 12 noted that when performing their initial assessment as to whether or not the accounting\npolicies applied in the special purpose financial statements complied with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian  \n-----  (b) financial statement users have noted during AASB outreach to date[11] the lack of, and need to\nimprove, comparability, consistency, transparency and enforceability in special purpose financial\nstatements;  \n(c) the evidence of diversity in the application of, and compliance with, the recognition and\nmeasurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards in special purpose financial\nstatements noted in Research Report 11 (refer to paragraph BC6 above) and Research Report\n12;[12]  \n(d) the significant number of charities preparing special purpose financial statements and the low\nlevels of explicit statements of compliance with the recognition and measurement requirements in\nAustralian Accounting Standards therein (refer paragraph BC6 above); and  \n(e) the requirements of Australian Auditing Standards as they relate to special purpose financial\nstatements (refer to paragraph BC26 below).  \nBC19 When deciding which for-profit and not-for-profit entities should be required to make the disclosures  \nproposed in ED 293, the Board considered whether the disclosures should be required by:  \n(a) all entities preparing special purpose financial statements (including those preparing financial\nstatements voluntarily); or  \n(b) all entities preparing special purpose financial statements that are required by legislation or\notherwise to comply with Australian Accounting Standards; or  \n(c) only those entities preparing special purpose financial statements that are directly subject to\nAASB 101 and AASB 1054 _Australian Additional Disclosures[13], as set out in paragraph 2 of_\nAASB 1054 and paragraph 7 of AASB 1057 _Application of Australian Accounting Standards,_\n(and, indirectly, any entities required through legislation to comply with AASB 101 and\nAASB 1054, such as entities lodging special purpose financial statements with the ACNC as they\nare required by legislation to comply with AASB 101 and AASB 1054 (as noted in footnote 8 to\nparagraph BC12 above)).  \nBC20 The Board considered that while there was merit in requiring all entities required by legislation or otherwise  \nto comply with Australian Accounting Standards preparing special purpose financial statements to make the\ndisclosure proposed in ED 293 (ie those entities include paragraph BC19(b)), to do so was not warranted.\nThis is consistent with the current scope of Australian Accounting Standards and the Board\u2019s role and\nexpertise, which is to determine the appropriate accounting framework and accounting standards that should\napply where legislation, regulation or other authority requires the preparation of financial statements that\ncomply with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC21 The Board did acknowledge that if the disclosures were required only by entities subject to AASB 101 and  \nAASB 1054, there may be a large number of entities preparing special purpose financial statements when\nrequired to comply with Australian Accounting Standards that would not be required to make the\ndisclosures (eg entities outside the scope of the Corporations Act _2001 and entities not required to comply_\nwith the ACNC\u2019s reporting requirements applying to special purpose financial statements). The Board\nhowever made the observation that many of these entities are expected to fall within the scope of\nAPES 205, as the intention of APES 205 is to set requirements for members[14] who are involved in the\npreparation, presentation, audit, review or compilation of financial statements for entities that are outside\nthe scope of the _Corporations Act 2001. Therefore, to possibly mitigate (albeit not eliminate) concerns_\nabout entities outside the scope of AASB 101 and AASB 1054 not being required to make the disclosures,  \nAccounting Standards, it was initially unclear to the researchers whether or not 34% of the entities in question complied with the\nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards.  \n11 Such outreach included responses received on ITC 39, user surveys, participation of stakeholders at ITC 39 roundtable events and  \ntargeted outreach with not-for-profit private sector stakeholders.  \n12 Research Report 12 estimated that of those for-profit non-disclosing entities preparing and lodging special purpose financial statements  \n66% explicitly stated that they followed the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards, 10% were\nassessed to have complied with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards based on a\nqualitative review of the accounting policies, despite the absence of an explicit statement to that effect, 10% did not comply with the\nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards (of which only 0.5% clearly stated so), and the extent of\ncompliance (or otherwise) with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards of the remaining\n14% was unclear.  \n13 And AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows, AASB 108 and AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards, although they were not considered  \nappropriate candidates to give effect to the amendments proposed in ED 293, as noted in paragraph BC23 below.  \n14 APES 205 defines a member as \u201ca member of a professional body that has adopted this Standard as applicable to their membership as  \ndefined by that professional body\u201d. APES 205 is therefore applicable, to and mandatory for, accounting professionals who are members\nof CPA Australia, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand or the Institute of Public Accountants. This includes accountants\nworking in accounting firms (of all sizes), the corporate sector and in government. Therefore, although its reach is limited, it is broader\nthan that of AASB 1054.  \n-----  the matter was raised with staff of the APESB as to whether the APESB might consider, following its own\ndue process, making any consequential amendments to APES 205 consistent with the amendments to the\naffected Australian Accounting Standard proposed in ED 293. Subsequent to the issue of ED 293, the\nBoard noted that the matter was considered by the APESB, and that the APESB were not proposing\namendments to APES 205 (of a nature consistent with those proposed in ED 293) at that time, however they\ndid consider it an important issue to seek stakeholder views on. Accordingly, the Explanatory\nMemorandum to Exposure Draft 03/19 _Proposed revisions to APESB Pronouncements included_\ncommentary on this matter and sought specific feedback from their stakeholders. After considering this\nfeedback, the APESB decided not to amend APES 205.  \nBC22 For the reasons outlined in paragraph BC20-BC21 above, the Board decided it was not necessary to broaden  \nthe application paragraphs of AASB 101 or AASB 1054, and therefore ED 293 proposed the amendment\nshould apply in the manner described in paragraph BC19(c) above.  \nBC23 The Board then considered whether the disclosure requirement should be effected through AASB 101 or  \nAASB 1054. They were identified as the only two reasonable candidates as vehicles for housing the\nrequirements because they already have related requirements: AASB 101 includes requirements relating to\nthe disclosure of accounting policies and compliance with Standards, and AASB 1054 includes\nrequirements relating to compliance with Australian Accounting Standards and explicitly refers to special\npurpose financial statements. The Board\u2019s preferred approach was to amend AASB 1054 because the\namendment is Australian-specific, specifically relates to special purpose financial statements, and is\nconsistent with the objective of AASB 1054 \u201c\u2026 to set out Australian-specific disclosure requirements that\nare in addition to the disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards\u201d.  \n**Disclosures regarding the basis for the decision to prepare special purpose**\n**financial statements**  \nBC24 Paragraph 9 of AASB 1054 requires an entity to disclose whether the financial statements are general  \npurpose or special purpose. The Board decided that entities should also be required to disclose the reasons\nwhy the preparation of special purpose financial statements was considered appropriate.  \nBC25 In making this decision, the Board noted that APES 205 contains a requirement for entities to identify \u201cthe  \npurpose for which the Special Purpose Financial Statements have been prepared\u201d[15] and therefore entities\nwithin the scope of APES 205 should already be including this information in special purpose financial\nstatements, however mandating it in an Australian Accounting Standard would help ensure users are\nprovided with useful information.  \nBC26 The Board also noted the requirements of Australian Auditing Standards and the existing responsibilities of  \nthose charged with governance and auditors with respect to the selection and application of an entity\u2019s\nfinancial reporting framework. In particular, the Board noted the requirements in ASA 800 _Special_\n_Considerations \u2013 Audits of Financial Reports Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks_\nwhich for example require that \u201cthe auditor shall obtain an understanding of the steps undertaken by\nmanagement to determine that the applicable financial reporting framework is acceptable in the\ncircumstances\u201d[16] and also ASA 700 Forming an Opinion and Reporting on a Financial Report which for\nexample requires that \u201cthe auditor shall evaluate whether the financial report adequately refers to or\ndescribes the applicable financial reporting framework\u201d.[17]  \n**Disclosures regarding compliance with all the recognition and measurement**\n**requirements in Australian Accounting Standards**  \nBC27 When deciding what information about compliance with all the recognition and measurement requirements  \nin Australian Accounting Standards should be disclosed, the Board considered the following alternatives in\ndeveloping ED 293:  \n|Option|Information to be disclosed|\n|---|---|\n|Option 1|Contextual information about the entity, being where the entity has subsidiaries, investments in associates or investments in joint ventures, and whether or not they have been consolidated or equity accounted in a manner consistent with the requirements set out in Australian Accounting Standards.|  \n15 Paragraph 6.1(c) of APES 205.\n16 Paragraph 8 of ASA 800.\n17 Paragraph 15 of ASA 700.  \n-----  |Option|Information to be disclosed|\n|---|---|\n||If the entity has not consolidated its subsidiaries or equity accounted its investments in associates or joint ventures in a manner consistent with the requirements set out in Australian Accounting Standards, the entity shall disclose that fact and the reasons why. If the entity is a not-for-profit entity, and it has not determined whether or not its interests in other entities give rise to interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, the entity shall instead disclose that fact.|\n|Option 2|An explicit statement as to whether or not the financial statements comply with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards and, if not, an indication of where they do not comply.|\n|Option 3|Merely a binary statement regarding compliance or non-compliance with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards, for example either that \u201cthe entity has complied with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards\u201d or \u201cthe entity has not complied with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards\u201d.|\n|Option 4|Merely a statement of compliance with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards that is, no statement would be required if an entity did not comply with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards.|  \nBC28 The Board decided that Options 1 and 2 together were most appropriate, as they best inform financial  \nstatement users about the special purpose financial statements and best address the issues identified in\nparagraphs BC2-BC12 above.  \nBC29 In considering the application of Australian Accounting Standards to special purpose financial statements,  \nthe Board noted that section 45A of the _Corporations Act 2001 requires the assessment of thresholds for_\nsmall and large proprietary companies to be determined on a consolidated basis (ie the parent and the\nentities it controls (subsidiaries)) in accordance with the accounting standards even if the standards do not\notherwise apply to some or all of the companies concerned. For the purposes of this section, the question of\nwhether a proprietary company controls another entity is to be decided in accordance with the requirements\nof Australian Accounting Standards (ie AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements) even if the standards\ndo not otherwise apply to the company.  \nBC30 The Board considered whether an explicit statement that an entity does not have subsidiaries, or investments  \nin associates or joint ventures was required. The Board noted that entities preparing either Tier 1 or Tier 2\ngeneral purpose financial statements[18] are not required to make these statements and accordingly an explicit\nstatement in these circumstances should not be required.  \nBC31 The Board decided that in situations where an entity\u2019s financial statements do not consolidate some or all of  \nits subsidiaries, information about the consolidated financial statements of the entity\u2019s parent is likely to be\nuseful to enable financial statement users to at least be able to know if and where they can access some\nconsolidated information, even if it is incorporated into a wider group. While this requirement arguably\nimproves transparency in financial reporting, the Board decided not to mandatorily require disclosure of this\ninformation as such information is currently not required to be provided by entities preparing Tier 2 general\npurpose financial statements. The Board acknowledged that entities preparing Tier 2 general purpose\nfinancial statements would already be required to prepare consolidated financial statements and therefore\nsuch a disclosure would not be necessary as when preparing general purpose financial statements all\nsubsidiaries must be consolidated (unless the parent entity applies the exemption in AASB 10). Ultimately\nthis is one of the notable differences between special purpose financial statements and general purpose\nfinancial statements, as in contrast, where an entity is preparing special purpose financial statements, users\ncannot be sure whether an entity did not consolidate its subsidiaries due to the exemption in AASB 10 or\nwhether it was because it was determined that the group was not a reporting entity.  \nBC32 The Board also considered whether to require these entities to identify those subsidiaries that have not been  \nconsolidated. Whilst the Board acknowledged that this information might be useful to users of the financial\nstatements, the Board noted that for some entities, particularly those in the not-for-profit private sector, this\ndisclosure might be unduly burdensome, such as where entities are not required to determine whether they  \n18 \u201cAustralian Accounting Standards consist of two Tiers of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements:  \n(a) Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and\n(b) Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements.\u201d Paragraph 7 of AASB 1053.  \n-----  have subsidiaries in accordance with AASB 10 to assess their financial reporting requirements. Thus, on\nbalance, the Board decided that ED 293 would not require entities to disclose the identity of subsidiaries\nthat have not been consolidated.  \nBC33 The Board noted the general requirement in paragraph 117 of AASB 101 to disclose accounting policies  \nprovides financial statement users with an explanation of the basis upon which the financial statements have\nbeen prepared, but does not provide information regarding how those accounting policies compare with all\nthe recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards. Accordingly, the\ntransparency of special purpose financial reporting is compromised. The Board therefore decided that it\nwas necessary for an entity to explicitly disclose whether or not it complied with all the recognition and\nmeasurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards and to supplement that disclosure with an\nindication of where they do not comply.  \nBC34 In relation to the requirement to provide an indication of where non-compliance exists (for example, where  \nthe entity has not provided for employee entitlements in a manner consistent with the requirements set out\nin AASB 119 Employee Benefits), the Board decided to express a broad principle (ie an indication of where\nthe non-compliance exists) rather than take a more prescriptive approach (eg a description of the extent of\nnon-compliance). This was because, in the Board\u2019s view, the explanation of that disclosure requirement in\nparagraphs IG6-IG8 of the Implementation guidance and illustrative examples (as proposed in ED 293) and\nthe implementation guidance and illustrative examples themselves attached to AASB 1054 as nonmandatory material (see paragraph BC36 below) provide sufficient guidance for preparers to understand the\nnature of the information that is to be disclosed. As illustrated in the _Implementation guidance and_\n_illustrative examples (as proposed in ED 293),_ the approach taken by the Board also leaves discretion for\nentities to determine how best to make the disclosure having regard to their particular circumstances and the\nneeds of their users.  \nBC35 The Board did however confirm, that in disclosing the required information, the Board did not expect  \nentities to provide quantitative information or reconciliations where their accounting policies do not comply\nwith all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC36 The Board noted the view of some that, if the differences between an entity\u2019s accounting policies and the  \nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards are extensive, the\npreparation of the required disclosure could be onerous. To help address this concern, as referred to in\nparagraph BC34 above, the Board prepared a number of illustrative examples and flowcharts. The\n_Implementation guidance and illustrative examples_ (as proposed in ED 293) is designed to provide\nexamples of how the required information might be disclosed having regard to the existing variation and\ndiversity to compliance with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards in special purpose financial statements currently seen in practice.  \nBC37 The Board further noted the view that, depending on the current level of expertise, some entities might find  \nit burdensome to determine whether their accounting policies comply with the recognition and measurement\nrequirements in Australian Accounting Standards. The Board also made the observation that understanding\nwhether or not the entity has complied with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian\nAccounting Standards is a part of good governance and therefore it is reasonable to expect the necessary\nlevel of expertise is available, and any costs of acquiring that expertise would be reasonably expected to be\noutweighed by the benefits. Furthermore, the Board confirmed that the amendment would not require an\nentity to change its existing accounting policies and therefore is not onerous.  \nBC38 While Options 3 and 4 in the table in paragraph BC27 above were not without their advantages, the Board  \ndecided they were not the most appropriate alternatives for a number of reasons including:  \n(a) a binary disclosure stating only \u2018non-compliance\u2019 as suggested in Option 3 would not be useful as\nusers would not be able to discern an indication of the extent of recognition and measurement\ncompliance or non-compliance; and  \n(b) Option 4 was not appropriate as, if an entity did not make the disclosure, users would also not be\nable discern the reason for non-compliance, that is, whether it was a recognition and measurement\nnon-compliance or the omission of a disclosure requirement for example.  \nAccordingly, any costs that would be saved by adopting Options 3 or 4 relative to Option 2, including that\nthey would result in less voluminous disclosure, would be clearly outweighed by the benefits to users of\nOption 2.",

Accordingly, the Board noted the view that those responsible for the\npreparation of special purpose financial statements should determine the extent to which they conform with\nAustralian Accounting Standards and therefore it was not necessary for the Board to specify the disclosures\nproposed in ED 293.  \nBC40 Notwithstanding this, \u201cas part of moving legacy regulations out of legislation and into Australian  \nAccounting Standards \u2026\u201d,[19] and as noted in paragraph BC19(c) above, Australian Accounting Standards\nAASB 101, AASB 107, AASB 108, AASB 1048 and AASB 1054 apply to special purpose financial\nstatements. The Board considered that this, especially the requirement in paragraph 9 of AASB 1054,[20]\ntogether with the needs of users noted in paragraph BC18 above, provided a sufficient basis for requiring\nthe disclosures in special purpose financial statements proposed in ED 293. The Board was particularly\nconcerned that a significant number of special purpose financial statements do not provide adequate\ndisclosures to enable a user to determine whether they do need additional information to meet their needs.",

This is because the broader project proposing to remove the ability for certain\nfor-profit private sector entities to prepare special purpose financial statements when they are required to\ncomply with Australian Accounting Standards is expected to be completed by 30 June 2020.  \nBC44 The Board considered this feedback and decided that in order to better balance any additional costs with any  \nbenefits to financial statement users, it was necessary to limit the scope of this Standard to apply only to\nnot-for-profit private sector entities. This is because the broader project to remove the ability for certain\nnot-for-profit entities to prepare special purpose financial statements when required to comply with\nAustralian Accounting Standards would take some time. The Board also decided to amend the required\ndisclosures related to compliance with Australian Accounting Standards to reduce any costs that may be\nincurred in complying with the new disclosures.

The Board noted the ACNC expressed support for increased\ntransparency of financial reporting in the charities sector with the additional disclosure requirements being\nviewed as a positive step towards greater transparency, accountability and good governance.  \nBC46 As noted in paragraph BC44 above, the disclosure requirements were amended (refer paragraphs BC48\nBC57 below) to not require not-for-profit private sector entities to undertake more effort than they already\nhave in regards to assessing compliance or otherwise with the recognition and measurement requirements in\nAustralian Accounting Standards, as they could state that they have not made an assessment of compliance  \n19 Paragraph 14 of both _The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and_ _The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-_  \n_Setting Framework._  \n20 Paragraph 9 of AASB 1054 requires an entity to disclose whether the financial statements are general purpose financial statements or  \nspecial purpose financial statements.  \n-----  with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards (refer paragraph\nBC49) if they wish to. The Board acknowledged that there is less clarity regarding compliance with the\nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards in the special purpose\nfinancial statements of charities and considered that the new disclosures provide appropriate information for\nusers without these entities incurring undue costs. The Board also confirmed the new disclosures should\napply to not-for-profit private sector entities for annual reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2020.  \nBC47 When deciding to limit the application of this Standard to not-for-profit private sector entities only, the  \nBoard noted feedback from respondents to ED 293 (refer paragraph BC43 above) that if the proposals in\nED 297 Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for Certain For-Profit Private Sector Entities to\nremove the ability for certain for-profit private sector entities to prepare special purpose financial statements\nare finalised as proposed, so that they are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July\n2020, the requirements of this Standard would only be relevant for a short period of time for these for-profit\nprivate sector entities. The Board therefore considered that the costs to prepare the disclosures in this\nStandard for these for-profit private sector entities would arguably outweigh the benefits. If however the\nproposals in ED 297 are not finalised as proposed, the Board will reconsider the application of the\nrequirements in this Standard for for-profit private sector entities.",

        "page_content=": "### Disclosure requirements\nBC48 In order to simplify the new disclosures and minimise any possible burden associated with preparing the  \nnew disclosures, the Board decided to amend the disclosure requirements to adopt a two-step approach to\nassessing and disclosing compliance with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian\nAccounting Standards and also clarified a number of other aspects of the disclosure requirements.  \nBC49 The Board decided that not-for-profit private sector entities required to apply this Standard should assess,  \nfor each material accounting policy applied and disclosed in the special purpose financial statements,\nwhether the policy does not comply with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian\nAccounting Standards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128 Investments in Associates\n_and Joint Ventures). If a material accounting policy does not comply with the recognition and measurement_\nrequirements in Australian Accounting Standards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or\nAASB 128), that fact shall be disclosed with an indication of how it does not comply. Alternatively, if a\nnot-for-profit private sector entity has not made this assessment, it should disclose that fact.  \nBC50 After making the disclosures noted in paragraph BC49, the not-for-profit private sector entity will then  \ndisclose, whether the financial statements overall:  \n(a) comply with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards\n(except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128) - that is there are no material\naccounting policies disclosed in the special purpose financial statements that would not comply\nand have not been assessed in respect of the recognition and measurement requirements in\nAustralian Accounting Standards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128);  \n(b) do not comply with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128) - that is there are one or\nmore instances of material accounting policies disclosed in the special purpose financial\nstatements that do not comply with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian\nAccounting Standards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128); or  \n(c) compliance with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128) has not been assessed that is there are one or more instances where the not-for-profit private sector entity has not\nassessed whether or not the material accounting policies disclosed in the special purpose financial\nstatements comply with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128).  \nBC51 The Board decided to include an option for a not-for-profit private sector entity to disclose that they have  \nnot assessed whether or not the accounting policies disclosed in the special purpose financial statements\ncomply with all the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards (except\nfor requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128), because allowing an entity to make such a disclosure\nwould require minimal additional effort (as entities would not be required to complete additional assessment\nof compliance with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards but\nmerely make the disclosures based on their existing understanding of the entity\u2019s accounting policies). This\ndisclosure, however, would highlight potential instances of non-compliance with the recognition and\nmeasurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards to users of the special purpose financial\nstatements, as well as potential governance issues, and would also allow users of the special purpose\nfinancial statements to seek additional information if required.  \n-----  BC52 The Board confirmed that it is their expectation that the new disclosures are intended to identify instances  \nof non-compliance with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards\nthat are material to the special purpose financial statements. The Board considered whether an entity that\nhas disclosed non-compliance with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian\nAccounting Standards (except for requirements set out in AASB 10 or AASB 128) for an accounting policy\nthat is not material to the entity, could still claim that its financial statements overall complied with the\nrecognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards. The Board confirmed if\nthere is one instance of a material accounting policy applied and disclosed in the special purpose financial\nstatements not complying with the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting\nStandards or not being assessed, the entity cannot claim that its financial statements overall comply with all\nthe recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC53 The Board acknowledged the diversity in views regarding whether or not consolidation and the equity  \nmethod of accounting are recognition and measurement requirements, presentation and disclosure\nrequirements, neither or both, and the effect this diversity in views may have on the ability of an entity to\ndetermine whether or not they have complied with all the recognition and measurement requirements in\nAustralian Accounting Standards.  \nBC54 The Board considered whether the recent amendment to paragraph 9 of AASB 1053 made via AASB 2019\n1 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 References to the Conceptual Framework clarified_\nthat consolidation and the equity method of accounting are recognition and measurement requirements,\nhowever noted that the intention of this amendment was to provide certainty that an entity not consolidating\nor equity accounting must apply the transitional provisions in AASB 1 or AASB 108, and the Board had\ndetermined to not make a conclusive decision on it.  \nBC55 For the avoidance of doubt the Board decided to make it clear that for the purposes of the disclosures in  \nparagraphs 9A(c) and 9A(d) of this Standard, recognition and measurement requirements exclude\nconsolidation and the equity method of accounting as the application of consolidation and the equity method\nof accounting are the subject of separate disclosure requirements in this Standard.  \nBC56 The Board also reconsidered the proposal in ED 293 to relieve a not-for-profit entity from the requirement  \nto determine whether or not its interests in other entities give rise to interests in subsidiaries, associates or\njoint ventures. The Board acknowledged that there may be some instances where a not-for-profit private\nsector entity may be required by legislation to make this determination to assess their financial reporting\nrequirements, and therefore decided that this relief should only be available where there is no legislative\nrequirement for a not-for-profit entity to make this determination. For example, and as noted in paragraph\nBC29, section 45A of the Corporations Act 2001 requires the assessment of thresholds for small and large\nproprietary companies to be determined on a consolidated basis (ie the parent and the entities it controls\n(subsidiaries)) in accordance with the accounting standards even if the standards do not otherwise apply to\nsome or all of the companies concerned. While it is not common, it is possible for a not-for-profit entity to\nbe structured using a proprietary company structure and the entity would therefore be subject to section 45A\nof the Corporations Act 2001.  \nBC57 The _Implementation guidance and illustrative examples for not-for-profit private sector entities was_  \nupdated to reflect these decisions of the Board.",

The Board\u2019s intention is that for-profit publicly\naccountable entities that comply with Australian Accounting Standards should be able to assert compliance\nwith IFRS Standards.  \nBC3 The Board noted that, without these amendments, this would not be possible in a situation where an entity\u2019s\nreporting date falls between the date of the IASB issuing an IFRS Standard and the AASB issuing the\ncorresponding Australian Accounting Standard, as the AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in_\n_Accounting Estimates and Errors disclosure requirements would not apply in relation to that IFRS_\nStandard. Under these circumstances, an entity would not be able to assert compliance with IFRS Standards\nunless it elected to make the disclosures set out in paragraphs 30 and 31 of AASB 108 in relation to that\nIFRS Standard.  \nBC4 The Board decided to add an additional disclosure requirement to AASB 1054 _Australian Additional_\n_Disclosures requiring an entity that intends to comply with IFRS Standards to disclose the information in_\nparagraphs 30 and 31 of AASB 108 on the potential effect on the entity\u2019s financial statements of an IFRS\nStandard that has not yet been issued by the Board. This disclosure requirement will be particularly\nrelevant to for-profit publicly accountable entities seeking IFRS compliance. Not-for-profit entities need\nnot provide the disclosures if they are not able to or are not seeking to comply with IFRS Standards.  \nBC5 The disclosures set out in paragraphs 30 and 31 are not required of Tier 2 entities under Australian\nAccounting Standards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements. Similarly, these disclosures are not proposed to\nbe required of Tier 2 entities in Exposure Draft ED 295 General Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified\n_Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities._ Therefore, the Board decided it would be\nappropriate not to require Tier 2 entities to provide the disclosures in relation to new IFRS Standards not yet\nissued in Australia. Tier 2 entities preparing general purpose financial statements under the Reduced\nDisclosure Requirements will not be in compliance with IFRS Standards, and so such entities could not\nintend to comply with IFRS Standards. Although the disclosure requirement therefore would not apply to\nTier 2 entities, the Board decided to make explicit the non-application to Tier 2 entities.  \nBC6 The Board also noted that the New Zealand equivalent of AASB 1054, Financial Reporting Standard\nFRS 44 New Zealand Additional Disclosures, has been amended similarly in relation to IFRS Standards that\nhave not yet been issued in New Zealand. _The_ _AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework_\nrequires that, wherever possible, differences between accounting standards issued in Australia and New\nZealand should be minimised to reduce costs for entities operating trans-Tasman.",

        "page_content=": "## Reasons for issuing this Standard  \nBC3 In 2018 the Board initiated a broad project to address the issues associated with special purpose financial  \nstatements (SPFS) reporting in the for-profit private sector.[1] As part of that project, the Board proposed,\nthrough Exposure Draft ED 297 Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for Certain For-Profit\nPrivate Sector Entities (August 2019), to remove the option for some types of for-profit private sector\nentities to prepare SPFS when they are required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS).\nED 297 proposed an operative date of annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020 and led to\nthe issue of AASB 2020-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Removal of Special Purpose\nFinancial Statements for Certain For-Profit Private Sector Entities (March 2020). AASB 2020-2, operative\ninstead for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2021, made amendments to AAS to disallow the\npreparation of SPFS by the following entities (and, consistent with that, to also remove the \u2018reporting entity\u2019\nconcept for them):  \n(a) entities required by legislation to prepare financial statements that comply with either AAS or\naccounting standards; and  \n(b) entities required by their constituting document or another document to prepare financial\nstatements that comply with AAS, provided the relevant document was created or amended on or\nafter 1 July 2021 (to coincide with AASB 2020-2\u2019s operative date).  \nThe Basis for Conclusions accompanying AASB 2020-2 explains the Board\u2019s reasons for the decisions it\nmade in that Standard and provides more information about the issues with SPFS reporting. (The Basis for\nConclusions is also published with AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards.)  \nBC4 Given the limited scope of AASB 2020-2, the problems associated with SPFS prepared by for-profit private\nsector entities that are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS were not entirely\nresolved. This is because AASB 2020-2:  \n(a) did not become immediately operative (AASB 2020-2 was issued in March 2020); and  \n(b) contains an exemption that allows for-profit private sector entities that are required only by their\nconstituting document or another document to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS  \n1 Public sector entities were excluded from the scope of this broad project because the Board had a separate project addressing the public  \nsector financial reporting framework.  \n-----  to continue preparing SPFS if the relevant document was created before 1 July 2021 and not\namended on or after that date.  \nBC5 The continued preparation of SPFS that state compliance with AAS without further explanation, whether\ntemporarily (until an entity transitioned to general purpose financial statements (GPFS) in accordance with\nAASB 2020-2) or for the foreseeable future (in relation to entities referred to in paragraph BC4(b)),\nremained a concern to the Board. Consistent with the _AASB Evidence-Informed Standard-Setting_\n_Framework, the Board decided to address its concern by considering whether to issue a Standard having_\nregard to the evidence it gathered through outreach to stakeholders and other forms of research. That\nresearch evinced users\u2019 clearly stated views on the importance of understanding the recognition and\nmeasurement (R&M) basis of preparation of financial statements. The Board also noted the findings of\nAASB Research Report 12 _Financial Reporting Practices of For-Profit Entities Lodging Special Purpose_\n_Financial Statements (August 2019), which indicated the current deficiencies in clearly reporting the basis_\nof preparation in SPFS (see also paragraphs BC20-BC22 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2020-2).  \nBC6 The Board noted some stakeholders were concerned about a lack of research-based evidence that\ndemonstrates disclosure requirements would assist users\u2019 understanding of SPFS prepared by entities within\nthe scope of this Standard. This concern arose because AASB Research Report 12 is based on data relating\nto entities within the scope of AASB 2020-2, rather than the types of entities referred to in paragraph\nBC4(b), and in any event it predates the change in proprietary company reporting thresholds under the\n_Corporations Act 2001 and therefore does not provide any current analysis. However, the Board came to_\nthe view that the Research Report provides evidence by analogy as there is no basis to expect that SPFS of\nthe types of entities referred to in paragraph BC4(b) would have adopted better disclosure practices than the\nSPFS of the types of entities that were the focus of the Research Report (see paragraph BC7). Furthermore,\nthe evidence provided by the Research Report was supplemented by the findings of outreach undertaken in\nDecember 2018 to understand users\u2019 views as part of improving the Australian Financial Reporting\nFramework, which was considered by the Board at its April 2020 meeting (see paragraph BC8).  \nBC7 AASB Research Report 12 indicated that for 34% of examined entities preparing and lodging SPFS with the\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in 2018, the extent of compliance with R&M\nrequirements in AAS was not clear. After a detailed, qualitative assessment of the accounting policies of\nthese unclear SPFS by the researchers, Research Report 12 concluded:  \n(a) 10% of the total population of SPFS did not appear to be following all R&M requirements in\nAAS, despite only 0.5% of the total clearly stating so;  \n(b) 76% appeared to follow all R&M requirements in AAS; and  \n(c) the extent of compliance (or otherwise) with the R&M requirements in AAS of the remaining\n14% of SPFS was unclear.  \nBC8 The December 2018 research conducted via a survey of users of financial statements prepared by for-profit\nprivate sector entities found:  \n(a) on average, 93% of primary users and more than 95% of other users said comparability,\ntransparency, comprehensibility and consistency are what they need most in financial statements;\nand  \n(b) only 43% of primary users and 56% of other users said they are satisfied with the information\npresented in SPFS.  \nRespondents to this survey were generally involved with entities within the scope of AASB 2020-2,\nalthough there were a number involved with the types of entities referred to in paragraph BC4(b), such as\nlimited partnerships, incorporated associations and trusts. On that basis, the Board concluded the findings\nof the research are relevant in supporting the Board\u2019s view that users of SPFS prepared by entities within\nthe scope of this Standard would benefit from specific SPFS disclosure requirements.  \nBC9 In light of ED 297\u2019s limited scope and anticipating the proposals in ED 297 would not be reflected in a\nStandard for some time after ED 297 was published for comment, the Board had also issued Exposure Draft\nED 293 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Disclosure in Special Purpose Financial_\n_Statements of Compliance with Recognition and Measurement Requirements (July 2019). ED 293 proposed_\nrequiring for-profit and not-for-profit private sector entities lodging SPFS with either the ASIC or the\nAustralian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) to disclose information in their SPFS that\nwould allow users to understand the extent of compliance or otherwise of the entity\u2019s accounting policies\nwith the R&M requirements in AAS.[2]  \n2 In relation to for-profit private sector entities, the proposals were developed as an interim measure while the Board continued with its  \nED 297 proposals.  \n-----  BC10 The feedback received on ED 293 indicated the majority of respondents agreed the proposals would\nincrease the transparency and comparability of SPFS. However, due to the short time within which the\nproposed requirements would become mandatory in light of the expected timing of the release of a Standard\nbased on ED 297\u2019s proposals, respondents were particularly concerned about the costs of the proposals\nexceeding any benefits for for-profit private sector entities. This is because the proposal in ED 297 to\nremove the ability for certain for-profit private sector entities to prepare SPFS when they are required to\ncomply with AAS was expected to be completed and, as noted in paragraph BC3, operative for annual\nreporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020.  \nBC11 After considering this feedback, the Board decided at that time the proposals in ED 293 should apply only\nto not-for-profit private sector entities. The Board decided it would revisit the application of the proposals\nin ED 293 for for-profit private sector entities if the proposals in ED 297 were not finalised as proposed.\nConsequently, the Board issued AASB 2019-4 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013_\n_Disclosure in Special Purpose Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Private Sector Entities on Compliance_\n_with Recognition and Measurement Requirements (November 2019), operative for annual reporting periods_\nending on or after 30 June 2020.  \nBC12 As indicated in paragraph BC3, the Board decided the effective date of AASB 2020-2 should be one year\nlater than what was proposed in ED 297. It arrived at this decision after considering feedback from\nrespondents to ED 297 that entities needed more time to prepare for the implementation of the proposals \u2013\nsee also the reasons noted in paragraph BC149 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2020-2. As a\nconsequence of the deferral of the effective date, the Board decided it was necessary to revisit the proposals\nin ED 293 in relation to for-profit private sector entities that were not yet required to apply AASB 2020-2,\nas well as for the types of entities referred to in paragraph BC4(b). Consequently, ED 302 was issued in\nJune 2020, which as noted in paragraph BC2 led to the development of this Standard.",

        "page_content=": "## Scope  \nBC14 When considering which for-profit private sector entities should be required to make the ED 302 proposed\ndisclosures,[3] the Board considered whether the disclosures should be required by:  \n(a) only those entities preparing SPFS that are directly subject to AASB 1054 Australian Additional\n_Disclosures_ (for example, an entity with a direct reference to application of AASB 1054 in its\ntrust deed); or  \n(b) those for-profit private sector entities that are required by legislation (eg Part 2M.3 of the\n_Corporations Act 2001_ or other legislation) to prepare financial statements that comply with\neither AAS or accounting standards, and other for-profit private sector entities that are required\nonly by their constituting document or another document to prepare financial statements that\ncomply with AAS provided the relevant document was created before 1 July 2021 and not\namended on or after that date; or  \n(c) those entities referred to in option (b), with a threshold to limit the requirements to those entities\nthat would meet the requirements to be considered a large proprietary company under the\nCorporations Act; or  \n(d) those entities referred to in option (b), but only where their SPFS state they have been prepared in\ncompliance with AAS.  \nBC15 For the purposes of ED 302, the Board decided to propose option (b), noting:  \n(a) option (a) would not achieve the objective of the proposed amendments as it would not include all\nentities with a non-legislative requirement to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS;  \n(b) option (c) was not the most appropriate alternative as it would be relatively complex to apply. It\nwould also add to the overall complexity of AAS because it would result in exemptions for\ncertain entities that are already subject to exemptions (in particular, the scope exemptions from\nthe removal of SPFS for for-profit private sector entities made in AASB 2020-2);  \n3 With limited exceptions, consistent with transaction neutrality the proposed disclosures in ED 302 for for-profit entities were based on  \nthe disclosures specified in AASB 2019-4 for not-for-profit entities.  \n-----  (c) option (d) was not the most appropriate alternative for similar reasons to option (c). In addition,\nthe Board was concerned this option might allow any resulting disclosure requirements to be\nreadily circumvented simply through non-disclosure of compliance with AAS, despite an entity\u2019s\nconstituting document requiring compliance with AAS without explicitly requiring disclosure of\ncompliance with AAS; and  \n(d) in adopting option (b), the Board did not expect the proposed disclosures in ED 302 to be\nonerous. However, it acknowledged that implementing option (b) in paragraph BC14 by making\namendments to the application of AASB 1054 (via AASB 1057) would result in a number of\nentities becoming subject to AASB 1054 for the first time. Furthermore, the Board noted AASB\n1054 specifies disclosures that are potentially beyond the scope of the project that gave rise to this\nStandard. For this reason, ED 302 proposed limiting the application of the existing disclosure\nrequirements in AASB 1054 for those entities preparing SPFS. Consequently, ED 302 proposed\nthat such entities should only be required to comply with proposed paragraph 9C (and paragraph\n9D referring to implementation guidance is also relevant) in applying AASB 1054. That\napproach would leave it to the entities to decide with which other disclosure requirements in AAS\nto comply, based on their assessment of the needs of the users of their SPFS.  \nBC16 ED 302 also proposed specific amendments to paragraph 2 of AASB 1057 to extend the set of entities to\nwhich AASB 1057 applies. This was necessary in order to extend the set of entities to which AASB 1054\napplies and give effect to option (b) in paragraph BC14. The amendments to AASB 1057 proposed in ED\n302 would not extend the application of any other AAS to the for-profit private sector entities covered by\nthe proposals (see also paragraphs BC19-BC21).",

        "page_content=": "## Disclosure of accounting policies  \nBC18 The Board noted many entities within the scope of the proposed amendments in ED 302 were not required\nby AAS to disclose information about the accounting policies applied in their SPFS. Without this,\ninformation about the extent of the entity\u2019s compliance or otherwise with the R&M requirements in AAS\nmight be incomplete. Therefore, the Board decided to include in ED 302 a proposal to require entities to\ndisclose information about the material accounting policies applied, including the measurement basis (or\nbases) used and information about changes in those accounting policies, such as the nature of the change\nand the reasons why the change was made.  \nBC19 The Board noted that entities required by legislation to prepare financial reports in accordance with AAS or\naccounting standards are generally required to comply with AASB 101 _Presentation of Financial_\n_Statements, AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows, AASB 108 Accounting Policies,_ _Changes in Accounting_\n_Estimates and Errors, AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards and AASB 1054, even in preparing SPFS._\nFor example, this is specified in paragraph 7 of AASB 1057 for entities within the scope of Part 2M.3 of the\nCorporations Act. Entities registered with the ACNC are also specifically required to comply with those\nStandards by the _Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012. However, such_\nrequirements do not apply to entities within the scope of this Standard, which simply have a reference to\nAAS in their constituting or other documents, rather than in legislation.  \nBC20 In that regard, the Board considered proposing to expand the scope of AASB 101, AASB 107, AASB 108\nand AASB 1048 consistent with the proposed expanded scope of AASB 1054, but decided not to do so.\nThis was because, while the Board saw merit in this approach, requiring all entities within the scope of the\nproposed amendments to AASB 1054 to comply with all the requirements contained in those Standards was\nconsidered too onerous.  \nBC21 The Board also noted that if the approach considered in paragraph BC20 were to be adopted, as the\nStandards referred to in that paragraph contain certain R&M requirements (such as accrual accounting and  \n-----  applying the going concern basis of preparation), this would then impose a requirement on all entities\nwithin the scope of the proposed amendments to adopt minimum R&M requirements. The Board concluded\nsetting minimum R&M requirements in SPFS was beyond the objective of ED 302 (and beyond the\nobjective of this Standard).",

Most significantly, the Board noted AASB 2019-4\ncontains options for a not-for-profit private sector entity to disclose in its SPFS that it has not assessed\ncertain aspects that would otherwise be required to be assessed and disclosed. Those aspects are:  \n(a) whether or not the entity\u2019s interests in other entities give rise to interests in subsidiaries,\nassociates or joint ventures for financial reporting purposes; and  \n(b) whether or not the entity\u2019s material accounting policies comply with the R&M requirements in\nAAS.  \nBC24 These options were included in AASB 2019-4 because:  \n(a) for entities in the not-for-profit private sector, disclosure of compliance might be unduly\nburdensome, such as where entities are not required to determine whether they have subsidiaries\nin accordance with AASB 10 _Consolidated Financial Statements to assess their financial_\nreporting requirements (paragraph BC32 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2019-4); and  \n(b) allowing an entity to make a no-assessment disclosure would require minimal additional effort,\nbut would highlight potential instances of non-compliance with the R&M requirements in AAS to\nusers of the SPFS, as well as potential governance issues, and would also allow users of the SPFS\nto seek additional information if required (paragraph BC51 of the Basis for Conclusions on\nAASB 2019-4).  \nBC25 The Board acknowledged those for-profit private sector entities with a non-legislative requirement to\nprepare financial statements that comply with AAS might benefit from being able to disclose they have not\nassessed compliance with certain AAS requirements, for reasons consistent with those noted in paragraph\nBC24. However, the Board took the view for-profit private sector entities typically would be expected to\nhave access to the resources necessary to make the required assessments and should therefore have an\nunderstanding of the R&M requirements in AAS under a good-governance approach to financial reporting.\nThe Board also considered that while many of these entities might be small in size, they typically would not\nhave overly complex accounting requirements or transactions in this case, and this assessment would\ntherefore be relatively straightforward.  \nBC26 The Board considered that the reasons outlined in paragraphs BC24 and BC25 meet the requirements of the\nstandard-setting frameworks as justifiable reasons why for-profit and not-for-profit private sector entities\nshould have different disclosure requirements.  \nBC27 The Board also noted that although it did not expect these disclosures to be onerous for for-profit private\nsector entities, those entities would still have the option of changing their constituting or other documents to\navoid reference to AAS should they wish to do so, which would scope them out of this Standard.",

This was particularly the case for those for-profit private sector entities with a\nlegislative requirement to comply with AAS, given the proposals for these entities were proposed to be\neffective from 1 July 2020 and therefore would apply for only one year.

In\nparagraph BC85 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2020-2, the Board explained that these entities were\nexcluded from the scope of AASB 2020-2 and therefore permitted to continue preparing SPFS because they\nprepare financial statements for specific users, have no external regulator and the financial statements are\nnot lodged on the public record. However, the Board remained concerned about the lack of transparency of\nSPFS that continue to refer to AAS. As a result, to help ensure users are adequately informed, it came to\nthe view the SPFS of these entities should be required to disclose information about the extent of their\ncompliance or otherwise with the R&M requirements in AAS. In addition, the Board noted anecdotally\nthere would be some types of entities, such as securitised trading trusts, outside the scope of AASB 2020-2\n(and therefore permitted to continue preparing SPFS) but lodging SPFS on the public record that are\nrequired only by their constituting document or another document to comply with AAS. Accordingly, in\nthe absence of this Standard, there would be publicly available SPFS that do not necessarily specify whether\nor not they comply with R&M requirements of AAS, despite being required by a constituting or other\ndocument to comply with AAS. The Board was concerned this would not satisfy the needs of users.  \nBC37 The Board also considered whether to broaden the scope of the requirements in this Standard to other\nentities that are not currently within the application paragraphs of AAS set out in AASB 1057, such as\nentities voluntarily preparing SPFS or entities preparing SPFS due to a requirement in their constituting  \n-----  document or another document to present a \u2018true and fair view\u2019 or to comply with \u2018GAAP\u2019 (whether\ngenerally accepted accounting principles or generally accepted accounting practices), without those terms\nbeing explicitly defined or specified as AAS. However, the Board decided the scope of this Standard\nshould not include such entities for the same reasons it did not include them in the application paragraphs of\nAAS (see paragraph BC79 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2020-2).  \nBC38 As noted in paragraph BC34, the Board decided to exclude from the scope of this Standard for-profit private\nsector entities required by legislation to prepare financial statements that comply with either AAS or\naccounting standards (ie entities within the scope of AASB 2020-2). This acknowledges what would\notherwise be a short-term effect of the proposals in ED 302 for these entities, caused by delays in the issue\nof this Standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the Board\u2019s work program. The Board noted\nthat, at the time of issuing ED 302, the implications of COVID-19 could not have been predicted. The basis\nfor this decision is consistent with the reason for the earlier decision to exclude for-profit private sector\nentities from the scope of AASB 2019-4 (see paragraph BC47 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 20194).  \nBC39 The Board concluded that excluding these entities from this Standard would allow them to use the extra\ntime to prepare for transitioning to GPFS in accordance with AASB 2020-2 and it would be a reasonable\nand pragmatic way of providing some resource relief during the pandemic. The Board also concluded\nexcluding these entities would have a limited adverse effect on users and, on that basis, the Board accepted\nthe practical arguments expressed by some stakeholders that the introduction of new disclosure\nrequirements for these entities would add unreasonable incremental time to prepare and audit SPFS for\nyears ending on or after 30 June 2021.",

        "page_content=": "## Disclosure regarding accounting policies for joint operations  \nBC41 Some respondents to ED 302 expressed a view that joint operations within the scope of AASB 11 _Joint_\n_Arrangements should be excluded from the requirement to disclose overall compliance with R&M_\nrequirements. They argued this by analogy with how ED 302 proposed dealing with disclosures about an\nentity\u2019s accounting policies relating to subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. The Board concluded that\nan exclusion for joint operations (in addition to the exclusion for subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures)\nis not required and would not be appropriate. This is because paragraph 20 of AASB 11 requires a joint\noperator, being the entity preparing the financial statements (whether consolidated or unconsolidated), to\nrecognise its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in a joint operation \u2013 and therefore it is\nclearly an R&M requirement. The Board also noted paragraph 21 of AASB 11 clarifies that the\nrequirements relating to the entity\u2019s share of those amounts are accounted for in accordance with the\nrequirements (including R&M) of other relevant AAS. The definition of a joint operation also confirms\nthis, on the basis that it refers to the entity\u2019s rights and obligations to the assets and liabilities. Therefore,\nnon-compliance with AASB 11 as it applies to joint operations would be a clear non-compliance with R&M\nrequirements in AAS.  \nBC42 Given the nature of joint operations, their accounting treatment is fundamentally different from that of\nsubsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As such, it would be inappropriate to also exclude them from the\noverall R&M disclosure required by this Standard, potentially implying they are not R&M requirements.  \n-----  The Board also noted that paragraphs 9C(e) and 9C(f) of this Standard are consistent with paragraph 9C(d),\nwhich also does not refer to AASB 11.",

The Board had considered the\nsame issue in the context of not-for-profit private sector entities in the development of AASB 2019-4. At\nthat time the Board noted entities preparing either Tier 1 or Tier 2 GPFS are not required to make such a\nstatement. Consistent with that, the Board decided an explicit statement would not be required in SPFS of\nnot-for-profit private sector entities, as noted in paragraph BC30 of the Basis for Conclusions on AASB\n2019-4. The Board also noted that, in any event, users of financial statements could reasonably be expected\nto be able to discern from the absence of the other disclosures (eg paragraph 9C(d) of AASB 1054, which\nresults in disclosures only when the entity has interests in other entities) that the entity has no subsidiaries or\ninterests in associates or joint ventures.

In\nresponse, the Board noted that, like AASB 2019-4, this Standard follows a two-step approach (first\nparagraph 9C(e) and then paragraph 9C(f)) to assessing and disclosing compliance or otherwise with the\nR&M requirements in AAS (other than AASB 10 and AASB 128). This approach is designed to minimise\nthe burden associated with preparing the disclosures by having entities assess first whether or not their\nmaterial accounting policies comply with AAS R&M requirements, and then whether the financial\nstatements overall comply with AAS R&M requirements. If all material accounting policies comply with\nAAS R&M requirements, there is no disclosure to be made under paragraph 9C(e), which is why paragraph\n9C(f) is useful as a way to make clear to users the financial statements do in fact comply with all R&M\nrequirements. Although the Board noted AAS usually only require an entity to disclose where they have\nnot complied with AAS requirements, in this case requiring an entity to disclose it has complied is useful\nfor users and is not an onerous requirement. Furthermore, without paragraph 9C(f), if an entity has one or\nmore instances of material non-compliance with R&M requirements, without disclosing overall noncompliance it may not be readily evident to users that this is the case.  \nBC45 The Board reaffirmed its decision to not provide entities within the scope of this Standard an option to state\nthey have not assessed compliance with certain AAS requirements. The Board noted the contrary view that\nallowing a \u2018not assessed\u2019 option might be a means of responding to cost/benefit concerns expressed by\nrespondents to ED 302, whilst still providing useful information that would put users on notice that the\nfinancial statements might not comply with all the R&M requirements in AAS. However, consistent with\nthe reasons in paragraph BC25 and the fact the Board had not identified any new arguments in the responses\nto ED 302, the Board did not accept that contrary view. The Board also noted deferral of the effective date\nas mentioned in paragraph BC51 would provide entities with sufficient time to consider any possible\ncomplexities or challenges in making the disclosures, and therefore the \u2018not assessed\u2019 option was not\nwarranted.",

For example, where the entity elects\nto not disclose related party transactions, it should be required to disclose its election not to make any\ndisclosures under AASB 124 _Related Party Disclosures. The Board considered that while disclosures_\nregarding omitted AAS disclosures might be useful for users of SPFS, the scope of this Standard and the\nrelated amendments are aimed at increasing the transparency and comparability of SPFS in relation to\ncompliance with the R&M requirements in AAS rather than AAS disclosure requirements. The Board also\nnoted this matter was previously considered as part of the feedback received on ED 293 and the Board\ndecided against requiring additional AAS disclosures as it was beyond the scope of the project that resulted  \n-----  in AASB 2019-4.

This was on the basis that the Framework states \u201cthe AASB currently does not set\nrecognition and measurement requirements for SPFS. This is because SPFS should only be prepared where\nusers can tailor the SPFS to their own information needs and therefore do not need a standard-setter or\nregulator to specify the accounting policies or require disclosure of the information for them.\u201d  \nBC48 The Board considered this view in light of its decision relating to disclosures in SPFS of not-for-profit\nprivate sector entities as reflected in AASB 2019-4. The Board acknowledged that the appropriateness of\nthe justifications noted in the Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2019-4 (in particular paragraph BC40) for\nrejecting these respondents\u2019 views are less apparent for entities within the scope of this Standard, but\nnonetheless concluded this Standard is justifiable under the Framework. The Framework notes the Board\ndoes not set R&M requirements for SPFS. In this Standard, the Board is adding limited disclosure\nrequirements for SPFS, in the same way as it did for not-for-profit private sector entities under AASB 20194.

However, the Board concluded this Standard is justified for the reasons\nindicated in paragraphs BC3-BC12 and on the basis the Board\u2019s acknowledgement of the history of AAS\nreferences in constituting documents is the main reason the Board decided on only contextual disclosures\nfor SPFS rather than requiring a more onerous transition to GPFS by entities within the scope of the\nStandard. Furthermore, overall, the Board concluded the requirements in this Standard are commensurate\nwith the evidence from the research outlined in paragraphs BC5-BC8. Additional research would unduly\ndelay the project and would only be justified if the requirements were to be more onerous, such as\nmandating R&M requirements.  \nBC50 Paragraph 18 of the AASB For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework (July 2021) states: \u201cEnforcement\nof the preparation of financial statements and compliance with Accounting Standards is the responsibility of\nother regulators ... It is not the responsibility of the AASB.\u201d Consistent with that, the Board noted its role\nand expertise in relation to this Standard is to determine the appropriate accounting framework and\naccounting standards that should apply where financial statements are required by constituting or other\ndocuments to comply with AAS. Requiring additional disclosures in SPFS to provide greater transparency\nand comparability regarding compliance with the R&M requirements in AAS is consistent with this role.",

This effectively deferred the proposed operative date\nby 12 months. In making this decision the Board acknowledged anecdotal feedback that some issues faced\nby small entities within the scope of this Standard might be more complex than originally thought. After\nthe issuance of ED 302, the Board became aware that in some instances, for example when applying AASB\n15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers or AASB 119 Employee Benefits, it may be difficult for smaller\nentities to determine whether they are complying with the R&M requirements in AAS, such as an entity\ncalculating employee benefits (eg long service leave) when they have staff with long tenure.  \nBC52 Consistent with the Board\u2019s view in paragraph BC34, the Board concluded deferring the proposed operative\ndate by 12 months (with early adoption allowed) would give entities within the scope of this Standard\nenough time to prepare for the implementation of the disclosures. It would also be a way for the Board to\naddress the fact that the economic impact of COVID-19 has been significant, is ongoing, and could not have\nbeen predicted when issuing ED 302 and proposing an operative date.  \nBC53 Given subsequent delays in finalising this Standard, the Board revised the operative date to periods ending\non or after 30 June 2022, which in substance covers the same periods as periods beginning on or after 1 July  \n-----  2021.
