Recognition**\n**of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to the conditions specified in**\n**paragraphs 11 and 12.**  \n-----  _Recognition conditions_  \n11 To qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the _Conceptual Framework for_\n_Financial Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards) at the acquisition date. For_\nexample, costs the acquirer expects but is not obliged to incur in the future to effect its plan to exit an\nactivity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of or relocate an acquiree\u2019s employees are not\nliabilities at the acquisition date. Therefore, the acquirer does not recognise those costs as part of applying\nthe acquisition method. Instead, the acquirer recognises those costs in its post-combination financial\nstatements in accordance with other Australian Accounting Standards.  \nAusCF11 Notwithstanding paragraph 11, in respect of AusCF entities, to qualify for recognition as part of\napplying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must\nmeet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the _Framework for the Preparation and_\n_Presentation of Financial Statements (as identified in AASB 1048_ _Interpretation of_\n_Standards)[AusCF1] at the acquisition date. For example, costs the acquirer expects but is not obliged_\nto incur in the future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the\nemployment of or relocate an acquiree\u2019s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date.\nTherefore, the acquirer does not recognise those costs as part of applying the acquisition method.\nInstead, the acquirer recognises those costs in its post-combination financial statements in\naccordance with other Australian Accounting Standards.  \n12 In addition, to qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed must be part of what the acquirer and the acquiree (or its former _owners)_\nexchanged in the business combination transaction rather than the result of separate transactions. The\nacquirer shall apply the guidance in paragraphs 51\u201353 to determine which assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed are part of the exchange for the acquiree and which, if any, are the result of separate transactions to\nbe accounted for in accordance with their nature and the applicable Australian Accounting Standards.  \n13 The acquirer\u2019s application of the recognition principle and conditions may result in recognising some assets\nand liabilities that the acquiree had not previously recognised as assets and liabilities in its financial\nstatements. For example, the acquirer recognises the acquired identifiable intangible assets, such as a brand\nname, a patent or a customer relationship, that the acquiree did not recognise as assets in its financial\nstatements because it developed them internally and charged the related costs to expense.  \n14 Paragraphs B31\u2013B40 provide guidance on recognising intangible assets. Paragraphs 21A\u201328B specify the\ntypes of identifiable assets and liabilities that include items for which this Standard provides limited\nexceptions to the recognition principle and conditions.  \n_Classifying or designating identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a_\n_business combination_  \n**15** **At the acquisition date, the acquirer shall classify or designate the identifiable assets acquired and**\n**liabilities assumed as necessary to apply other Australian Accounting Standards subsequently. The**\n**acquirer shall make those classifications or designations on the basis of the contractual terms,**\n**economic conditions, its operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as they exist**\n**at the acquisition date.**  \n16 In some situations, Australian Accounting Standards provide for different accounting depending on how an\nentity classifies or designates a particular asset or liability. Examples of classifications or designations that\nthe acquirer shall make on the basis of the pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date include\nbut are not limited to:  \n(a) classification of particular financial assets and liabilities as measured at fair value through profit\nor loss or at amortised cost, or as a financial asset measured at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments;  \n(b) designation of a derivative instrument as a hedging instrument in accordance with AASB 9; and  \n(c) assessment of whether an embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract in\naccordance with AASB 9 (which is a matter of \u2018classification\u2019 as this Standard uses that term).  \nAusCF1 In respect of AusCF entities, in December 2013 the AASB amended the _Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of_  \n_Financial Statements._  \n-----  17 This Standard provides an exception to the principle in paragraph 15:  \n(a) classification of a lease contract in which the acquiree is the lessor as either an operating lease or\na finance lease in accordance with AASB 16 Leases.  \n(b) [deleted]  \nThe acquirer shall classify those contracts on the basis of the contractual terms and other factors at the\ninception of the contract (or, if the terms of the contract have been modified in a manner that would change\nits classification, at the date of that modification, which might be the acquisition date).  \nAus17.1 Public sector entities applying AASB 4 _Insurance Contracts shall apply an exception to the_\nprinciple in paragraph 15 to the classification of a contract as an insurance contract.

The**\n**measurement period ends as soon as the acquirer receives the information it was seeking about facts**\n**and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not**\n**obtainable. However, the measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.**  \n46 The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the\nprovisional amounts recognised for a business combination. The measurement period provides the acquirer\nwith a reasonable time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the following as of the\nacquisition date in accordance with the requirements of this Standard:  \n(a) the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the\nacquiree;  \n(b) the consideration transferred for the acquiree (or the other amount used in measuring goodwill);  \n(c) in a business combination achieved in stages, the equity interest in the acquiree previously held\nby the acquirer; and  \n(d) the resulting goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase.  \n47 The acquirer shall consider all pertinent factors in determining whether information obtained after the\nacquisition date should result in an adjustment to the provisional amounts recognised or whether that\ninformation results from events that occurred after the acquisition date. Pertinent factors include the date\nwhen additional information is obtained and whether the acquirer can identify a reason for a change to\nprovisional amounts. Information that is obtained shortly after the acquisition date is more likely to reflect\ncircumstances that existed at the acquisition date than is information obtained several months later. For\nexample, unless an intervening event that changed its fair value can be identified, the sale of an asset to a\nthird party shortly after the acquisition date for an amount that differs significantly from its provisional fair\nvalue measured at that date is likely to indicate an error in the provisional amount.  \n48 The acquirer recognises an increase (decrease) in the provisional amount recognised for an identifiable asset\n(liability) by means of a decrease (increase) in goodwill. However, new information obtained during the\nmeasurement period may sometimes result in an adjustment to the provisional amount of more than one\nasset or liability. For example, the acquirer might have assumed a liability to pay damages related to an\naccident in one of the acquiree\u2019s facilities, part or all of which are covered by the acquiree\u2019s liability\ninsurance policy. If the acquirer obtains new information during the measurement period about the\nacquisition-date fair value of that liability, the adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the\nprovisional amount recognised for the liability would be offset (in whole or in part) by a corresponding\nadjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the claim\nreceivable from the insurer.  \n49 During the measurement period, the acquirer shall recognise adjustments to the provisional amounts as if\nthe accounting for the business combination had been completed at the acquisition date. Thus, the acquirer\nshall revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed, including\nmaking any change in depreciation, amortisation or other income effects recognised in completing the\ninitial accounting.  \n-----  50 After the measurement period ends, the acquirer shall revise the accounting for a business combination only\nto correct an error in accordance with AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates_\n_and Errors._",

This gives rise to assets\nand liabilities and a gain or loss of the transferee local government. A restructure of local\ngovernments may take the form of a new local government being constituted and other local\ngovernments being abolished as a result of a State government\u2019s policy to effectively amalgamate\na number of local governments.  \nAus63.4 A restructure of local governments involves a change in the resources controlled by the local\ngovernments involved in the restructure.

The transferred assets will usually be recognised\nby the transferee at their carrying amounts in the books of the transferor at the time of the\ntransfer. Such amounts provide a practical basis for recognising the transfer of assets, particularly\nwhen many assets are involved, as is usually the case in a restructure of local governments.\nHowever, the recognition of transferred assets at fair value is permitted by this Standard.  \nAus63.5 The restructures of local governments referred to in paragraphs Aus63.3 and Aus63.4 do not\ninvolve transfers between the local government and its ownership group but give rise to a gain or\nloss that is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  \n**Aus63.6** **Assets and liabilities transferred during the reporting period and recognised in accordance**\n**with paragraph Aus63.1 shall be disclosed separately, by class, by way of note or otherwise,**\n**and the transferor local government shall be identified.**  \n**Aus63.7** **Any gain or loss recognised in accordance with paragraph Aus63.1 shall be separately**\n**disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.**  \nAus63.8 The disclosures required by paragraph Aus63.6 will assist users to identify the assets and\nliabilities recognised as a result of a restructure separately from other assets and liabilities and to\nidentify the transferor local government. In addition, the disclosures required by paragraph\nAus63.7 will assist users to identify separately the gain or loss which results from a restructure of\nlocal governments.  \nAus63.9 Local governments are not required to apply paragraphs 59 to 63 and the related Appendix B\nApplication Guidance paragraphs of this Standard when disclosing information about restructures\nof local governments.",

The previous version of the Standard applied prospectively to business combinations\nfor which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2009 and could be applied at the beginning of an annual reporting\nperiod that begins on or after 30 June 2007.  \n-----  65A Contingent consideration balances arising from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the\ndate when an entity first applied this Standard as issued in 2008 shall not be adjusted upon first application\nof this Standard. Paragraphs 65B\u201365E shall be applied in the subsequent accounting for those balances.\nParagraphs 65B\u201365E shall not apply to the accounting for contingent consideration balances arising from\nbusiness combinations with acquisition dates on or after the date when the entity first applied this Standard\nas issued in 2008. In paragraphs 65B\u201365E business combination refers exclusively to business combinations\nwhose acquisition date preceded the application of this Standard as issued in 2008.  \n65B If a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent\non future events, the acquirer shall include the amount of that adjustment in the cost of the combination at\nthe acquisition date if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.  \n65C A business combination agreement may allow for adjustments to the cost of the combination that are\ncontingent on one or more future events. The adjustment might, for example, be contingent on a specified\nlevel of profit being maintained or achieved in future periods, or on the market price of the instruments\nissued being maintained. It is usually possible to estimate the amount of any such adjustment at the time of\ninitially accounting for the combination without impairing the reliability of the information, even though\nsome uncertainty exists. If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the\nbusiness combination shall be adjusted accordingly.  \n65D However, when a business combination agreement provides for such an adjustment, that adjustment is not\nincluded in the cost of the combination at the time of initially accounting for the combination if it either is\nnot probable or cannot be measured reliably. If that adjustment subsequently becomes probable and can be\nmeasured reliably, the additional consideration shall be treated as an adjustment to the cost of the\ncombination.  \n65E In some circumstances, the acquirer may be required to make a subsequent payment to the seller as\ncompensation for a reduction in the value of the assets given, equity instruments issued or liabilities\nincurred or assumed by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree. This is the case, for example,\nwhen the acquirer guarantees the market price of equity or debt instruments issued as part of the cost of the\nbusiness combination and is required to issue additional equity or debt instruments to restore the originally\ndetermined cost. In such cases, no increase in the cost of the business combination is recognised. In the case\nof equity instruments, the fair value of the additional payment is offset by an equal reduction in the value\nattributed to the instruments initially issued. In the case of debt instruments, the additional payment is\nregarded as a reduction in the premium or an increase in the discount on the initial issue.  \n66 An entity, such as a mutual entity, that has not yet applied AASB 3 and had one or more business\ncombinations that were accounted for using the purchase method shall apply the transition provisions in\nparagraphs B68 and B69.",

A\nbusiness combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in\nwhich all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both\nbefore and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory.  \nB2 A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an entity when, as a result of contractual\narrangements, they collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain\nbenefits from its activities. Therefore, a business combination is outside the scope of this Standard when the\nsame group of individuals has, as a result of contractual arrangements, ultimate collective power to govern\nthe financial and operating policies of each of the combining entities so as to obtain benefits from their\nactivities, and that ultimate collective power is not transitory.  \nB3 An entity may be controlled by an individual or by a group of individuals acting together under a\ncontractual arrangement, and that individual or group of individuals may not be subject to the financial\nreporting requirements of Australian Accounting Standards. Therefore, it is not necessary for combining\nentities to be included as part of the same consolidated financial statements for a business combination to be\nregarded as one involving entities under common control.  \nB4 The extent of non-controlling interests in each of the combining entities before and after the business\ncombination is not relevant to determining whether the combination involves entities under common\ncontrol. Similarly, the fact that one of the combining entities is a subsidiary that has been excluded from the\nconsolidated financial statements is not relevant to determining whether a combination involves entities\nunder common control.",

The concentration test\nhas the following consequences:  \n(a) if the concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business\nand no further assessment is needed.  \n(b) if the concentration test is not met, or if the entity elects not to apply the test, the entity shall then\nperform the assessment set out in paragraphs B8\u2013B12D.  \nB7B The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated\nin a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. For the concentration test:  \n(a) gross assets acquired shall exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill\nresulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities.  \n(b) the fair value of the gross assets acquired shall include any consideration transferred (plus the fair\nvalue of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest) in excess\nof the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired.

However, if the fair value of the gross\nassets acquired is more than that total, a more precise calculation may sometimes be needed.  \n(c) a single identifiable asset shall include any asset or group of assets that would be recognised and\nmeasured as a single identifiable asset in a business combination.  \n(d) if a tangible asset is attached to, and cannot be physically removed and used separately from,\nanother tangible asset (or from an underlying asset subject to a lease, as defined in AASB 16\n_Leases), without incurring significant cost, or significant diminution in utility or fair value to_\neither asset (for example, land and buildings), those assets shall be considered a single\nidentifiable asset.  \n(e) when assessing whether assets are similar, an entity shall consider the nature of each single\nidentifiable asset and the risks associated with managing and creating outputs from the assets\n(that is, the risk characteristics).  \n(f) the following shall not be considered similar assets:  \n(i) a tangible asset and an intangible asset;  \n-----  (ii) tangible assets in different classes (for example, inventory, manufacturing equipment\nand automobiles) unless they are considered a single identifiable asset in accordance\nwith the criterion in subparagraph (d);  \n(iii) identifiable intangible assets in different classes (for example, brand names, licences\nand intangible assets under development);  \n(iv) a financial asset and a non-financial asset;  \n(v) financial assets in different classes (for example, accounts receivable and investments\nin equity instruments); and  \n(vi) identifiable assets that are within the same class of asset but have significantly different\nrisk characteristics.  \nB7C The requirements in paragraph B7B do not modify the guidance on similar assets in AASB 138 _Intangible_\n_Assets; nor do they modify the meaning of the term \u2018class\u2019 in AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment,_\nAASB 138 and AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.",

Moreover, if an acquired set of activities and\nassets was generating revenue at the acquisition date, it is considered to have outputs at that date, even if\nsubsequently it will no longer generate revenue from external customers, for example because it will be\nintegrated by the acquirer.  \nB12B If a set of activities and assets does not have outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of\nprocesses) shall be considered substantive only if:  \n(a) it is critical to the ability to develop or convert an acquired input or inputs into outputs; and  \n(b) the inputs acquired include both an organised workforce that has the necessary skills, knowledge,\nor experience to perform that process (or group of processes) and other inputs that the organised\nworkforce could develop or convert into outputs. Those other inputs could include:  \n(i) intellectual property that could be used to develop a good or service;  \n(ii) other economic resources that could be developed to create outputs; or  \n-----  (iii) rights to obtain access to necessary materials or rights that enable the creation of future\noutputs.  \nExamples of the inputs mentioned in subparagraphs (b)(i)\u2013(iii) include technology, in-process research and\ndevelopment projects, real estate and mineral interests.  \nB12C If a set of activities and assets has outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of\nprocesses) shall be considered substantive if, when applied to an acquired input or inputs, it:  \n(a) is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an\norganised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process\n(or group of processes); or  \n(b) significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and:  \n(i) is considered unique or scarce; or  \n(ii) cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue\nproducing outputs.  \nB12D The following additional discussion supports both paragraphs B12B and B12C:  \n(a) an acquired contract is an input and not a substantive process. Nevertheless, an acquired contract,\nfor example, a contract for outsourced property management or outsourced asset management,\nmay give access to an organised workforce. An entity shall assess whether an organised\nworkforce accessed through such a contract performs a substantive process that the entity\ncontrols, and thus has acquired. Factors to be considered in making that assessment include the\nduration of the contract and its renewal terms.  \n(b) difficulties in replacing an acquired organised workforce may indicate that the acquired organised\nworkforce performs a process that is critical to the ability to create outputs.  \n(c) a process (or group of processes) is not critical if, for example, it is ancillary or minor within the\ncontext of all the processes required to create outputs.",

If a business combination has occurred but applying the guidance\nin AASB 10 does not clearly indicate which of the combining entities is the acquirer, the factors in\nparagraphs B14\u2013B18 shall be considered in making that determination.  \nB14 In a business combination effected primarily by transferring cash or other assets or by incurring liabilities,\nthe acquirer is usually the entity that transfers the cash or other assets or incurs the liabilities.  \nB15 In a business combination effected primarily by exchanging equity interests, the acquirer is usually the\nentity that issues its equity interests. However, in some business combinations, commonly called \u2018reverse\nacquisitions\u2019, the issuing entity is the acquiree. Paragraphs B19\u2013B27 provide guidance on accounting for\nreverse acquisitions. Other pertinent facts and circumstances shall also be considered in identifying the\nacquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity interests, including:  \n(a) _the relative voting rights in the combined entity after the business combination\u2014The acquirer is_\nusually the combining entity whose owners as a group retain or receive the largest portion of the\nvoting rights in the combined entity. In determining which group of owners retains or receives the\nlargest portion of the voting rights, an entity shall consider the existence of any unusual or special\nvoting arrangements and options, warrants or convertible securities.  \n(b) _the existence of a large minority voting interest in the combined entity if no other owner or_\n_organised group of owners has a significant voting interest\u2014The acquirer is usually the_\ncombining entity whose single owner or organised group of owners holds the largest minority\nvoting interest in the combined entity.  \n(c) _the composition of the governing body of the combined entity\u2014The acquirer is usually the_\ncombining entity whose owners have the ability to elect or appoint or to remove a majority of the\nmembers of the governing body of the combined entity.  \n(d) _the composition of the senior management of the combined entity\u2014The acquirer is usually the_\ncombining entity whose (former) management dominates the management of the combined\nentity.  \n-----  (e) _the terms of the exchange of equity interests\u2014The acquirer is usually the combining entity that_\npays a premium over the pre-combination fair value of the equity interests of the other combining\nentity or entities.  \nB16 The acquirer is usually the combining entity whose relative size (measured in, for example, assets, revenues\nor profit) is significantly greater than that of the other combining entity or entities.  \nB17 In a business combination involving more than two entities, determining the acquirer shall include a\nconsideration of, among other things, which of the combining entities initiated the combination, as well as\nthe relative size of the combining entities.  \nB18 A new entity formed to effect a business combination is not necessarily the acquirer. If a new entity is\nformed to issue equity interests to effect a business combination, one of the combining entities that existed\nbefore the business combination shall be identified as the acquirer by applying the guidance in paragraphs\nB13\u2013B17.

Both the technology patent and the related licence agreement meet the contractuallegal criterion for recognition separately from goodwill even if selling or exchanging the patent\nand the related licence agreement separately from one another would not be practical.  \nB33 The separability criterion means that an acquired intangible asset is capable of being separated or divided\nfrom the acquiree and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a\nrelated contract, identifiable asset or liability. An intangible asset that the acquirer would be able to sell,\nlicense or otherwise exchange for something else of value meets the separability criterion even if the\nacquirer does not intend to sell, license or otherwise exchange it. An acquired intangible asset meets the\nseparability criterion if there is evidence of exchange transactions for that type of asset or an asset of a\nsimilar type, even if those transactions are infrequent and regardless of whether the acquirer is involved in\nthem. For example, customer and subscriber lists are frequently licensed and thus meet the separability\ncriterion. Even if an acquiree believes its customer lists have characteristics different from other customer\nlists, the fact that customer lists are frequently licensed generally means that the acquired customer list\nmeets the separability criterion. However, a customer list acquired in a business combination would not\nmeet the separability criterion if the terms of confidentiality or other agreements prohibit an entity from\nselling, leasing or otherwise exchanging information about its customers.  \nB34 An intangible asset that is not individually separable from the acquiree or combined entity meets the\nseparability criterion if it is separable in combination with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability.\nFor example:  \n(a) market participants exchange deposit liabilities and related depositor relationship intangible assets\nin observable exchange transactions. Therefore, the acquirer should recognise the depositor\nrelationship intangible asset separately from goodwill.  \n(b) an acquiree owns a registered trademark and documented but unpatented technical expertise used\nto manufacture the trademarked product. To transfer ownership of a trademark, the owner is also\nrequired to transfer everything else necessary for the new owner to produce a product or service\nindistinguishable from that produced by the former owner. Because the unpatented technical\nexpertise must be separated from the acquiree or combined entity and sold if the related\ntrademark is sold, it meets the separability criterion.",

For example, an acquirer may attribute value to the existence of an assembled\nworkforce, which is an existing collection of employees that permits the acquirer to continue to operate an\nacquired business from the acquisition date. An assembled workforce does not represent the intellectual\ncapital of the skilled workforce\u2014the (often specialised) knowledge and experience that employees of an\nacquiree bring to their jobs. Because the assembled workforce is not an identifiable asset to be recognised\nseparately from goodwill, any value attributed to it is subsumed into goodwill.  \nB38 The acquirer also subsumes into goodwill any value attributed to items that do not qualify as assets at the\nacquisition date. For example, the acquirer might attribute value to potential contracts the acquiree is\nnegotiating with prospective new customers at the acquisition date. Because those potential contracts are\nnot themselves assets at the acquisition date, the acquirer does not recognise them separately from goodwill.\nThe acquirer should not subsequently reclassify the value of those contracts from goodwill for events that\noccur after the acquisition date. However, the acquirer should assess the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding events occurring shortly after the acquisition to determine whether a separately recognisable\nintangible asset existed at the acquisition date.  \nB39 After initial recognition, an acquirer accounts for intangible assets acquired in a business combination in\naccordance with the provisions of AASB 138 _Intangible Assets. However, as described in paragraph 3 of_\nAASB 138, the accounting for some acquired intangible assets after initial recognition is prescribed by\nother Australian Accounting Standards.  \nB40 The identifiability criteria determine whether an intangible asset is recognised separately from goodwill.\nHowever, the criteria neither provide guidance for measuring the fair value of an intangible asset nor restrict\nthe assumptions used in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset. For example, the acquirer would\ntake into account the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the intangible asset, such\nas expectations of future contract renewals, in measuring fair value. It is not necessary for the renewals\nthemselves to meet the identifiability criteria. (However, see paragraph 29, which establishes an exception\nto the fair value measurement principle for reacquired rights recognised in a business combination.)\nParagraphs 36 and 37 of AASB 138 provide guidance for determining whether intangible assets should be\ncombined into a single unit of account with other intangible or tangible assets.",

In addition, the acquirer in a\ncombination of mutual entities shall recognise the acquiree\u2019s net assets as a direct addition to capital or\nequity in its statement of financial position, not as an addition to retained earnings, which is consistent with\nthe way in which other types of entities apply the acquisition method.  \nB48 Although they are similar in many ways to other businesses, mutual entities have distinct characteristics that\narise primarily because their members are both customers and owners.

Understanding the reasons why the acquisition agreement includes a provision for contingent\npayments, who initiated the arrangement and when the parties entered into the arrangement may be helpful\nin assessing the nature of the arrangement.  \nB55 If it is not clear whether an arrangement for payments to employees or selling shareholders is part of the\nexchange for the acquiree or is a transaction separate from the business combination, the acquirer should\nconsider the following indicators:  \n(a) _Continuing employment\u2014The terms of continuing employment by the selling shareholders who_\nbecome key employees may be an indicator of the substance of a contingent consideration\narrangement. The relevant terms of continuing employment may be included in an employment\nagreement, acquisition agreement or some other document. A contingent consideration\narrangement in which the payments are automatically forfeited if employment terminates is\nremuneration for post-combination services. Arrangements in which the contingent payments are\nnot affected by employment termination may indicate that the contingent payments are additional\nconsideration rather than remuneration.  \n(b) _Duration of continuing employment\u2014If the period of required employment coincides with or is_\nlonger than the contingent payment period, that fact may indicate that the contingent payments\nare, in substance, remuneration.  \n(c) _Level of remuneration\u2014Situations in which employee remuneration other than the contingent_\npayments is at a reasonable level in comparison with that of other key employees in the combined\nentity may indicate that the contingent payments are additional consideration rather than\nremuneration.  \n(d) _Incremental payments to employees\u2014If selling shareholders who do not become employees_\nreceive lower contingent payments on a per-share basis than the selling shareholders who become\nemployees of the combined entity, that fact may indicate that the incremental amount of\ncontingent payments to the selling shareholders who become employees is remuneration.  \n(e) _Number of shares owned\u2014The relative number of shares owned by the selling shareholders who_\nremain as key employees may be an indicator of the substance of the contingent consideration\narrangement. For example, if the selling shareholders who owned substantially all of the shares in\nthe acquiree continue as key employees, that fact may indicate that the arrangement is, in\nsubstance, a profit-sharing arrangement intended to provide remuneration for post-combination\nservices. Alternatively, if selling shareholders who continue as key employees owned only a\nsmall number of shares of the acquiree and all selling shareholders receive the same amount of\ncontingent consideration on a per-share basis, that fact may indicate that the contingent payments\nare additional consideration. The pre-acquisition ownership interests held by parties related to\nselling shareholders who continue as key employees, such as family members, should also be\nconsidered.  \n(f) _Linkage to the valuation\u2014If the initial consideration transferred at the acquisition date is based_\non the low end of a range established in the valuation of the acquiree and the contingent formula\nrelates to that valuation approach, that fact may suggest that the contingent payments are\nadditional consideration. Alternatively, if the contingent payment formula is consistent with prior\nprofit-sharing arrangements, that fact may suggest that the substance of the arrangement is to\nprovide remuneration.  \n(g) _Formula for determining consideration\u2014The formula used to determine the contingent payment_\nmay be helpful in assessing the substance of the arrangement. For example, if a contingent\npayment is determined on the basis of a multiple of earnings, that might suggest that the\nobligation is contingent consideration in the business combination and that the formula is\nintended to establish or verify the fair value of the acquiree. In contrast, a contingent payment that\nis a specified percentage of earnings might suggest that the obligation to employees is a profitsharing arrangement to remunerate employees for services rendered.  \n-----  (h) _Other agreements and issues\u2014The terms of other arrangements with selling shareholders (such_\nas agreements not to compete, executory contracts, consulting contracts and property lease\nagreements) and the income tax treatment of contingent payments may indicate that contingent\npayments are attributable to something other than consideration for the acquiree. For example, in\nconnection with the acquisition, the acquirer might enter into a property lease arrangement with a\nsignificant selling shareholder. If the lease payments specified in the lease contract are\nsignificantly below market, some or all of the contingent payments to the lessor (the selling\nshareholder) required by a separate arrangement for contingent payments might be, in substance,\npayments for the use of the leased property that the acquirer should recognise separately in its\npost-combination financial statements. In contrast, if the lease contract specifies lease payments\nthat are consistent with market terms for the leased property, the arrangement for contingent\npayments to the selling shareholder may be contingent consideration in the business combination.",

Exchanges of share options or other share-based payment awards in conjunction\nwith a business combination are accounted for as modifications of share-based payment awards in\naccordance with AASB 2 Share-based Payment. If the acquirer replaces the acquiree awards, either all or a\nportion of the market-based measure of the acquirer\u2019s replacement awards shall be included in measuring\nthe consideration transferred in the business combination. Paragraphs B57\u2013B62 provide guidance on how to\nallocate the market-based measure. However, in situations in which acquiree awards would expire as a\nconsequence of a business combination and if the acquirer replaces those awards when it is not obliged to\ndo so, all of the market-based measure of the replacement awards shall be recognised as remuneration cost\nin the post-combination financial statements in accordance with AASB 2. That is to say, none of the\nmarket-based measure of those awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the\nbusiness combination. The acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree awards if the acquiree or its\nemployees have the ability to enforce replacement. For example, for the purposes of applying this guidance,\nthe acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree\u2019s awards if replacement is required by:  \n(a) the terms of the acquisition agreement;  \n(b) the terms of the acquiree\u2019s awards; or  \n(c) applicable laws or regulations.  \nB57 To determine the portion of a replacement award that is part of the consideration transferred for the acquiree\nand the portion that is remuneration for post-combination service, the acquirer shall measure both the\nreplacement awards granted by the acquirer and the acquiree awards as of the acquisition date in accordance\nwith AASB 2. The portion of the market-based measure of the replacement award that is part of the\nconsideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree equals the portion of the acquiree award that is\nattributable to pre-combination service.  \nB58 The portion of the replacement award attributable to pre-combination service is the market-based measure\nof the acquiree award multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of\nthe total vesting period or the original vesting period of the acquiree award. The vesting period is the period\nduring which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. Vesting conditions are defined in\nAASB 2.  \nB59 The portion of a non-vested replacement award attributable to post-combination service, and therefore\nrecognised as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements, equals the total market-based\nmeasure of the replacement award less the amount attributed to pre-combination service. Therefore, the\nacquirer attributes any excess of the market-based measure of the replacement award over the market-based\nmeasure of the acquiree award to post-combination service and recognises that excess as remuneration cost\nin the post-combination financial statements. The acquirer shall attribute a portion of a replacement award\nto post-combination service if it requires post-combination service, regardless of whether employees had\nrendered all of the service required for their acquiree awards to vest before the acquisition date.  \nB60 The portion of a non-vested replacement award attributable to pre-combination service, as well as the\nportion attributable to post-combination service, shall reflect the best available estimate of the number of\nreplacement awards expected to vest. For example, if the market-based measure of the portion of a\nreplacement award attributed to pre-combination service is CU100 and the acquirer expects that only 95 per\ncent of the award will vest, the amount included in consideration transferred in the business combination is\nCU95.

An entity shall apply\nthose amendments when it applies IFRS 10.  \n64F IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, issued in May 2011, amended paragraphs 20, 29, 33, 47, amended the\ndefinition of fair value in Appendix A and amended paragraphs B22, B40, B43\u2013B46, B49 and B64. An\nentity shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 13.  \n64G _Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27), issued in October 2012, amended_\nparagraph 7 and added paragraph 2A. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning\non or after 1 January 2014. Earlier application of Investment Entities is permitted. If an entity applies these\namendments earlier it shall also apply all amendments included in Investment Entities at the same time.  \n65 Assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the\napplication of this Standard shall not be adjusted upon application of this Standard.  \n68 This IFRS supersedes IFRS 3 Business Combinations (as issued in 2004).  \nB68 Paragraph 64 provides that this IFRS applies prospectively to business combinations for which the\nacquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July\n2009. Earlier application is permitted. However, an entity shall apply this IFRS only at the beginning of an\nannual reporting period that begins on or after 30 June 2007. If an entity applies this IFRS before its\neffective date, the entity shall disclose that fact and shall apply IAS 27 (as amended in 2008) at the same\ntime.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Significant Issues  \nBC2 The AASB issued a revised AASB 3 _Business Combinations in March 2008. At that time, the Board_\ndecided that the requirements of AASB 3 (March 2008) should only be available for early adoption by forprofit entities, until further work was undertaken on the implications of applying the requirements of\nAASB 3 (March 2008) to not-for-profit entities. Accordingly, the Board included in the Preface to AASB 3\n(March 2008) the following statement:  \nPrior to the mandatory application date of this Standard, being 1 July 2009, the AASB will consider its\nsuitability for combinations among not-for-profit entities. In doing so, the AASB will have regard to\nthe criteria being developed for judging when IFRSs should be modified for application by not-forprofit entities. Those criteria will assist in clarifying whether this Standard should be amended to\ninclude an additional scope exclusion or other amendments and, if so, the extent of that exclusion or\nother amendments in an Australian not-for-profit context. In light of this, not-for-profit entities cannot\nadopt this Standard prior to the mandatory application date.  \nBC3 As part of its subsequent deliberations, the Board noted the view of some that the difficulties in applying the\nacquisition method when a business combination does not involve consideration (including the difficulties\nof identifying an acquirer), which is often the case in business combinations among not-for-profit entities,\nmeans that the principles in AASB 3 (March 2008) are inappropriate for such combinations. However, the\nBoard decided that, in principle, there is no conceptual basis for accounting for business combinations\namong not-for-profit entities differently from other analogous types of business combinations.  \nBC4 In particular, the Board noted that the types of difficulties noted in paragraph BC3 are also issues that may\nbe encountered in business combinations of for-profit entities (such as combinations by contract alone).\nTherefore, consistent with transaction-neutral principles, the Board did not consider that there was sufficient\nreason to justify a different accounting treatment for business combinations among not-for-profit entities.  \nBC5 The Board observed that the motivations for business combinations among not-for-profit entities, such as to\nprovide their beneficiaries with a broader range of, or access to, services and cost savings through\neconomies of scale, are similar to those for business combinations among other entities. The Board noted a\npossible alternative to the acquisition method in AASB 3 for business combinations among not-for-profit\nentities might be the \u2018fresh start\u2019 method, especially where it is difficult to identify the acquirer. The fresh\nstart method assumes that none of the combining entities survives the business combination as an\nindependent reporting entity. Rather, the business combination is viewed as a transfer of the net assets of\nthe combining entities to a new entity that assumes control over them. The Board noted the potential\nsignificant costs and practical difficulties that a fresh start alternative would impose, and therefore\nconcluded that the potential advantages of using the fresh start method for some business combinations\namong not-for-profit entities would be outweighed by the disadvantages.  \nBC6 However, the Board noted that the accounting for business combinations may differ depending on whether\nentities, such as local governments or universities, are commonly controlled. In that regard, the Board\nconfirmed that further work should be undertaken on its longer-term \u2018control in the public sector\u2019 project,\nwhich should include consideration of whether local governments or universities within a jurisdiction are\nsubject to common control.  \nBC7 In the interim, the Board decided to maintain the status quo in respect of accounting for restructures of local\ngovernments by substantially incorporating the requirements originally transferred from AAS 27 _Financial_\n_Reporting by Local Governments to superseded AASB 3 (as amended in December 2007 by AASB 2007-9_\n_Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Review of AASs 27, 29 and 31) into_  \n-----  revised AASB 3 (March 2008, as amended). The Board noted that the relief carried forward from AAS 27\nmight be impacted by the progress it makes on its \u2018control in the public sector\u2019 project.  \nBC8 The Board noted that this approach to restructures of local governments, consistent with its general\napproach to the short-term review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, is pragmatic and a consequence of the past\nrequirements in AAS 27.  \nBC9 The Board also considered the amendments made by the New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards Board\nto revised NZ IFRS 3 Business Combinations (March 2008) in the context of business combinations among\nnot-for-profit entities, including definitions of public benefit entities, business and equity interests. In\nmaking its decision, the Board considered the work undertaken to date on Invitation to Comment ITC 14\n_Not-for-Profit Entity Definition and Guidance, which sought input on using the definition and guidance_\nfrom NZ IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements in Australia. The Board suspended further work on_\nITC 14 until the development of guidelines that can be used for modifying IFRSs for application by not-forprofit entities. In light of this, the Board decided that no further changes should be made to AASB 3 (March\n2008, as amended) in respect of not-for-profit entities.  \n-----  ",
