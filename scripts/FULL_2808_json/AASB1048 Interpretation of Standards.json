These are to be applied by:  \n(a) entities required by the Corporations Act 2001 to prepare financial reports;  \n(b) governments in preparing financial statements for the whole of government and the General Government Sector\n(GGS); and  \n(c) entities in the private or public for-profit or not-for-profit sectors that are reporting entities or that prepare\ngeneral purpose financial statements.  \nAASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards establishes a differential reporting framework\nconsisting of two tiers of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements:  \n(a) Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and  \n(b) depending on the reporting period, either of the following:  \n(i) Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (for reporting periods\nbeginning before 1 July 2021);  \n(ii) Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Simplified Disclosures (for reporting periods beginning on or\nafter 1 July 2021, with earlier adoption permitted).",

Entities are required to apply\neach relevant Australian Interpretation in preparing financial statements that are within the scope of the Standard.  \nIn respect of the first group (Table 1), it is necessary for those Australian Interpretations, where relevant, to be applied\nin order for an entity to be able to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards). The IASB defines IFRS Standards to include both IFRIC and SIC\nInterpretations.  \nIn the second group (Table 2), this Standard lists the other Australian Interpretations, which do not correspond to the\nIASB Interpretations, to assist financial statement preparers and users to identify the other authoritative\npronouncements necessary for compliance in the Australian context.  \nThis Standard (see Table 3) also updates references to conceptual framework pronouncements in other Standards to\nrefer to amended versions of the pronouncements, as identified in this Standard.  \nThe Standard will be reissued or amended when necessary to keep the Tables up to date.",

A\nsimple reference to an Australian Interpretation in a Standard can refer only to the Interpretation that existed when the\nStandard was issued. It cannot refer to any revised version of the Interpretation that may exist at a later reporting date.\nHowever, a Standard can refer to a second Standard and, when the first Standard is applied at a later reporting date,\nthe reference will be to the then-current version of the second Standard, even if it has been reissued since the first\nStandard was issued.  \nThe service Standard approach, as applied to Australian Interpretations, involves issuing this Standard to list the\nversions of Australian Interpretations, and referring to this Standard in every other Standard where necessary to refer\nto an Interpretation. This enables references to the Interpretations in all other Standards to be updated by reissuing the\nservice Standard.  \nThis approach preserves the status of Australian Interpretations as \u2018external documents\u2019 referred to in a Standard. It\ndoes not treat the Interpretations as delegated legislation or confer ambulatory status on the reference. In each\nStandard where there is a need to refer to an Australian Interpretation, the reference will be to this Standard, phrased\nas \u201cInterpretation [number] [title] as identified in AASB 1048\u201d (or similar). This reference, being to another\nStandard, is ambulatory and will refer to the version of this Standard that is in force from time to time. AASB 1048\nitself will contain the direct references to the external documents and will be reissued periodically.  \nThis approach to clarifying the status of Australian Interpretations ensures there is no difference between the status in\nthe hierarchy accorded to Interpretations in IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\ncompared with AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.",
