However, an entity may choose to\napply this Standard to insurance contracts that have as their primary purpose the provision of\nservices for a fixed fee in accordance with paragraph 8 of AASB 17;  \n(c) financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations within the scope of AASB 9\n_Financial Instruments, AASB 10_ _Consolidated Financial Statements, AASB 11_ _Joint_\n_Arrangements, AASB 127_ _Separate Financial Statements and AASB 128_ _Investments in_\n_Associates and Joint Ventures; and_  \n(d) non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to\ncustomers or potential customers. For example, this Standard would not apply to a contract\nbetween two oil companies that agree to an exchange of oil to fulfil demand from their customers\nin different specified locations on a timely basis.  \nAus5.1 In addition to paragraph 5, in respect of not-for-profit entities, a transfer of a financial asset to\nenable an entity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset that is to be controlled\nby the entity, as described in AASB 1058 _Income of Not-for-Profit Entities, is not within the_\nscope of this Standard.  \n-----  Aus5.2 Notwithstanding paragraph 5, in respect of not-for-profit public sector licensors, this Standard\nalso applies to licences issued, other than licences subject to AASB 16 _Leases, or transactions_\nsubject to AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors, irrespective of whether the\nlicences are contracts with customers. Licences include those arising from statutory requirements.\nGuidance on applying this Standard to licences is set out in Appendix G, including the distinction\nbetween a licence and a tax.  \nAus5.3 Further to paragraph 5, public sector entities shall not apply this Standard to insurance contracts\nwithin the scope of AASB 4 Insurance Contracts.  \n6 An entity shall apply this Standard to a contract (other than a contract listed in paragraph 5) only if the\ncounterparty to the contract is a customer. A customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain\ngoods or services that are an output of the entity\u2019s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. A\ncounterparty to the contract would not be a customer if, for example, the counterparty has contracted with\nthe entity to participate in an activity or process in which the parties to the contract share in the risks and\nbenefits that result from the activity or process (such as developing an asset in a collaboration arrangement)\nrather than to obtain the output of the entity\u2019s ordinary activities.  \n7 A contract with a customer may be partially within the scope of this Standard and partially within the scope\nof other Standards listed in paragraph 5.  \n(a) If the other Standards specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the\ncontract, then an entity shall first apply the separation and/or measurement requirements in those\nStandards. An entity shall exclude from the transaction price the amount of the part (or parts) of\nthe contract that are initially measured in accordance with other Standards and shall apply\nparagraphs 73\u201386 to allocate the amount of the transaction price that remains (if any) to each\nperformance obligation within the scope of this Standard and to any other parts of the contract\nidentified by paragraph 7(b).  \n(b) If the other Standards do not specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of\nthe contract, then the entity shall apply this Standard to separate and/or initially measure the part\n(or parts) of the contract.  \nAus7.1 For not-for-profit entities, a contract may also be partially within the scope of this Standard and\npartially within the scope of AASB 1058.  \n8 This Standard specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and\nfor the costs incurred to fulfil a contract with a customer if those costs are not within the scope of another\nStandard (see paragraphs 91\u2013104). An entity shall apply those paragraphs only to the costs incurred that\nrelate to a contract with a customer (or part of that contract) that is within the scope of this Standard.",

In evaluating**\n**whether collectability of an amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider**\n**only the customer\u2019s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due.**\n**The amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled may be less than the price**\n**stated in the contract if the consideration is variable because the entity may offer the**\n**customer a price concession (see paragraph 52).**  \nAus9.1 Notwithstanding paragraph 9, in respect of not-for-profit entities, if a contract that would\notherwise be within the scope of AASB 15 does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9 as it is\nunenforceable or not sufficiently specific, it is not a contract with a customer within the scope of\nAASB 15 (see paragraph F5). An entity shall consider the requirements of AASB 1058 in\naccounting for such contracts.  \n10 A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations.\nEnforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law. Contracts can be written, oral or\nimplied by an entity\u2019s customary business practices. The practices and processes for establishing contracts\nwith customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an\nentity (for example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or\nservices). An entity shall consider those practices and processes in determining whether and when an\nagreement with a customer creates enforceable rights and obligations.  \n11 Some contracts with customers may have no fixed duration and can be terminated or modified by either\nparty at any time. Other contracts may automatically renew on a periodic basis that is specified in the\ncontract. An entity shall apply this Standard to the duration of the contract (ie the contractual period) in\nwhich the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations.  \n12 For the purpose of applying this Standard, a contract does not exist if each party to the contract has the\nunilateral enforceable right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other\nparty (or parties). A contract is wholly unperformed if both of the following criteria are met:  \n(a) the entity has not yet transferred any promised goods or services to the customer; and  \n(b) the entity has not yet received, and is not yet entitled to receive, any consideration in exchange\nfor promised goods or services.  \n13 If a contract with a customer meets the criteria in paragraph 9 at contract inception, an entity shall not\nreassess those criteria unless there is an indication of a significant change in facts and circumstances. For\nexample, if a customer\u2019s ability to pay the consideration deteriorates significantly, an entity would reassess\nwhether it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in\nexchange for the remaining goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.  \n14 If a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9, an entity shall continue to assess the\ncontract to determine whether the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met.  \n15 When a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9 and an entity receives\nconsideration from the customer, the entity shall recognise the consideration received as revenue only when\neither of the following events has occurred:  \n-----  (a) the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and all, or\nsubstantially all, of the consideration promised by the customer has been received by the entity\nand is non-refundable; or  \n(b) the contract has been terminated and the consideration received from the customer is nonrefundable.  \n16 An entity shall recognise the consideration received from a customer as a liability until one of the events in\nparagraph 15 occurs or until the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met (see paragraph 14). Depending\non the facts and circumstances relating to the contract, the liability recognised represents the entity\u2019s\nobligation to either transfer goods or services in the future or refund the consideration received. In either\ncase, the liability shall be measured at the amount of consideration received from the customer.",

        "page_content=": "## Contract modifications  \n18 A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that is approved by the\nparties to the contract. In some industries and jurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a\nchange order, a variation or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties to a contract\napprove a modification that either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the\nparties to the contract. A contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied\nby customary business practices. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification, an\nentity shall continue to apply this Standard to the existing contract until the contract modification is\napproved.  \n19 A contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or\nprice (or both) of the modification or the parties have approved a change in the scope of the contract but\nhave not yet determined the corresponding change in price. In determining whether the rights and\nobligations that are created or changed by a modification are enforceable, an entity shall consider all\nrelevant facts and circumstances including the terms of the contract and other evidence. If the parties to a\ncontract have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding\nchange in price, an entity shall estimate the change to the transaction price arising from the modification in\naccordance with paragraphs 50\u201354 on estimating variable consideration and paragraphs 56\u201358 on\nconstraining estimates of variable consideration.  \n20 An entity shall account for a contract modification as a separate contract if both of the following conditions\nare present:  \n(a) the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised goods or services that are\ndistinct (in accordance with paragraphs 26\u201330); and  \n(b) the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity\u2019s _stand-_\n_alone selling prices of the additional promised goods or services and any appropriate adjustments_\nto that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract. For example, an entity may\nadjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or service for a discount that the\ncustomer receives, because it is not necessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it\nwould incur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer.  \n21 If a contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in accordance with paragraph 20, an\nentity shall account for the promised goods or services not yet transferred at the date of the contract\nmodification (ie the remaining promised goods or services) in whichever of the following ways is\napplicable:  \n(a) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a termination of the existing\ncontract and the creation of a new contract, if the remaining goods or services are distinct from\nthe goods or services transferred on or before the date of the contract modification. The amount  \n-----  of consideration to be allocated to the remaining performance obligations (or to the remaining\ndistinct goods or services in a single performance obligation identified in accordance with\nparagraph 22(b)) is the sum of:  \n(i) the consideration promised by the customer (including amounts already received from\nthe customer) that was included in the estimate of the transaction price and that had not\nbeen recognised as revenue; and  \n(ii) the consideration promised as part of the contract modification.  \n(b) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a part of the existing contract if\nthe remaining goods or services are not distinct and, therefore, form part of a single performance\nobligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. The effect that the\ncontract modification has on the transaction price, and on the entity\u2019s measure of progress\ntowards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognised as an adjustment to\nrevenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) at the date of the contract modification\n(ie the adjustment to revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis).  \n(c) If the remaining goods or services are a combination of items (a) and (b), then the entity shall\naccount for the effects of the modification on the unsatisfied (including partially unsatisfied)\nperformance obligations in the modified contract in a manner that is consistent with the objectives\nof this paragraph.",

This is because a contract\nwith a customer may also include promises that are implied by an entity\u2019s customary business practices,\npublished policies or specific statements if, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a\nvalid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer.  \n25 Performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless\nthose activities transfer a good or service to a customer.

For some goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from a good or\nservice on its own. For other goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from the good or service\nonly in conjunction with other readily available resources. A readily available resource is a good or service\nthat is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource that the customer has already obtained\nfrom the entity (including goods or services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer\nunder the contract) or from other transactions or events. Various factors may provide evidence that the\ncustomer can benefit from a good or service either on its own or in conjunction with other readily available\nresources. For example, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately would indicate\nthat a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources.  \n29 In assessing whether an entity\u2019s promises to transfer goods or services to the customer are separately\nidentifiable in accordance with paragraph 27(b), the objective is to determine whether the nature of the\npromise, within the context of the contract, is to transfer each of those goods or services individually or,\ninstead, to transfer a combined item or items to which the promised goods or services are inputs. Factors\nthat indicate that two or more promises to transfer goods or services to a customer are not separately\nidentifiable include, but are not limited to, the following:  \n(a) the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or\nservices promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined\noutput or outputs for which the customer has contracted. In other words, the entity is using the\ngoods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the combined output or outputs specified by the\ncustomer. A combined output or outputs might include more than one phase, element or unit.  \n(b) one or more of the goods or services significantly modifies or customises, or are significantly\nmodified or customised by, one or more of the other goods or services promised in the contract.  \n(c) the goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated. In other words, each of the\ngoods or services is significantly affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the\ncontract. For example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly affected by\neach other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the\ngoods or services independently.  \n30 If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity shall combine that good or service with other\npromised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct. In some cases,\nthat would result in the entity accounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract as a single\nperformance obligation.  \n-----  ",

To determine the point in time at which a customer\nobtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity shall\nconsider the requirements for control in paragraphs 31\u201334. In addition, an entity shall consider indicators of\nthe transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:  \n(a) The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\u2014if a customer is presently obliged to pay\nfor an asset, then that may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of,\nand obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset in exchange.  \n(b) The customer has legal title to the asset\u2014legal title may indicate which party to a contract has the\nability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset or\nto restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. Therefore, the transfer of legal title of an\nasset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset. If an entity retains legal\ntitle solely as protection against the customer\u2019s failure to pay, those rights of the entity would not\npreclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset.  \n(c) The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\u2014the customer\u2019s physical possession of\nan asset may indicate that the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially\nall of the remaining benefits from, the asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those\nbenefits. However, physical possession may not coincide with control of an asset. For example, in\nsome repurchase agreements and in some consignment arrangements, a customer or consignee\nmay have physical possession of an asset that the entity controls. Conversely, in some bill-andhold arrangements, the entity may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls.\nParagraphs B64\u2013B76, B77\u2013B78 and B79\u2013B82 provide guidance on accounting for repurchase\nagreements, consignment arrangements and bill-and-hold arrangements, respectively.  \n(d) The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\u2014the transfer of the\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the customer may indicate that the\ncustomer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining\nbenefits from, the asset. However, when evaluating the risks and rewards of ownership of a\npromised asset, an entity shall exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance\nobligation in addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset. For example, an entity\nmay have transferred control of an asset to a customer but not yet satisfied an additional\nperformance obligation to provide maintenance services related to the transferred asset.  \n(e) The customer has accepted the asset\u2014the customer\u2019s acceptance of an asset may indicate that it\nhas obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits\nfrom, the asset. To evaluate the effect of a contractual customer acceptance clause on when\ncontrol of an asset is transferred, an entity shall consider the guidance in paragraphs B83\u2013B86.  \n**Measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance**\n**obligation**  \n39 For each performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35\u201337, an entity shall\nrecognise revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance\nobligation. The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity\u2019s performance in transferring\ncontrol of goods or services promised to a customer (ie the satisfaction of an entity\u2019s performance\nobligation).  \n40 An entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over\ntime and the entity shall apply that method consistently to similar performance obligations and in similar\ncircumstances. At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete\nsatisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time.  \n_Methods for measuring progress_  \n41 Appropriate methods of measuring progress include output methods and input methods. Paragraphs B14\u2013\nB19 provide guidance for using output methods and input methods to measure an entity\u2019s progress towards\ncomplete satisfaction of a performance obligation. In determining the appropriate method for measuring\nprogress, an entity shall consider the nature of the good or service that the entity promised to transfer to the\ncustomer.  \n-----  42 When applying a method for measuring progress, an entity shall exclude from the measure of progress any\ngoods or services for which the entity does not transfer control to a customer. Conversely, an entity shall\ninclude in the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does transfer control to a\ncustomer when satisfying that performance obligation.  \n43 As circumstances change over time, an entity shall update its measure of progress to reflect any changes in\nthe outcome of the performance obligation. Such changes to an entity\u2019s measure of progress shall be\naccounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with AASB 108 _Accounting Policies,_\n_Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._  \n_Reasonable measures of progress_  \n44 An entity shall recognise revenue for a performance obligation satisfied over time only if the entity can\nreasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. An entity\nwould not be able to reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance\nobligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required to apply an appropriate method of\nmeasuring progress.  \n45 In some circumstances (for example, in the early stages of a contract), an entity may not be able to\nreasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation, but the entity expects to recover the costs\nincurred in satisfying the performance obligation. In those circumstances, the entity shall recognise revenue\nonly to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that it can reasonably measure the outcome of the\nperformance obligation.",

The promised consideration can also vary\nif an entity\u2019s entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future\nevent. For example, an amount of consideration would be variable if either a product was sold with a right\nof return or a fixed amount is promised as a performance bonus on achievement of a specified milestone.  \n-----  52 The variability relating to the consideration promised by a customer may be explicitly stated in the contract.\nIn addition to the terms of the contract, the promised consideration is variable if either of the following\ncircumstances exists:  \n(a) the customer has a valid expectation arising from an entity\u2019s customary business practices,\npublished policies or specific statements that the entity will accept an amount of consideration\nthat is less than the price stated in the contract. That is, it is expected that the entity will offer a\nprice concession. Depending on the jurisdiction, industry or customer this offer may be referred\nto as a discount, rebate, refund or credit.  \n(b) other facts and circumstances indicate that the entity\u2019s intention, when entering into the contract\nwith the customer, is to offer a price concession to the customer.  \n53 An entity shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using either of the following methods,\ndepending on which method the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will\nbe entitled:  \n(a) The expected value\u2014the expected value is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of\npossible consideration amounts. An expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount\nof variable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.  \n(b) The most likely amount\u2014the most likely amount is the single most likely amount in a range of\npossible consideration amounts (ie the single most likely outcome of the contract). The most\nlikely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the\ncontract has only two possible outcomes (for example, an entity either achieves a performance\nbonus or does not).  \n54 An entity shall apply one method consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an\nuncertainty on an amount of variable consideration to which the entity will be entitled. In addition, an entity\nshall consider all the information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available to the entity\nand shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The information that an entity\nuses to estimate the amount of variable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the\nentity\u2019s management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in establishing prices for promised\ngoods or services.  \n_Refund liabilities_  \n55 An entity shall recognise a refund liability if the entity receives consideration from a customer and expects\nto refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of\nconsideration received (or receivable) for which the entity does not expect to be entitled (ie amounts not\nincluded in the transaction price). The refund liability (and corresponding change in the transaction price\nand, therefore, the _contract liability) shall be updated at the end of each reporting period for changes in_\ncircumstances. To account for a refund liability relating to a sale with a right of return, an entity shall apply\nthe guidance in paragraphs B20\u2013B27.  \n_Constraining estimates of variable consideration_  \n56 An entity shall include in the transaction price some or all of an amount of variable consideration estimated\nin accordance with paragraph 53 only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the\namount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\nconsideration is subsequently resolved.  \n57 In assessing whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue\nrecognised will not occur once the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is subsequently resolved,\nan entity shall consider both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal. Factors that could\nincrease the likelihood or the magnitude of a revenue reversal include, but are not limited to, any of the\nfollowing:  \n(a) the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity\u2019s influence. Those\nfactors may include volatility in a market, the judgement or actions of third parties, weather\nconditions and a high risk of obsolescence of the promised good or service.  \n(b) the uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period\nof time.  \n(c) the entity\u2019s experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that\nexperience (or other evidence) has limited predictive value.  \n-----  (d) the entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the\npayment terms and conditions of similar contracts in similar circumstances.  \n(e) the contract has a large number and broad range of possible consideration amounts.  \n58 An entity shall apply paragraph B63 to account for consideration in the form of a sales-based or usagebased royalty that is promised in exchange for a licence of intellectual property.  \n_Reassessment of variable consideration_  \n59 At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the estimated transaction price (including\nupdating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent\nfaithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances\nduring the reporting period. The entity shall account for changes in the transaction price in accordance with\nparagraphs 87\u201390.",

        "page_content=": "### The existence of a significant financing component in the contract\n60 In determining the transaction price, an entity shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the\neffects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either\nexplicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the\ntransfer of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant\nfinancing component. A significant financing component may exist regardless of whether the promise of\nfinancing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms agreed to by the parties to the\ncontract.  \n61 The objective when adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a significant financing component\nis for an entity to recognise revenue at an amount that reflects the price that a customer would have paid for\nthe promised goods or services if the customer had paid cash for those goods or services when (or as) they\ntransfer to the customer (ie the cash selling price). An entity shall consider all relevant facts and\ncircumstances in assessing whether a contract contains a financing component and whether that financing\ncomponent is significant to the contract, including both of the following:  \n(a) the difference, if any, between the amount of promised consideration and the cash selling price of\nthe promised goods or services; and  \n(b) the combined effect of both of the following:  \n(i) the expected length of time between when the entity transfers the promised goods or\nservices to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services; and  \n(ii) the prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.  \n62 Notwithstanding the assessment in paragraph 61, a contract with a customer would not have a significant\nfinancing component if any of the following factors exist:  \n(a) the customer paid for the goods or services in advance and the timing of the transfer of those\ngoods or services is at the discretion of the customer.  \n(b) a substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer is variable and the amount or\ntiming of that consideration varies on the basis of the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future\nevent that is not substantially within the control of the customer or the entity (for example, if the\nconsideration is a sales-based royalty).  \n(c) the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or\nservice (as described in paragraph 61) arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to\neither the customer or the entity, and the difference between those amounts is proportional to the\nreason for the difference. For example, the payment terms might provide the entity or the\ncustomer with protection from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its\nobligations under the contract.  \n63 As a practical expedient, an entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a\nsignificant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when\nthe entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or\nservice will be one year or less.  \n64 To meet the objective in paragraph 61 when adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a\nsignificant financing component, an entity shall use the discount rate that would be reflected in a separate\nfinancing transaction between the entity and its customer at contract inception. That rate would reflect the\ncredit characteristics of the party receiving financing in the contract, as well as any collateral or security  \n-----  provided by the customer or the entity, including assets transferred in the contract. An entity may be able to\ndetermine that rate by identifying the rate that discounts the nominal amount of the promised consideration\nto the price that the customer would pay in cash for the goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the\ncustomer. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the discount rate for changes in interest rates\nor other circumstances (such as a change in the assessment of the customer\u2019s credit risk).  \n65 An entity shall present the effects of financing (interest revenue or interest expense) separately from\nrevenue from contracts with customers in the statement of comprehensive income. Interest revenue or\ninterest expense is recognised only to the extent that a contract asset (or receivable) or a contract liability is\nrecognised in accounting for a contract with a customer.",

The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service\nwhen the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. A\ncontractually stated price or a list price for a good or service may be (but shall not be presumed to be) the\nstand-alone selling price of that good or service.  \n78 If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate the stand-alone selling price\nat an amount that would result in the allocation of the transaction price meeting the allocation objective in\nparagraph 73. When estimating a stand-alone selling price, an entity shall consider all information\n(including market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of\ncustomer) that is reasonably available to the entity. In doing so, an entity shall maximise the use of\nobservable inputs and apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.  \n79 Suitable methods for estimating the stand-alone selling price of a good or service include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:  \n(a) Adjusted market assessment approach\u2014an entity could evaluate the market in which it sells\ngoods or services and estimate the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay for\nthose goods or services. That approach might also include referring to prices from the entity\u2019s\ncompetitors for similar goods or services and adjusting those prices as necessary to reflect the\nentity\u2019s costs and margins.  \n(b) Expected cost plus a margin approach\u2014an entity could forecast its expected costs of satisfying a\nperformance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that good or service.  \n(c) Residual approach\u2014an entity may estimate the stand-alone selling price by reference to the total\ntransaction price less the sum of the observable stand-alone selling prices of other goods or\nservices promised in the contract. However, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate, in\naccordance with paragraph 78, the stand-alone selling price of a good or service only if one of the\nfollowing criteria is met:  \n(i) the entity sells the same good or service to different customers (at or near the same\ntime) for a broad range of amounts (ie the selling price is highly variable because a\nrepresentative stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or\nother observable evidence); or  \n(ii) the entity has not yet established a price for that good or service and the good or service\nhas not previously been sold on a stand-alone basis (ie the selling price is uncertain).  \n80 A combination of methods may need to be used to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the goods or\nservices promised in the contract if two or more of those goods or services have highly variable or uncertain\nstand-alone selling prices. For example, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate the aggregate\nstand-alone selling price for those promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone\nselling prices and then use another method to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the individual goods\nor services relative to that estimated aggregate stand-alone selling price determined by the residual\napproach. When an entity uses a combination of methods to estimate the stand-alone selling price of each\npromised good or service in the contract, the entity shall evaluate whether allocating the transaction price at\nthose estimated stand-alone selling prices would be consistent with the allocation objective in paragraph 73\nand the requirements for estimating stand-alone selling prices in paragraph 78.  \n-----  ",

The increased carrying amount of the asset shall not exceed the amount that would have been\ndetermined (net of amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised previously.",

A\ncontract liability is an entity\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has\nreceived consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.  \n107 If an entity performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration\nor before payment is due, the entity shall present the contract as a contract asset, excluding any amounts\npresented as a receivable.

Examples include routine or recurring services (such as a cleaning service)\nin which the receipt and simultaneous consumption by the customer of the benefits of the entity\u2019s\nperformance can be readily identified.  \nB4 For other types of performance obligations, an entity may not be able to readily identify whether a customer\nsimultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the entity\u2019s performance as the entity performs. In\nthose circumstances, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if an entity determines that another\nentity would not need to substantially re-perform the work that the entity has completed to date if that other\nentity were to fulfil the remaining performance obligation to the customer. In determining whether another\nentity would not need to substantially re-perform the work the entity has completed to date, an entity shall\nmake both of the following assumptions:  \n(a) disregard potential contractual restrictions or practical limitations that otherwise would prevent\nthe entity from transferring the remaining performance obligation to another entity; and  \n-----  (b) presume that another entity fulfilling the remainder of the performance obligation would not have\nthe benefit of any asset that is presently controlled by the entity and that would remain controlled\nby the entity if the performance obligation were to transfer to another entity.",

The asset\nthat is being created or enhanced (for example, a work-in-progress asset) could be either tangible or\nintangible.  \n**Entity\u2019s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use**\n**(paragraph 35(c))**  \nB6 In assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity in accordance with paragraph 36, an entity\nshall consider the effects of contractual restrictions and practical limitations on the entity\u2019s ability to readily\ndirect that asset for another use, such as selling it to a different customer. The possibility of the contract\nwith the customer being terminated is not a relevant consideration in assessing whether the entity would be\nable to readily direct the asset for another use.  \nB7 A contractual restriction on an entity\u2019s ability to direct an asset for another use must be substantive for the\nasset not to have an alternative use to the entity. A contractual restriction is substantive if a customer could\nenforce its rights to the promised asset if the entity sought to direct the asset for another use. In contrast, a\ncontractual restriction is not substantive if, for example, an asset is largely interchangeable with other assets\nthat the entity could transfer to another customer without breaching the contract and without incurring\nsignificant costs that otherwise would not have been incurred in relation to that contract.  \nB8 A practical limitation on an entity\u2019s ability to direct an asset for another use exists if an entity would incur\nsignificant economic losses to direct the asset for another use. A significant economic loss could arise\nbecause the entity either would incur significant costs to rework the asset or would only be able to sell the\nasset at a significant loss. For example, an entity may be practically limited from redirecting assets that\neither have design specifications that are unique to a customer or are located in remote areas.",

An amount that would compensate an entity for performance completed to\ndate would be an amount that approximates the selling price of the goods or services transferred to date (for\nexample, recovery of the costs incurred by an entity in satisfying the performance obligation plus a\nreasonable profit margin) rather than compensation for only the entity\u2019s potential loss of profit if the\ncontract were to be terminated. Compensation for a reasonable profit margin need not equal the profit\nmargin expected if the contract was fulfilled as promised, but an entity should be entitled to compensation\nfor either of the following amounts:  \n(a) a proportion of the expected profit margin in the contract that reasonably reflects the extent of the\nentity\u2019s performance under the contract before termination by the customer (or another party); or  \n(b) a reasonable return on the entity\u2019s cost of capital for similar contracts (or the entity\u2019s typical\noperating margin for similar contracts) if the contract-specific margin is higher than the return the\nentity usually generates from similar contracts.  \nB10 An entity\u2019s right to payment for performance completed to date need not be a present unconditional right to\npayment. In many cases, an entity will have an unconditional right to payment only at an agreed-upon\nmilestone or upon complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. In assessing whether it has a right to\npayment for performance completed to date, an entity shall consider whether it would have an enforceable\nright to demand or retain payment for performance completed to date if the contract were to be terminated\nbefore completion for reasons other than the entity\u2019s failure to perform as promised.  \nB11 In some contracts, a customer may have a right to terminate the contract only at specified times during the\nlife of the contract or the customer might not have any right to terminate the contract. If a customer acts to\nterminate a contract without having the right to terminate the contract at that time (including when a\ncustomer fails to perform its obligations as promised), the contract (or other laws) might entitle the entity to\ncontinue to transfer to the customer the goods or services promised in the contract and require the customer\nto pay the consideration promised in exchange for those goods or services. In those circumstances, an entity  \n-----  has a right to payment for performance completed to date because the entity has a right to continue to\nperform its obligations in accordance with the contract and to require the customer to perform its\nobligations (which include paying the promised consideration).  \nB12 In assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment for performance completed to date, an\nentity shall consider the contractual terms as well as any legislation or legal precedent that could\nsupplement or override those contractual terms. This would include an assessment of whether:  \n(a) legislation, administrative practice or legal precedent confers upon the entity a right to payment\nfor performance to date even though that right is not specified in the contract with the customer;  \n(b) relevant legal precedent indicates that similar rights to payment for performance completed to\ndate in similar contracts have no binding legal effect; or  \n(c) an entity\u2019s customary business practices of choosing not to enforce a right to payment has\nresulted in the right being rendered unenforceable in that legal environment. However,\nnotwithstanding that an entity may choose to waive its right to payment in similar contracts, an\nentity would continue to have a right to payment to date if, in the contract with the customer, its\nright to payment for performance to date remains enforceable.  \nB13 The payment schedule specified in a contract does not necessarily indicate whether an entity has an\nenforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Although the payment schedule in a\ncontract specifies the timing and amount of consideration that is payable by a customer, the payment\nschedule might not necessarily provide evidence of the entity\u2019s right to payment for performance completed\nto date. This is because, for example, the contract could specify that the consideration received from the\ncustomer is refundable for reasons other than the entity failing to perform as promised in the contract.",

If the entity\u2019s efforts or inputs are expended evenly throughout the performance period, it may\nbe appropriate for the entity to recognise revenue on a straight-line basis.  \nB19 A shortcoming of input methods is that there may not be a direct relationship between an entity\u2019s inputs and\nthe transfer of control of goods or services to a customer. Therefore, an entity shall exclude from an input\nmethod the effects of any inputs that, in accordance with the objective of measuring progress in\nparagraph 39, do not depict the entity\u2019s performance in transferring control of goods or services to the\ncustomer. For instance, when using a cost-based input method, an adjustment to the measure of progress\nmay be required in the following circumstances:  \n(a) When a cost incurred does not contribute to an entity\u2019s progress in satisfying the performance\nobligation. For example, an entity would not recognise revenue on the basis of costs incurred that\nare attributable to significant inefficiencies in the entity\u2019s performance that were not reflected in\nthe price of the contract (for example, the costs of unexpected amounts of wasted materials,\nlabour or other resources that were incurred to satisfy the performance obligation).  \n(b) When a cost incurred is not proportionate to the entity\u2019s progress in satisfying the performance\nobligation. In those circumstances, the best depiction of the entity\u2019s performance may be to adjust\nthe input method to recognise revenue only to the extent of that cost incurred. For example, a\nfaithful depiction of an entity\u2019s performance might be to recognise revenue at an amount equal to\nthe cost of a good used to satisfy a performance obligation if the entity expects at contract\ninception that all of the following conditions would be met:  \n(i) the good is not distinct;  \n(ii) the customer is expected to obtain control of the good significantly before receiving\nservices related to the good;  \n(iii) the cost of the transferred good is significant relative to the total expected costs to\ncompletely satisfy the performance obligation; and  \n(iv) the entity procures the good from a third party and is not significantly involved in\ndesigning and manufacturing the good (but the entity is acting as a principal in\naccordance with paragraphs B34\u2013B38).",

        "page_content=": "## Warranties  \nB28 It is common for an entity to provide (in accordance with the contract, the law or the entity\u2019s customary\nbusiness practices) a warranty in connection with the sale of a product (whether a good or service). The\nnature of a warranty can vary significantly across industries and contracts. Some warranties provide a\ncustomer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies\nwith agreed-upon specifications. Other warranties provide the customer with a service in addition to the\nassurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.  \nB29 If a customer has the option to purchase a warranty separately (for example, because the warranty is priced\nor negotiated separately), the warranty is a distinct service because the entity promises to provide the\nservice to the customer in addition to the product that has the functionality described in the contract. In\nthose circumstances, an entity shall account for the promised warranty as a performance obligation in\naccordance with paragraphs 22\u201330 and allocate a portion of the transaction price to that performance\nobligation in accordance with paragraphs 73\u201386.  \nB30 If a customer does not have the option to purchase a warranty separately, an entity shall account for the\nwarranty in accordance with AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets unless the\npromised warranty, or a part of the promised warranty, provides the customer with a service in addition to\nthe assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.  \nB31 In assessing whether a warranty provides a customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the\nproduct complies with agreed-upon specifications, an entity shall consider factors such as:  \n(a) Whether the warranty is required by law\u2014if the entity is required by law to provide a warranty,\nthe existence of that law indicates that the promised warranty is not a performance obligation\nbecause such requirements typically exist to protect customers from the risk of purchasing\ndefective products.  \n(b) The length of the warranty coverage period\u2014the longer the coverage period, the more likely it is\nthat the promised warranty is a performance obligation because it is more likely to provide a\nservice in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.  \n(c) The nature of the tasks that the entity promises to perform\u2014if it is necessary for an entity to\nperform specified tasks to provide the assurance that a product complies with agreed-upon\nspecifications (for example, a return shipping service for a defective product), then those tasks\nlikely do not give rise to a performance obligation.  \nB32 If a warranty, or a part of a warranty, provides a customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the\nproduct complies with agreed-upon specifications, the promised service is a performance obligation.\nTherefore, an entity shall allocate the transaction price to the product and the service. If an entity promises\nboth an assurance-type warranty and a service-type warranty but cannot reasonably account for them\nseparately, the entity shall account for both of the warranties together as a single performance obligation.  \nB33 A law that requires an entity to pay compensation if its products cause harm or damage does not give rise to\na performance obligation. For example, a manufacturer might sell products in a jurisdiction in which the\nlaw holds the manufacturer liable for any damages (for example, to personal property) that might be caused\nby a consumer using a product for its intended purpose. Similarly, an entity\u2019s promise to indemnify the\ncustomer for liabilities and damages arising from claims of patent, copyright, trademark or other\ninfringement by the entity\u2019s products does not give rise to a performance obligation. The entity shall\naccount for such obligations in accordance with AASB 137.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Principal versus agent considerations  \nB34 When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, the entity shall determine\nwhether the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods or services\nitself (ie the entity is a principal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided by the other party\n(ie the entity is an agent). An entity determines whether it is a principal or an agent for each specified good\nor service promised to the customer. A specified good or service is a distinct good or service (or a distinct\nbundle of goods or services) to be provided to the customer (see paragraphs 27\u201330). If a contract with a\ncustomer includes more than one specified good or service, an entity could be a principal for some specified\ngoods or services and an agent for others.  \nAusB34.1 Notwithstanding paragraphs B34\u2013B38, not-for-profit entities that are government departments\nshall apply the requirements of AASB 1050 Administered Items to administered items.  \nB34A To determine the nature of its promise (as described in paragraph B34), the entity shall:  \n(a) identify the specified goods or services to be provided to the customer (which, for example, could\nbe a right to a good or service to be provided by another party (see paragraph 26)); and  \n(b) assess whether it controls (as described in paragraph 33) each specified good or service before\nthat good or service is transferred to the customer.  \nB35 An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred\nto a customer. However, an entity does not necessarily control a specified good if the entity obtains legal\ntitle to that good only momentarily before legal title is transferred to a customer. An entity that is a principal\nmay satisfy its performance obligation to provide the specified good or service itself or it may engage\nanother party (for example, a subcontractor) to satisfy some or all of the performance obligation on its\nbehalf.  \nB35A When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity that is a principal\nobtains control of any one of the following:  \n(a) a good or another asset from the other party that it then transfers to the customer.  \n(b) a right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct\nthat party to provide the service to the customer on the entity\u2019s behalf.  \n(c) a good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in\nproviding the specified good or service to the customer. For example, if an entity provides a\nsignificant service of integrating goods or services (see paragraph 29(a)) provided by another\nparty into the specified good or service for which the customer has contracted, the entity controls\nthe specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. This is\nbecause the entity first obtains control of the inputs to the specified good or service (which\nincludes goods or services from other parties) and directs their use to create the combined output\nthat is the specified good or service.  \nB35B When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognises revenue in\nthe gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or\nservice transferred.  \nB36 An entity is an agent if the entity\u2019s performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified\ngood or service by another party. An entity that is an agent does not control the specified good or service\nprovided by another party before that good or service is transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity\nthat is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or\ncommission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services\nto be provided by the other party. An entity\u2019s fee or commission might be the net amount of consideration\nthat the entity retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for the goods or\nservices to be provided by that party.  \nB37 Indicators that an entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer (and is\ntherefore a principal (see paragraph B35)) include, but are not limited to, the following:  \n(a) the entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or\nservice. This typically includes responsibility for the acceptability of the specified good or service\n(for example, primary responsibility for the good or service meeting customer specifications). If\nthe entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or\nservice, this may indicate that the other party involved in providing the specified good or service\nis acting on the entity\u2019s behalf.  \n(b) the entity has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a\ncustomer or after transfer of control to the customer (for example, if the customer has a right of  \n-----  return). For example, if the entity obtains, or commits itself to obtain, the specified good or\nservice before obtaining a contract with a customer, that may indicate that the entity has the\nability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or\nservice before it is transferred to the customer.  \n(c) the entity has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. Establishing\nthe price that the customer pays for the specified good or service may indicate that the entity has\nthe ability to direct the use of that good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining\nbenefits. However, an agent can have discretion in establishing prices in some cases. For\nexample, an agent may have some flexibility in setting prices in order to generate additional\nrevenue from its service of arranging for goods or services to be provided by other parties to\ncustomers.  \nB37A The indicators in paragraph B37 may be more or less relevant to the assessment of control depending on the\nnature of the specified good or service and the terms and conditions of the contract. In addition, different\nindicators may provide more persuasive evidence in different contracts.  \nB38 If another entity assumes the entity\u2019s performance obligations and contractual rights in the contract so that\nthe entity is no longer obliged to satisfy the performance obligation to transfer the specified good or service\nto the customer (ie the entity is no longer acting as the principal), the entity shall not recognise revenue for\nthat performance obligation. Instead, the entity shall evaluate whether to recognise revenue for satisfying a\nperformance obligation to obtain a contract for the other party (ie whether the entity is acting as an agent).",

If the option provides a material right to the customer, the customer in\neffect pays the entity in advance for future goods or services and the entity recognises revenue when those\nfuture goods or services are transferred or when the option expires.  \nB41 If a customer has the option to acquire an additional good or service at a price that would reflect the standalone selling price for that good or service, that option does not provide the customer with a material right\neven if the option can be exercised only by entering into a previous contract.

In many cases, even though a non-refundable upfront fee relates to\nan activity that the entity is required to undertake at or near contract inception to fulfil the contract, that\nactivity does not result in the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer (see paragraph 25).\nInstead, the upfront fee is an advance payment for future goods or services and, therefore, would be\nrecognised as revenue when those future goods or services are provided. The revenue recognition period\nwould extend beyond the initial contractual period if the entity grants the customer the option to renew the\ncontract and that option provides the customer with a material right as described in paragraph B40.  \nB50 If the non-refundable upfront fee relates to a good or service, the entity shall evaluate whether to account\nfor the good or service as a separate performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22\u201330.  \nB51 An entity may charge a non-refundable fee in part as compensation for costs incurred in setting up a\ncontract (or other administrative tasks as described in paragraph 25).

Licences of intellectual\nproperty may include, but are not limited to, licences of any of the following:  \n(a) software and technology;  \n(b) motion pictures, music and other forms of media and entertainment;  \n(c) franchises; and  \n(d) patents, trademarks and copyrights.  \nB53 In addition to a promise to grant a licence (or licences) to a customer, an entity may also promise to transfer\nother goods or services to the customer. Those promises may be explicitly stated in the contract or implied\nby an entity\u2019s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements (see paragraph 24). As\nwith other types of contracts, when a contract with a customer includes a promise to grant a licence (or\nlicences) in addition to other promised goods or services, an entity applies paragraphs 22\u201330 to identify\neach of the performance obligations in the contract.  \nB54 If the promise to grant a licence is not distinct from other promised goods or services in the contract in\naccordance with paragraphs 26\u201330, an entity shall account for the promise to grant a licence and those other\npromised goods or services together as a single performance obligation.

In making this\ndetermination, an entity shall consider whether the nature of the entity\u2019s promise in granting the licence to a\ncustomer is to provide the customer with either:  \n(a) a right to access the entity\u2019s intellectual property as it exists throughout the licence period; or  \n(b) a right to use the entity\u2019s intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the licence\nis granted.",

Although not determinative, the existence of a shared economic interest (for\nexample, a sales-based royalty) between the entity and the customer related to the intellectual property to\nwhich the customer has rights may also indicate that the customer could reasonably expect that the entity\nwill undertake such activities.  \nB59A An entity\u2019s activities significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights when\neither:  \n(a) those activities are expected to significantly change the form (for example, the design or content)\nor the functionality (for example, the ability to perform a function or task) of the intellectual\nproperty; or  \n(b) the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property is substantially derived\nfrom, or dependent upon, those activities. For example, the benefit from a brand is often derived\nfrom, or dependent upon, the entity\u2019s ongoing activities that support or maintain the value of the\nintellectual property.  \nAccordingly, if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights has significant stand-alone\nfunctionality, a substantial portion of the benefit of that intellectual property is derived from that\nfunctionality. Consequently, the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from that intellectual property\nwould not be significantly affected by the entity\u2019s activities unless those activities significantly change its\nform or functionality. Types of intellectual property that often have significant stand-alone functionality\ninclude software, biological compounds or drug formulas, and completed media content (for example,\nfilms, television shows and music recordings).  \nB60 If the criteria in paragraph B58 are met, an entity shall account for the promise to grant a licence as a\nperformance obligation satisfied over time because the customer will simultaneously receive and consume\nthe benefit from the entity\u2019s performance of providing access to its intellectual property as the performance\noccurs (see paragraph 35(a)). An entity shall apply paragraphs 39\u201345 to select an appropriate method to\nmeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation to provide access.  \nB61 If the criteria in paragraph B58 are not met, the nature of an entity\u2019s promise is to provide a right to use the\nentity\u2019s intellectual property as that intellectual property exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the  \n-----  point in time at which the licence is granted to the customer. This means that the customer can direct the use\nof, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licence at the point in time at which the\nlicence transfers. An entity shall account for the promise to provide a right to use the entity\u2019s intellectual\nproperty as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time. An entity shall apply paragraph 38 to\ndetermine the point in time at which the licence transfers to the customer. However, revenue cannot be\nrecognised for a licence that provides a right to use the entity\u2019s intellectual property before the beginning of\nthe period during which the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence. For example, if a software\nlicence period begins before an entity provides (or otherwise makes available) to the customer a code that\nenables the customer to immediately use the software, the entity would not recognise revenue before that\ncode has been provided (or otherwise made available).  \nB62 An entity shall disregard the following factors when determining whether a licence provides a right to\naccess the entity\u2019s intellectual property or a right to use the entity\u2019s intellectual property:  \n(a) Restrictions of time, geographical region or use\u2014those restrictions define the attributes of the\npromised licence, rather than define whether the entity satisfies its performance obligation at a\npoint in time or over time.  \n(b) Guarantees provided by the entity that it has a valid patent to intellectual property and that it will\ndefend that patent from unauthorised use\u2014a promise to defend a patent right is not a performance\nobligation because the act of defending a patent protects the value of the entity\u2019s intellectual\nproperty assets and provides assurance to the customer that the licence transferred meets the\nspecifications of the licence promised in the contract.",

Customer acceptance clauses allow a customer to cancel a contract or require\nan entity to take remedial action if a good or service does not meet agreed-upon specifications. An entity\nshall consider such clauses when evaluating when a customer obtains control of a good or service.  \nB84 If an entity can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer\nin accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality\nthat would not affect the entity\u2019s determination of when the customer has obtained control of the good or\nservice.

An entity may also present this information for the current period or for\nearlier comparative periods, but is not required to do so.  \n-----  C5 An entity may use one or more of the following practical expedients when applying this Standard\nretrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3(a):  \n(a) for completed contracts, an entity need not restate contracts that:  \n(i) begin and end within the same annual reporting period; or  \n(ii) are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented.  \n(b) for completed contracts that have variable consideration, an entity may use the transaction price\nat the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in\nthe comparative reporting periods.  \n(c) for contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest period presented, an entity\nneed not retrospectively restate the contract for those contract modifications in accordance with\nparagraphs 20\u201321. Instead, an entity shall reflect the aggregate effect of all of the modifications\nthat occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when:  \n(i) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations;  \n(ii) determining the transaction price; and  \n(iii) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations.  \n(d) for all reporting periods presented before the date of initial application, an entity need not disclose\nthe amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations and an\nexplanation of when the entity expects to recognise that amount as revenue (see paragraph 120).  \nC6 For any of the practical expedients in paragraph C5 that an entity uses, the entity shall apply that expedient\nconsistently to all contracts within all reporting periods presented. In addition, the entity shall disclose all of\nthe following information:  \n(a) the expedients that have been used; and  \n(b) to the extent reasonably possible, a qualitative assessment of the estimated effect of applying each\nof those expedients.  \nC7 If an entity elects to apply this Standard retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3(b), the entity shall\nrecognise the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance\nof retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the annual reporting period that\nincludes the date of initial application. Under this transition method, an entity may elect to apply this\nStandard retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application\n(for example, 1 January 2018 for an entity with a 31 December year-end).  \nC7A An entity applying this Standard retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3(b) may also use the\npractical expedient described in paragraph C5(c), either:  \n(a) for all contract modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented; or  \n(b) for all contract modifications that occur before the date of initial application.  \nIf an entity uses this practical expedient, the entity shall apply the expedient consistently to all contracts and\ndisclose the information required by paragraph C6.  \nC8 For reporting periods that include the date of initial application, an entity shall provide both of the following\nadditional disclosures if this Standard is applied retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3(b):  \n(a) the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period\nby the application of this Standard as compared to AASB 111, AASB 118 and related\nInterpretations that were in effect before the change; and  \n(b) an explanation of the reasons for significant changes identified in C8(a).  \nC8A An entity shall apply AASB 2016-3 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Clarifications to_\n_AASB 15 (see paragraph C1B) retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108. In applying the amendments_\nretrospectively, an entity shall apply the amendments as if they had been included in AASB 15 at the date of\ninitial application. Consequently, an entity does not apply the amendments to reporting periods or to\ncontracts to which the requirements of AASB 15 are not applied in accordance with paragraphs C2\u2013C8. For\nexample, if an entity applies AASB 15 in accordance with paragraph C3(b) only to contracts that are not\ncompleted contracts at the date of initial application, the entity does not restate the completed contracts at\nthe date of initial application of AASB 15 for the effects of these amendments.  \n-----  ",

The AASB has prepared this appendix to explain and illustrate the principles in the Standard\nfrom the perspective of not-for-profit entities in the private and public sectors, particularly to address\ncircumstances where a for-profit perspective does not readily translate to a not-for-profit perspective. The\nappendix does not apply to for-profit entities or affect their application of AASB 15.  \nF2 AASB 15 provides guidance on the following five elements of a contract with a customer:  \n(a) identifying a contract (paragraphs 9\u201321);  \n(b) identifying performance obligations (paragraphs 22\u201330);  \n(c) determining the transaction price (paragraphs 46\u201372);  \n(d) allocating the transaction price to performance obligations (paragraphs 73\u201390); and  \n(e) recognising revenue (paragraphs 31\u201345).  \nF3 This appendix should be read in conjunction with the requirements of this Standard.  \nF4 This appendix provides guidance to assist not-for-profit entities to determine whether particular transactions\nor other events, or components thereof, are within the scope of this Standard, in particular in relation to\nidentifying a contract and identifying performance obligations. If a transaction is outside the scope of this\nStandard, the recognition and measurement of income arising from the transaction may instead be specified\nby another Standard, for example AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities.",

        "page_content=": "## Enforceable agreement  \nF10 An inherent feature of a contract with a customer is that the entity makes promises in an agreement that\ncreates enforceable rights and obligations. Paragraphs F11\u2013F18 provide guidance for not-for-profit entities\non when an agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.  \nF11 An agreement is enforceable when a separate party is able to enforce it through legal or equivalent means. It\nis not necessary for each promise in the agreement to transfer goods or services to be enforceable by legal or\nequivalent means, as long as some enforceable obligations of the entity arise from the agreement. For an\nagreement to be enforceable by a separate party through \u2018equivalent means\u2019, the presence of a mechanism\noutside the legal system that establishes the right of a separate party to oblige the entity to act in a particular\nway or be subject to consequence is required.  \nF12 An agreement typically is enforceable by another party through legal or equivalent means if the agreement is\nin writing and includes sufficiently specific requirements of the parties. Oral agreements also may be\nenforceable. Enforceability needs to be considered in relation to both the particular terms of an agreement\nand any additional terms agreed by the parties as a result of further discussions or actions. Examples of\nterms that result in enforceable agreements include the following:  \n(a) a refund in cash or kind is required when the agreed specific performance has not occurred;  \n(b) the customer, or another party acting on its behalf, has a right to enforce specific performance or\nclaim damages;  \n(c) the customer has the right to take a financial interest in assets purchased or constructed by the\nentity with resources provided under the agreement;  \n(d) the parties to the agreement are required to agree on alternative uses of the resources provided\nunder the agreement; and  \n(e) an administrative process exists to enforce agreements between sovereign States or between a\nState and another party.  \nF13 A sufficiently specific, written agreement can be enforceable even if the particular terms do not include\nrefund or other enforcement provisions, since Australian law generally provides remedies of specific\nperformance or damages for breach of an agreement. Agreements that explicitly state they are not intended\nto be legally binding may nonetheless become enforceable agreements if the parties act in a manner that is\ninconsistent with the stated intention. Agreements that lack elements of a contract may nonetheless become\nlegally enforceable if there is conduct by one party that causes the other party to act in reliance on such\nconduct. The enforceability of agreements does not depend on their form. For example, documents such as\nMemoranda of Understanding, Heads of Agreement and Letters of Intent can constitute legally enforceable\nagreements; a formal contract is not required.  \nF14 In respect of not-for-profit entities, enforcement mechanisms may arise from administrative arrangements or\nstatutory provisions. An example of such an enforcement mechanism is a directive given by a Minister or\ngovernment department to a public sector entity controlled by the government to which the Minister or\ngovernment department belongs. The ministerial authority to require a transfer of goods or services would\nbe sufficient for an agreement to be enforceable by a separate party through legal or equivalent means.  \nF15 In relation to paragraph F11, a consequence for failing to transfer promised goods or services could be either\na return of consideration or a penalty for non-performance that is sufficiently severe to compel the entity to\nfulfil its promise to transfer goods or services. In some circumstances, where rights to specific performance\nare unavailable or unnecessary, the authority to require compensation may be the key determinant of the\nenforceability of an agreement involving a promise to transfer goods or services. A capacity to impose a\nsevere penalty for non-performance can exist without a capacity to require a return of transferred assets or\nassets of equivalent value.  \n-----  F16 Identification of an agreement as being enforceable by another party through legal or equivalent means does\nnot require a history of enforcement of similar agreements by the customer or even an intention of the\ncustomer to enforce its rights. A customer might choose not to enforce its rights against an entity. However,\nthat decision is at the customer\u2019s discretion, and does not affect the enforceability of the customer\u2019s rights.\nEnforceability depends solely on the customer\u2019s capacity to enforce its rights.  \nF17 In contrast to the factors in paragraph F11, the following circumstances would not, of themselves, cause an\nagreement involving a promise to transfer goods or services to be enforceable by another party through legal\nor equivalent means:  \n(a) a transferor has the capacity to withhold future funding to which the entity is not presently\nentitled; and  \n(b) a not-for-profit entity publishes a statement of intent to spend money or consume assets in\nparticular ways. The statement of intent is generally in the nature of a public policy statement, and\ndoes not identify parties who could enforce the statement. Such a statement of intent would, of\nitself, be insufficient to create an enforceable agreement, even if that statement is the subject of\nbudget-to-actual reporting and of other oversight mechanisms to discharge accountability for the\nraising of funds, expenditure or consumption of assets. This is in contrast to a letter of intent\nwhich is typically an agreement between specifically identified parties. See also paragraph\nAus26.1 of AASB 137.  \nF18 In relation to paragraph F17(a), a transferor\u2019s capacity to withhold future funding to which the entity is not\npresently entitled can be distinguished from circumstances in which a transferor presently holds refund\nrights, or has the capacity to impose a severe penalty, in the event of the transferee\u2019s non-performance, but\nmight choose to obtain such a refund or impose such a penalty by deducting the amount of the refund or\npenalty from a future transfer to the entity. For example, a transferor\u2019s capacity to withhold future funding to\nwhich the transferee is not presently entitled would differ from circumstances in which a transferor could\ndemand a refund of granted assets in the event of the transferee\u2019s non-performance, regardless of whether it\nmakes any future transfers to the transferee, but chooses for convenience to deduct the refund amount from a\nfuture transfer. In this latter case, the transferor could enforce against the entity a promise to provide goods\nor services.",

A contract may have \u2018commercial substance\u2019, for the\npurposes of paragraph 9(d), even if it is entered into by a not-for-profit entity for purposes that, in everyday\nlanguage, would be considered \u2018non-commercial\u2019 (for example, contracts to provide goods or services to\nmembers of the community on a subsidised or cost-recovery basis).

        "page_content=": "## Identifying whether a performance obligation exists  \nF20 Paragraphs 22 and 30 of AASB 15 require that to enable an entity to identify the performance obligations\nthat it should account for separately, each promise to transfer goods or services needs to be distinct \u2013\nindividually, or if not individually, as a bundle combined with other promises. The specificity of the promise\nto transfer goods or services can be quite different in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. A necessary\ncondition for identifying a performance obligation of a not-for-profit entity is that the promise is sufficiently\nspecific to be able to determine when the obligation is satisfied. Judgement is necessary to assess whether a\npromise is sufficiently specific. Such judgement takes into account any conditions specified in the\narrangement, whether explicit or implicit, regarding the promised goods or services, including conditions\nregarding the following aspects:  \n(a) the nature or type of the goods or services;  \n(b) the cost or value of the goods or services;  \n(c) the quantity of the goods or services; and  \n(d) the period over which the goods or services must be transferred.  \n-----  F21 In the not-for-profit context, a service can include an arrangement whereby one entity undertakes specific\nactivities on behalf of another entity. Activities may include service delivery, research or asset management,\namong others. However, performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must undertake to\nfulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service to a customer. For example, research\nactivities undertaken to develop intellectual property that the entity will license to a customer are not\nthemselves a transfer of goods or services to the customer.  \nF22 Whether a promise is sufficiently specific so as to qualify as a performance obligation is assessed separately\nfor each promise and will depend on the facts and circumstances. No specific number or combination of the\nconditions noted in paragraph F20 need to be specified in an agreement for the promise to be sufficiently\nspecific. In addition, there may be other conditions that need to be taken into account in applying the\njudgement above that may indicate the promise is sufficiently specific.  \nF23 Conditions specified regarding the promised goods or services may be explicit or implicit in an agreement.\nParagraph 24 states that the performance obligations identified in a contract with a customer may not be\nlimited to the goods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract. This is because a contract with a\ncustomer may also include promises that are implied by an entity\u2019s customary business practices, published\npolicies or specific statements if, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a valid\nexpectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer. A not-for-profit\nentity may make a statement of intent to spend a transfer in a particular way. As noted in paragraph F17(b),\na statement of intent alone is generally not enough to create a performance obligation. Some element of the\ncontract will need to be enforceable and past practice would need to support the customer expectation.  \nF24 In relation to paragraph F20(d), a condition that a not-for-profit entity must transfer unspecified goods or\nservices within a particular period does not, of itself, meet the \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 criterion. For example,\na not-for-profit entity may provide a number of services under its charter such as counselling and housing to\ndisadvantaged youth. Where it receives a transfer to be used for an unspecified purpose over a particular\ntime period, such a promise would not meet the \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 criterion.  \nF25 Some not-for-profit entities have a single purpose charter, such as to provide counselling services. However,\nit is unlikely that an entity\u2019s charter or stated objectives would be specific enough to require the recognition\nof contract liabilities under a contract that provided the entity with a grant for a specified period of time but\ndid not also adequately identify the goods or services to be provided to other parties. Where entities receive\na transfer to be used over a particular time period for specified services, such a transfer could meet the\n\u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 criterion. Specifying the services to be provided under the arrangement and the\nstipulation to use the transferred funds over a particular time period enables a determination of when the\nservices have been provided. However, if the transfer does not specify the period over which the entity must\nuse the funds or the services to be provided (such as the number of counselling sessions), the entity would\nnot meet the \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 criterion because it would be unable to determine when it meets the\nperformance obligations.  \nF26 An agreement may include a condition that the entity undertakes an acquittal process to demonstrate\nprogress toward transferring goods or services. For example, the terms of an agreement may require the\nentity to report on progress toward specified outputs or outcomes in an acquittal process. Such an acquittal\nprocess may provide evidence of a promise to transfer goods or services that is sufficiently specific,\ndepending on the requirements of the acquittal process and other facts and circumstances. An acquittal\nprocess may also enable a determination of progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation.  \nF27 Where a contract provides a transfer of a financial asset for an entity to acquire or construct a non-financial\nasset (eg a building or an intangible asset) that is to be controlled by the entity, the contract does not\nestablish rights and obligations for the transfer of the non-financial asset to the transferor or other parties.\nAccordingly, the contract is not a contract with a customer, and hence is not accounted for in accordance\nwith AASB 15. Such contracts are instead accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 15\u201317 of\nAASB 1058. In this case, the transferor has made an in-substance transfer of the non-financial asset to the\nentity. The entity would retain control of the non-financial asset and use it in its operations, such as to\nproduce goods or services for transfer to other parties under other contracts. A contract to transfer a financial\nasset for an entity to acquire or construct a non-financial asset that is to be controlled by the entity may be\npart of a contract that includes other conditions that give rise to performance obligations that require the\nentity to transfer goods or services to other entities. Those performance obligations are accounted for under\nAASB 15.",

An entity shall allocate the transaction\nprice to each performance obligation so that the performance obligation allocation depicts the amount of  \n-----  consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or\nservices to the customer. This is based on the rebuttable presumption that the transaction price is treated as\nwholly related to the transfer of promised goods or services.  \nF29 The presumption is rebutted where the transaction price is partially refundable in the event the entity does\nnot deliver the promised goods or services.  \nF30 Where the presumption is rebutted, the entity shall disaggregate the transaction price and account for the\ncomponent that relates to the transfer of promised goods or services in accordance with this Standard. The\nremainder of the transaction price shall be accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058. Whether the\nelement not related to the performance obligation is material, and therefore needs to be accounted for\nseparately, shall be assessed in relation to the individual contract, without reassessment at an aggregate or\nportfolio level.  \nF31 To disaggregate the component that relates to the promised goods or services, the following may be\nindicative of an element that is not related to the promised goods or services (and more likely to be for the\npurpose of enabling the not-for-profit entity to further its objectives):  \n(a) a non-refundable component of the transaction price; and  \n(b) where the entity has the status of a deductible gift recipient \u2013 the donor can claim part of the\ntransaction price as a tax deduction for a donation.  \nF32 For example, a not-for-profit heritage foundation sells on-line subscriptions that provide access for a year to\nparticular heritage sites (a promised service to each customer) and invites subscribers to, in addition, donate\na non-refundable nominated amount to generally assist the foundation in pursuing its mission. Such a\ndonation, which is voluntary for a subscriber, is separately identifiable from the price of the annual\nsubscription. However, if the annual subscription fee and the donation were both refundable if access were\nnot provided for the entire subscription period, the presumption in paragraph F28 could not be rebutted as\nthe transaction price is refundable in full. In that case, the donation amount would not be accounted for\nseparately but would be included in the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation to\nprovide membership access. Consequently, the donation amount would be recognised as revenue when (or\nas) performance obligations under the arrangement are satisfied in accordance with AASB 15. Similarly, if\nboth elements were equally proportionately refundable to acknowledge access already provided during the\nyear, or if neither element were refundable, then no separation is required as the presumption is not rebutted.  \n-----  ",

These features are not\nan exhaustive list and not all features need to be present for an arrangement to be a licence:  \n|Feature|Licence|Tax|\n|---|---|---|\n|(a) Is the arrangement discretionary rather than compulsory for the payer?|Discretionary (eg payer \u2013 the licensee \u2013 has discretion over whether to perform an activity that requires permission and it is not compulsory if payment not made to retrospectively obtain the right, but subject to fines or other penalties)|Compulsory (eg non-discretionary payments for activities that are necessary for the entity to operate, for example earning revenue, and it is compulsory to pay the base amount in addition to penalty fees and interest)|\n|(b) What is the primary purpose?|Non-financial purpose (eg equitable allocation of a public resource)|Generating income for the public sector entity (eg very high proceeds in relation to the costs incurred might be indicative of a tax element)|\n|(c) Does the arrangement create direct rights to use or access an asset for the payer, or perform an activity, and, depending on the type of arrangement, direct obligations of the payee?|Creates direct rights for the payer (licensee), and could create direct obligations for the payee (licensor)|No specific rights for the payer or obligations for the payee|\n|(d) Does the arrangement give the payer specific permission that must be obtained prior to performing an activity or using or accessing a resource of the payee that would otherwise be unlawful?|Yes|No|\n|(e) Does the arrangement transfer control of the payee\u2019s underlying asset?|No|Not relevant|  \nG4 A not-for-profit public sector entity may enter into an arrangement with a dual purpose of issuing a licence\nand imposing a tax. Consistent with paragraph F28 of AASB 15, the rebuttable presumption is for the notfor-profit public sector licensor to allocate the transaction price wholly to the promise to issue a licence.  \nG5 The presumption is rebutted if one of the following criteria are satisfied:  \n(a) the transaction price is partially refundable in the event the entity does not issue the licence; or  \n1 AASB 1058 defines taxes as \u201cEconomic benefits compulsorily paid or payable to public sector entities in accordance with laws and/or\nregulations established to provide income to the government. Taxes exclude fines.\u201d  \n-----  (b) a similar activity effected through a different transaction or organisational structure is subject to a\ntax, providing evidence of the composite nature of the arrangement or there is other evidence\nsupporting that there is a tax not specific to the licencing arrangement.  \nG6 Where the presumption is rebutted the entity shall disaggregate the transaction price and account for the\ncomponent that relates to the licence in accordance with AASB 15. The remainder of the transaction price\nthat is determined to be a tax shall be accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058. Whether the element\nnot related to the licence is material, and therefore needs to be accounted for separately, shall be assessed in\nrelation to the individual arrangement, without reassessment at an aggregate or portfolio level.  \nG7 For example, a casino licence permits gaming activities to be conducted. Similar gaming activities are also\nconducted online by third parties who are not subject to a casino or any other kind of licence and are taxed at\na rate of 10 per cent of proceeds received. This provides evidence that the casino arrangement contains both\na licence and a tax and that the presumption in G4 should be rebutted. The tax rate charged to the third party\nprovides evidence of the amount that should be disaggregated as the tax component.",

        "page_content=": "## Non-contractual licences arising from statutory requirements  \nG8 The scope of AASB 15 is underpinned by the definition of a contract in Appendix A, which is an agreement\nbetween two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. When determining whether a\nlicence is a contract with a customer a not-for-profit public sector entity shall consider paragraphs F5\u2013F19 of\nAASB 15, also having regard to paragraphs G9 and G10.  \nG9 Enforceable rights and obligations between parties may arise from statutory requirements even though no\ncontractual relationship exists. For example, a not-for-profit public sector entity may enter into an agreement\nwith another entity without satisfying the formative elements required to establish a contract (such as the\nreciprocal intention to create legal relations). Similarly, where an involuntary payment is made to obtain a\nlicence, the arrangement may not be considered a contract under Australian law, despite being economically\nsimilar to a contractual relationship.  \nG10 Determining whether a licence issued by a not-for-profit public sector licensor is created by contract or by\nstatute alone may require significant analysis as to whether there is sufficient \u2018voluntariness\u2019 and\n\u2018reciprocity\u2019 to evidence an intention to create a contract, particularly where a voluntary decision to\nundertake an activity results in an involuntary fee. However, the requirements of AASB 15 focus on whether\nenforceable rights and obligations are present, and as noted in paragraph F13, the enforceability of\nagreements does not depend on their form. Accordingly, a licence issued by a not-for-profit public sector\nlicensor, with enforceable rights and obligations, would be within the scope of AASB 15 (subject to the\nother requirements of the Standard) regardless of whether it is considered under Australian law to have been\ncreated by contract or by statute.",

However, an entity shall also assess the arrangement\nto identify any other goods or services promised to the licensee.  \nG19 In accordance with paragraph 25, performance obligations do not include activities that a licensor must\nundertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service additional to the licence issued\nto the licensee. For example:  \n(a) a promise to the licensee that the right is restricted to the licensee is not a performance obligation.\nA promise in the licence terms that the licensor will not issue a similar right to another party (ie\nexclusivity to the licensee) is considered an attribute of the arrangement and does not transfer a\ngood or service additional to the licence. Although the licensor maintaining exclusivity maintains\nthe value of the licence, and has a greater value than a non-exclusive licence, it does not transfer\nan additional good or service. The licensor refraining from issuing another licence to a new\nlicensee only confirms the licence meets the attributes promised at inception of the licence.\nSimilarly, if a licensor carries out activities to ensure that no other party engages in the activities\nthat the licensee has an exclusive right to, this does not provide a service to the licensee, but\ninstead is an activity that confirms the licence meets the attributes promised at inception of the\nlicence;  \n(b) activities that a licensor is required to undertake in the context of a non-IP licence to benefit the\ngeneral public or to confirm the terms of the licence are being met (for example \u2018policing\u2019\nactivities to ensure licensee is not carrying out illegal activities or customers of the licensee are of\na legally allowable age) are not performance obligations.

This is\non the grounds that the research data is made public as it is collected.  \n-----  Accordingly, the institute recognises revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation.

Furthermore, the performance of the research activities results in the accumulation of knowledge,\nwhich is an asset (whether recognisable or unrecognisable) developed by the researcher but not immediately\nconsumed. Therefore, paragraph 35(a) is not satisfied.  \nAs the donor does not obtain the IP under the agreement, Institute C determines that its research does not\ncreate or enhance an asset that donor M controls as the asset is created or enhanced. Therefore, paragraph\n35(b) is not satisfied.  \nInstitute C notes that its research performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity\ndue to the restrictions in the agreement regarding directing the research to another use. Institute C also notes\nthat it has an explicit, enforceable right to payment for performance completed. Therefore, paragraph 35(c)\nis satisfied.  \nAccordingly, Institute C concludes that the performance obligation is satisfied over time and recognises\nrevenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation. The institute elects to measure progress on the\nbasis of the amount it would be entitled to receive for its performance to date, which corresponds with the\nvalue of the performance to the customer.  \n**Example 4C \u2013 Enforceable agreement, sufficiently specific performance obligation, research data and**\n**assessment only**  \nIn this example, the facts of Example 4B apply, except that Institute C is able to utilise the research it\nperforms for any other use of the institute. Institute C concludes that the arrangement is a contract with a\ncustomer as defined in AASB 15, on the same basis as set out in Example 4A.  \nAccounting treatment  \nIn accordance with AASB 15, Institute C allocates the cash grant to its identified performance obligation\nand recognises the financial asset (cash) and a contract liability of $5.3 million on initial recognition.  \nInstitute C concludes that the donor does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the\nresearch services as they are performed, on the same basis as set out in Example 4B. Therefore, paragraph\n35(a) is not satisfied.  \nInstitute C determines that its research does not create or enhance an asset that donor M controls as the asset\nis created or enhanced, on the same basis as set out in Example 4B. Therefore, paragraph 35(b) is not\nsatisfied.  \nMoreover, the institute notes that it is able to utilise the research it performs for any other use it determines.\nThis is on the grounds that the institute has no contractual or practical limitation on its use of the research,\nincluding having the ability to sell the research to another customer. Therefore, the institute\u2019s performance\ndoes create an asset with an alternative use to the entity, and paragraph 35(c) is not satisfied.  \n-----  Accordingly, Institute C concludes that the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time (the end of\nthe grant period) and recognises revenue at the conclusion of the agreement, when it satisfies the\nperformance obligation.  \n**Example 4D \u2013 Enforceable agreement, sufficiently specific performance obligation, research data**\n**only**  \nIn this example, the facts of Example 4C apply, except that, rather than requiring publication of research\ndata contemporaneously or at the conclusion of the research, the grant agreement refers to the institute\u2019s\npolicy that requires the de-identified research findings (including data) to be made available to the donor\nand authorised third parties periodically (eg at least annually at the end of each year).[a]  \nInstitute C concludes that the arrangement is a contract with a customer as defined in AASB 15 on the basis\nthat:  \nInstitute C\u2019s promise of specified research and making available the de-identified research findings is\nenforceable as the grant is refundable if the research is not undertaken; and  \nthe institute identifies its promises to make available de-identified research findings periodically as\nsufficiently specific promises as they are separate performance obligations each satisfied at a point in\ntime, representing discrete transfers of the research findings to the donor or third-party beneficiaries.\nThe promises are sufficiently specific on the basis that the policies attached to the research grant\nspecify the nature of the material (de-identified research findings (including data)) to be made available\nand a timeframe for that to occur (ie making the research findings available periodically, at least at the\nend of each of the three years). The terms of the grant require the institute to make the research\nfindings available to the donor and third parties as set out in its policy, regardless of whether the donor\nor third parties actually access the findings.  \nAccounting treatment  \nIn accordance with AASB 15, Institute C allocates the cash grant to its identified performance obligations\nand recognises the financial asset (cash) and a contract liability of $5.3 million on initial recognition.  \nInstitute C concludes that for each of the performance obligations, the donor does not simultaneously\nreceive and consume the benefits of the research services as they are performed. This is on the grounds that\nperformance of the research activities results in the accumulation of knowledge, an asset (whether\nrecognisable or unrecognisable) that is not immediately consumed. Therefore, paragraph 35(a) is not\nsatisfied.  \nThe donor does not obtain the IP under the agreement, nor does the donor control the knowledge\naccumulated as research activities are carried out. As a result, Institute C determines that its research does\nnot create or enhance an asset that the donor M controls as the asset is created or enhanced. Therefore,\nparagraph 35(b) is not satisfied.  \nMoreover, the institute notes that it is able to utilise the research it performs for any other use it determines.\nThis is on the grounds that the institute has no contractual or practical limitation on its use of the research,\nincluding having the ability to sell the research to another party. Therefore, the institute\u2019s performance does\ncreate an asset with an alternative use to the entity, and paragraph 35(c) is not satisfied.  \nAccordingly, Institute C concludes that each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time (eg the\nend of each year) when the research findings to date are made available, whether or not the donor or third\nparties access the findings, and recognises the related revenue at those points in time (eg the end of each\nyear).  \na Alternatively, where the grant agreement does not explicitly refer to the institute\u2019s policy, provided the donor is aware of\nthis policy, the institute\u2019s past practice of making de-identified research findings available at least annually to donors and\nauthorised third parties in accordance with its policy may create a valid expectation that the research findings will be made\navailable. In this case, the implicit promises to make available de-identified research findings periodically would be treated\nas part of the grant terms. [The grant agreement could instead refer explicitly to the making available of research findings,\nso that reference to a policy of the institute would not be necessary.]",

However, University G concludes its arrangement with donor Z is not a contract with a\ncustomer as defined in AASB 15. This is on the basis that:  \npublicising the research results when appropriate is not sufficiently specific to enable University A to\nidentify when it satisfies its obligations because there is no requirement to produce a specified number\nof publications or deliver a specified number of presentations; and  \nthe budget reports merely provide the grantor an indication of the University\u2019s spending of funds and\ndo not represent a transfer of a benefit to the grantor.  \nAccordingly, the university concludes that the arrangement is not within the scope of AASB 15. Given that\nthe university acquired cash (the grant funds) for consideration that is significantly less than fair value\n(there are no performance obligations to recognise) principally to enable it to further its objectives\n(research), University G concludes that AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities is applicable.  \nAccounting treatment  \nUniversity G recognises a financial asset of $2 million for the cash grant received and recognises any\nrelated amounts arising under other Australian Accounting Standards in accordance with AASB 1058. Any\nexcess of the financial asset over the related amounts would be recognised as income.  \n**Example 5B \u2013 Enforceable agreement, performance obligations not sufficiently specific, individual**\n**researcher controls grant funds**  \nIn this example, the facts of Example 5A apply, except that:  \nUniversity G receives the grant funds to administer on behalf of a researcher named in the grant;  \nthe named researcher may direct the use of the funds in accordance with the grant agreement; and  \nthe funding arrangement is tied to the researcher, so that if the researcher moves from University G to\nanother research institution, any unspent grant funds held by the university will be transferred to the\nother research institution.  \nUniversity G concludes that the arrangement is not a contract with a customer as defined in AASB 15, on\nthe same basis as set out in Example 5A.  \nUniversity G notes that it merely administers the grant funds on behalf of the researcher. Accordingly, the\nuniversity considers the arrangement under the requirements of AASB 9 Financial Instruments, noting it:  \nreceives cash that it administers in accordance with the grant agreement (to which it is a party);  \nmay invest the funds it holds as it considers appropriate, benefiting from any interest received and\nobliged to reimburse any losses incurred; and  \nagrees to expend those funds at the direction of the researcher.  \nAccounting treatment  \nUniversity G recognises a financial asset of $2 million for the funds received, in accordance with\nparagraph 3.1.1 of AASB 9. The university then considers whether it has transferred the financial asset to\nthe researcher, but notes that because it may invest the funds as it considers appropriate, the university\nretains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the funds.

The ticket price is $600 per head, and is\npartially refundable if the dinner is cancelled, in which case the customer will receive a refund of $300.\nBased on the menu, the retail price of the dinner at a local restaurant is $200 per ticket. Hosting the dinner\nalso provides patrons (customers) with the benefit of socialising with a wide range of community members\n(including networking) and the amount of consideration to which Entity B expects to be entitled in\nexchange for transferring the promised goods or services (the dinner and networking) to the customer is\n$250.  \nEntity B determines there is a contract with a customer to be accounted for under AASB 15, as there is:  \nan enforceable contract due to the return obligation; and  \na sufficiently specific performance obligation requiring the provision of the dinner and networking to\nthe customer, which would be satisfied at the point in time when provided.  \nEntity B determines that the presumption in paragraph F28 is rebutted as there is a partial refund in the\nevent of non-performance.

        "page_content=": "### Example 7A\u2014Upfront fee charged by an organisation\nAn organisation offers enrolment to prospective clients for the services it provides. Upon accepting an offer\nof enrolment, the prospective client must pay an upfront fee (sometimes referred to as an \u2018acceptance fee\u2019,\n\u2018entry fee\u2019 or \u2018enrolment fee\u2019). The enrolment form sets out the following terms and conditions relevant to\nthe fee:  \nupon payment of the fee, future service is guaranteed for the client to commence in the agreed-upon\nyear and on an ongoing basis;  \nthe fee is non-refundable and non-transferable; and  \nthe fee is not offset against any future fees that are charged on an ongoing basis for continued access to\nthe services.  \nThe analysis below sets out the process followed by not-for-profit entities in determining the accounting\ntreatment for upfront fees charged. The process does not specifically discuss any particular fee and is\napplied in the context of the relevant facts and circumstances of an entity\u2019s upfront fees. Note: the term\ncustomer is used in the analysis to cover all counterparties to an agreement, for example members or\nstudents.  \nAnalysis  \n_Is the contract within the scope of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers?_  \nThe entity first considers whether the agreement with the customer is within the scope of AASB 15, by\nreferring to AASB 15 paragraphs 9\u201321 and F5\u2013F19 to determine whether there is a contract with a\ncustomer:  \nIs there a customer who has promised consideration in exchange for goods or services from the entity\nand is the promise to transfer goods or services sufficiently specific? (AASB 15, paragraphs 9, Aus9.1\nand F5\u2013F7  \nIs there a written, oral or implied agreement, such as an application form or other document?\n(AASB 15, paragraphs 10 and F8\u2013F9)  \nDoes the agreement create enforceable rights and obligations for the parties? For example, could the\ncustomer either enforce the agreement or obtain other remedy under Australian law if the promised\nservice was not delivered? (AASB 15, paragraphs 10 and F10\u2013F18)  \nIn many cases where there will be an ongoing relationship with the customer following payment of the\nupfront fee, such as annual fees to access a service, revenue would be recognised in accordance with\nAASB 15. If multiple agreements are in place, for example an agreement for a joining fee and a separate\nagreement for the annual membership fee, then the guidance in paragraph 17 of AASB 15 should be\nconsidered in relation to combining the agreements for accounting purposes.  \n_What are the performance obligations in the contract, and are the activities associated with the non-_\n_refundable upfront fee one of these performance obligations?_  \nThe entity considers the guidance on:  \naccounting for non-refundable fees in AASB 15, paragraphs B48\u2013B51; and  \nidentifying performance obligations in AASB 15, paragraphs 22\u201330 and F20\u2013F27;  \n-----  to determine whether the upfront fee relates to the transfer of a good or service separate to the provision of\nservices in the future.  \nIn performing this analysis, the entity notes that performance obligations do not include activities that an\nentity must undertake to fulfil a contract (eg setting up a customer on the system, printing membership cards\nand similar) unless those activities transfer a good or service to the customer (AASB 15, paragraph 25). The\nnon-refundable fee might cover internal administrative activities that enable the entity to provide future\nservices to the customer. However, these activities do not transfer a promised good or service to the\ncustomer separate from the provision of future services and therefore do not satisfy a separate performance\nobligation (AASB 15, paragraph B51). If this is the case, the entity concludes that the non-refundable\nupfront fee \u2013 to the extent it relates to the internal administrative services \u2013 does not represent a payment for\na separate performance obligation but is in substance an advance payment for future services.  \nIn other circumstances, some or all of the upfront fee may relate to a separate performance obligation or\nobligations, whether satisfied at or near contract inception or otherwise.  \n_How is the revenue for the upfront fee recognised?_  \nWhere the activity does not result in a transfer of a good or service to the customer that satisfies a separate\nperformance obligation and the upfront fee is an advance payment for performance obligations to be\nsatisfied in the future, the upfront fee is recognised as revenue as these future services are provided, that is,\nover the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied. If the entity has charged the non-refundable\nfee in part as compensation for costs incurred in setting up a contract (or other administrative tasks) and\nthose setup activities are not a separate performance obligation, they should be disregarded when measuring\nprogress towards completion of the services (AASB 15, paragraph B51). The revenue recognition period\nwill extend beyond the initial contractual period if the entity grants the customer the option to renew the\ncontract and that option provides the customer with a material right (eg no requirement to pay a further\njoining fee on renewal) (AASB 15, paragraphs B40 and B49). Annual fees charged to access the services\nwill be recognised as revenue over the period that the services are provided.  \nIn the circumstances where some or all of the upfront fee relates to a separate performance obligation or\nobligations, the relevant portion of the upfront fee is recognised as revenue when the separate performance\nobligations are satisfied.  \nAccounting treatment  \nThe organisation applies AASB 15 paragraphs 9\u201321 and F5\u2013F19 and concludes that the agreement is within\nthe scope of AASB 15, as:  \nthere is a customer \u2013 the client \u2013 who has promised consideration in exchange for future services (an\nordinary activity of the organisation) to be provided to a specified recipient (AASB 15, paragraphs 6\nand F6\u2013F7); and  \na contract exists, as there is a written agreement (AASB 15, paragraphs 10 and F8\u2013F9) that creates\nenforceable rights and obligations for the client to receive services in the agreed-upon years. Despite\nthe fee being non-refundable, the client could either enforce the agreement or obtain remedy under\nAustralian law if the organisation did not provide services in the agreed-upon years (AASB 15,\nparagraphs 10 and F10\u2013F18).  \nThe organisation considers the guidance on accounting for non-refundable fees in AASB 15 paragraphs\nB48\u2013B51 and refers to paragraphs 22\u201330 and F20\u2013F27 to assess whether the upfront fee relates to the\ntransfer of a good or service separate to the provision of services in the future.  \nThe organisation concludes that the non-refundable upfront fee does not relate to an activity that represents\na separate performance obligation (AASB 15, paragraph 25), and therefore the fee is included in the\nconsideration for the performance obligation(s) in the agreement (to provide future services). The upfront\nfee is treated as an advance payment for future services and is recognised as revenue over the period of the\nongoing services (AASB 15, paragraphs 30 and B49).  \n-----  ",

Licensor is responsible for protecting the exclusivity\nof the arrangement and will be responsible for the payment of damages to Licensee if exclusivity is\nbreached;  \nas part of the arrangement, Licensor is responsible for performing a number of regulatory oversight and\nmonitoring activities prior to issuing the licence and ongoing throughout the licensing period to ensure\nLicensee and operation of the casino remain free from criminal influence or exploitation, and gaming\nin the casino is conducted honestly; and  \nthe cost for issuing the casino licence (including surveying the proposed gaming premises and the\nupfront and ongoing regulatory activities) is expected to be $100,000.  \n_Applying the accounting framework for licences issued by not-for-profit public sector licensors_  \nIs the arrangement a licence or a tax?  \nLicensor applies paragraph G3 and concludes its arrangement with Licensee is not a tax, on the basis that\nthe majority of the indicators support a licence classification:  \n-----  it is a discretionary arrangement entered into by each of the parties;  \nits primary purpose is not generating income for the public sector, but ensuring that the participation of\nthe general public in gaming activities is controlled, provided in a safe environment and protected from\ncriminal influence and exploitation. The low costs of $100,000 in comparison to the licence payment of\n$100 million may be indicative of a tax element (see below);  \nit contains an obligation for Licensor to issue a casino licence, and creates enforceable rights for\nLicensee to conduct gaming activities;  \nit gives Licensee specific permission to provide gaming activities which would otherwise be unlawful;  \nthere is no underlying asset of Licensor that is transferred to Licensee.  \nLicensor applies paragraphs G4\u2013G6 and concludes there is no tax element that needs to be separated.\nAlthough the arrangement has a low cost in relation to the consideration received, which might be\nindicative of a tax element, the transaction price is not refundable, and there is no other evidence indicating\nsimilar activities operating through different structures (such as online gaming) are subject to a tax.\nAccordingly, the criteria necessary to rebut the presumption for Licensor to allocate the transaction price of\n$100 million wholly to the licence are not satisfied.  \nIs it a low-value or short-term licence?  \nApplying paragraphs Aus8.1 and G22\u2013G27, Licensor concludes that its arrangement with Licensee is not a\nlow-value or short-term licence because the transaction price of the licence is $100 million and the term of\nthe licence is 10 years.  \nIs it an intellectual property (IP) licence?  \nApplying paragraph G13, Licensor concludes its arrangement with Licensee is a non-IP licence as the\narrangement does not involve rights over IP of Licensor.  \nIs the non-IP licence a lease or does it contain a lease?  \nApplying paragraphs Aus5.2 and G14(a), Licensor concludes its arrangement with Licensee gives Licensee\na right to perform an activity (ie operate a casino) rather than conveying a right over an identified asset of\nthe Licensor. Therefore the arrangement is not a lease and does not contain a lease.  \nIdentifying the performance obligation  \n_Who is the customer?_  \nApplying paragraph G16, Licensee (Casino Operator B) is identified as the customer. Licensee has entered\ninto an arrangement with Licensor to obtain goods or services that are an output of Licensor\u2019s ordinary\nactivities in exchange for consideration.  \n_What are the goods and services promised in the arrangement?_  \nApplying paragraphs G18\u2013G21, Licensor concludes the only goods and services transferred to Licensee (the\ncustomer) is the licence itself, being the \u2018right to perform\u2019 gambling activities.  \nLicensor observes that the following promises/activities are not performance obligations as they do not\ntransfer additional goods or services to Licensee, beyond the licence itself, but instead either confirm the\nattributes promised at inception of the licence or confirm that the terms of the licence have been met:  \nrefraining from issuing new casino licences in geographical location C as the licence is exclusive (ie an\nexclusive licence is issued and continues throughout the licence period); and  \nperforming regulatory activities to monitor that Licensee continues to meet the eligibility criteria\n(including that the gaming offered is honest and free from criminal influence) during the period of the\nlicence. The Licensee must meet the eligibility criteria to be issued the licence and controls whether the\ncriteria continue to be met, so no additional goods or services are provided by the licensor.  \nLicensor does not identify any remaining promises to transfer a good or service to Licensee in the\narrangement that are distinct from the licence.  \nLicensor concludes there is a single distinct performance obligation to issue the licence.",

        "page_content=": "## The need for change  \nBC2 Prior to the issue of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the recognition and measurement\nrequirements for transactions of not-for-profit entities giving rise to income depended on whether the\ntransaction was reciprocal or non-reciprocal in nature. The accounting for income arising from reciprocal\ntransactions was predominantly addressed in AASB 118 Revenue and AASB 111 Construction Contracts.\nThe accounting for income arising from non-reciprocal transactions was addressed in AASB 1004\n_Contributions._  \nBC3 The Board observed determining whether a transaction was reciprocal or non-reciprocal in practice was not\nalways straightforward. Entities found it challenging to determine whether approximately equal value had\nbeen provided in exchange to the other party or parties to the transfer, and contended that in many instances\nthe immediate recognition of income in a non-reciprocal transaction did not faithfully represent the\nunderlying financial performance of the entity. Constituents noted that identifying reciprocal transactions\nwas difficult and that diverse interpretations existed, with some entities recognising transactions with return\nobligations and specified performance outcomes as reciprocal transactions and some not. Constituents were\nalso concerned about the income recognition requirements as applied to grants, appropriations and other\ntransfers of assets made on the condition that the not-for-profit entity deliver goods or services to nominated\nthird parties. Constituents also noted difficulties in discussing financial information with grantors/donors\nwhen explaining why they needed additional resources when the financial statements indicated no such\nneed because of the immediate income recognition requirement of AASB 1004. Users noted they did not\nthink the financial statements were reflecting the economic reality of the not-for-profit entities\u2019 financial\ncircumstances. Accordingly, the Board decided to undertake a project to conduct a fundamental review of\nthe income recognition requirements applying to not-for-profit entities.  \nBC4 As a consequence of its policy on transaction neutrality, the Board gave consideration to International\nAccounting Standards Board developments in the accounting for revenue; finalised with the issue of\nIFRS 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014 and noted it needed to determine what, if_\nany, amendments and guidance would be required to enable not-for-profit entities to apply this Standard. In\naddition, the Board noted the application of the performance obligation approach to revenue recognition\nadopted in IFRS 15, using a broader concept of customer had the potential to resolve some of the issues\nnoted with AASB 1004. The Board also had regard to the work of the International Public Sector\nAccounting Standards Board (IPSASB) in developing its income recognition requirements for \u2018nonexchange\u2019 transactions.  \nBC5 The Board\u2019s proposals with respect to the accounting for income of not-for-profit entities finalised in this\nStandard were exposed for public comment in April 2015 as part of ED 260 _Income of Not-for-Profit_\n_Entities. In developing ED 260, the Board considered both the feedback received on the immediate_\npredecessor Exposure Draft, ED 180 Income from Non-Exchange Transactions (Taxes and Transfers), and\nthe requirements of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ED 260 proposed both revisions to\nthe income recognition principles in AASB 1004, and development of guidance and illustrative examples to\nassist not-for-profit entities in implementing AASB 15.  \nBC6 As part of its due process on this project, the Board held roundtables in Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney and\nCanberra, and discussed the proposals at various forums, workshops and discussion groups. In addition, to\nhelp ensure it considered implications of its proposals on entities with different objectives (eg charities,\nlocal government), the Board conducted several targeted meetings. The Board received comments on its\nexposed proposals both formally via 34 submissions on the Exposure Draft, and informally via email,\nmeetings with constituents, presentations to various bodies and social media. About half the respondents to  \n-----  the Exposure Draft explicitly considered that overall, the proposals would result in financial statements that\nwould be useful to users. Other respondents were supportive of the Board\u2019s efforts in this area but\nconsidered that the proposals did not fully address the concerns noted in paragraph BC3. Following the\nconsultation period, and after considering constituent comments received, the Board decided to proceed\nwith issuing revised principles for the recognition and measurement of income of not-for-profit entities.  \nBC7 In response to the feedback received, the Board amended or clarified various proposals in the Exposure\nDraft as part of issuing the final guidance. As part of its processes in this regard, the Board decided to\nestablish a Project Advisory Panel consisting of preparers and advisors to provide input to the revised\nproposals. The Board considered that, overall, its decisions on this project did not significantly depart from\nthose exposed in a manner that adversely affects entities applying the Standard. However, in order to\nsatisfy itself that sufficient due process had been undertaken, the Board invited public comment on both a\ndiscussion draft before the Board at its August 2016 meeting and a fatal flaw draft \u2013 publicised via its\nweekly newsletter.  \nBC8 The Board decided to finalise its proposals exposed in ED 260 by:  \n(a) issuing AASB 1058 to address the accounting for income of not-for-profit entities. The Standard\nestablishes principles for not-for-profit entities that apply to transactions where the consideration\nto acquire an asset is significantly less than fair value principally to enable a not-for-profit entity\nto further its objectives, and to the receipt of volunteer services;  \n(b) issuing AASB 2016-8 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Australian_\n_Implementation Guidance for Not-for-Profit Entities_ to add implementation guidance to\nAASB 15 and AASB 9 as well as illustrative examples to AASB 15 to assist not-for-profit\nentities in applying the Standard;  \n(c) retaining AASB 1004 _Contributions, amended to exclude transactions now addressed by_\nAASB 1058; and  \n(d) issuing AASB 2016-7 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013_ _Deferral of AASB 15_\n_for Not-for-Profit Entities to defer the effective date of AASB 15 for application by not-for-profit_\nentities.",

        "page_content=": "## Amendments to AASB 9  \nNon-contractual receivables arising from statutory requirements  \nBC9 In ED 260 the Board proposed asset recognition requirements for AASB 1058 that overrode the recognition\ncriteria of other Australian Accounting Standards. Under those proposals entities would have recognised an\nasset and measured it at fair value in accordance with the proposed requirements and then subsequently\nmeasured that asset in accordance with its applicable Standard. In its redeliberations on ED 260 the Board\ndecided not to proceed with the asset recognition requirements it proposed in the ED. Instead, the Board\ndecided to clarify consequential amendments to other Standards that specify the initial measurement\nrequirements for transactions within the scope of AASB 1058.  \nBC10 As part of its redeliberations the Board observed that entities with statutory receivables, such as from taxes\nand fines, would not be required to apply AASB 9 to those receivables as they are not financial assets as\ndefined in AASB 132 _Financial Instruments: Presentation because there is no contract that provides the_\nentity with the right to future cash flows. However, the Board held the view that the initial fair value\nmeasurement requirements of AASB 9 are the most appropriate for the types of receivables under\nconsideration as the economic substance of contractual receivables and receivables arising from statutory\nrequirements is similar at initial recognition and therefore decided to require that AASB 9 be applied for the\ninitial measurement of such receivables. The Board also considered that requiring entities to apply AASB 9\nfor the initial measurement of non-contractual receivables arising from statutory obligations addressed the\nuncertainty surrounding the appropriate treatment of those receivables.  \nBC11 Accordingly, the Board decided to amend AASB 9 to require that non-contractual receivables arising from\nstatutory requirements should initially be measured in accordance with that Standard as if those receivables\nwere financial instruments. The Board considered whether the subsequent measurement requirements of\nAASB 9 should also apply to statutory receivables; however, the Board noted:  \n(a) constituent feedback indicating the impact of the subsequent measurement requirements of\nAASB 9 needs further consideration; and  \n-----  (b) the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) had recently embarked on\nits Public Sector Specific Financial Instruments project to consider requirements for public sector\nfinancial instruments that are not within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.  \nBC12 Accordingly, the Board decided not to require entities to apply the subsequent measurement requirements of\nAASB 9 to statutory receivables. Instead, the Board decided to monitor the IPSASB\u2019s project and consider\nthe subsequent measurement of statutory receivables in a future project.  \nBC13 The Board noted that applying AASB 9 only for initial recognition of non-contractual statutory receivables\ncould cause confusion and therefore decided to add guidance to accompany AASB 9.  \nBC14 The Board decided not to address non-contractual payables at this stage, given the scope of the project is\nrelated to income of not-for-profit entities. However, the Board decided to consider non-contractual\npayables at a future date while monitoring the work of the IPSASB on its public sector specific financial\ninstruments project.",

        "page_content=": "## Amendments to AASB 15  \nBC15 The Board conducted a comprehensive review of AASB 15 to determine where additional not-for-profit\nguidance might be required. As a result, the Board decided to develop guidance for not-for-profit entities\nincluding addressing:  \n(a) how not-for-profit entities should apply terminology used in AASB 15;  \n(b) when an agreement with another party creates enforceable rights and obligations; and  \n(c) how to identify when performance obligations exist, requiring a promise to transfer a good or a\nservice to be specified in sufficient detail to be able to determine when the obligation is satisfied.  \nBC16 In addition to the guidance mentioned above, the Board also decided to make some amendments to the body\nof AASB 15:  \n(a) to require that transfers which enable an entity to acquire or construct a non-financial asset to be\ncontrolled by the entity be accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058, not AASB 15; and  \n(b) to clarify that any contract that is not enforceable or does not contain sufficiently specific\nperformance obligations is not within the scope of AASB 15 for not-for-profit entities.  \nBC17 The Board observed that not-for-profit entities might receive transfers of financial assets that the entity must\nuse to acquire or construct a non-financial asset that the entity will control. The Board noted various views\non the requirements that should apply to these transfers, which could result in divergence in practice. The\nBoard considered that these transfers are an in-substance transfer of the underlying non-financial asset the\nentity must acquire or construct. Accordingly, the Board decided to specify accounting requirements for\nthese transfers in AASB 1058 and to clearly state that these transfers are not within the scope of AASB 15\nfor not-for-profit entities.  \nBC18 The Board noted that paragraph 15 of AASB 15 specifies requirements for contracts with customers that do\nnot meet the criteria in paragraph 9 of AASB 15. For the purposes of the guidance the Board developed to\naccompany AASB 15 the Board noted, in particular, that some of the criteria in paragraph 9 relate to\nenforceable agreements and sufficiently specific performance obligations. The Board considered that the\nrequirements of paragraph 15 would create ambiguity in the context of AASB 1058 and the additional\nguidance the Board developed to accompany AASB 15. Consequently, the Board decided to amend\nAASB 15 to state that any contract of a not-for-profit entity that is not enforceable or does not contain\nsufficiently specific performance obligations is not within the scope of AASB 15. Moreover, not-for-profit\nentities would need to consider whether that contract should be accounted for in accordance with\nAASB 1058. The Board noted that this amendment would help to avoid confusion and divergence in\npractice.",

        "page_content=": "## Terminology  \nBC19 Not-for-profit entities often receive assets through grants and other transactions, where those transactions:  \n(a) are not described as contracts, even though they may be part of agreements that specify the goods\nor services to be transferred by the recipient of the grant;  \n(b) are not described as transactions with \u2018customers\u2019;  \n(c) might impose an obligation to transfer goods or services; or  \n-----  (d) might require a not-for-profit entity to provide benefits to third party beneficiaries when they\ntransfer promised goods or services.  \nIn these circumstances, the party, or parties, that should be regarded as the \u2018customers\u2019 might be unclear.  \nBC20 The Board considered whether to make modifications to some terms in AASB 15 that would be clearer for\nnot-for-profit entities to apply. In developing ED 260 the Board decided to maintain a transaction-neutral\napproach to any modifications it might consider to AASB 15. In this context, the Board reviewed the\ndefinitions of a \u2018customer\u2019 and of a \u2018contract\u2019 to determine whether a modification was necessary or\nwhether additional not-for-profit guidance would be sufficient.  \nBC21 The Board concluded that these aspects do not warrant using different terms other than \u2018contract\u2019 and\n\u2018customer\u2019 because additional guidance on how those terms apply in a not-for-profit context would provide\nsufficient direction for entities while maintaining the Board\u2019s transaction-neutral approach. Accordingly, in\nED 260 the Board decided to clarify those terms in a not-for-profit entity context. Feedback on ED 260\nindicated broad support for the proposed clarifications, and therefore the Board decided to finalise its\nproposals in that regard.",

The Board noted the IASB\u2019s considerations in its Basis for Conclusions to IFRS 15, specifically\nparagraphs BC54 and BC55 where the IASB argued that the definition of a \u2018customer\u2019 could extend beyond\nthe parties specifically identified in a contract, thereby potentially satisfying the definition of a \u2018customer\u2019\nto be in scope of IFRS 15. The Board noted that the IASB\u2019s considerations highlighted in paragraphs BC54\nand BC55 concur with the Board\u2019s views. However, the Board noted that while the IASB expressed this\nview in its Basis for Conclusions to IFRS 15, not-for-profit entities would need more authoritative\nguidance.  \nBC23 Consistent with the IASB\u2019s conclusions, the Board acknowledged that identifying the \u2018customer\u2019 in a\ncontract may not always be straightforward for not-for-profit entities. For example, the Board noted that\nnot-for-profit entities routinely receive grants where the grantor requires the entity to provide services to\nunspecified third parties. In all other respects the grant would be within the scope of AASB 15. In this\nexample, it is unclear whether those unspecified third parties could be considered \u2018customers\u2019 in the\ncontract or whether the grantor is the customer.  \nBC24 The Board clarified that in contracts with customers, the customer is usually the party that has contracted\nwith the entity for those goods or services and promises consideration in exchange for those goods or\nservices, regardless of whether there are third party beneficiaries. Although this principle applies to entities\nin both the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, the Board decided to add not-for-profit entity clarification of\nthis principle, in view of:  \n(a) the likely greater prevalence of third party beneficiaries in contracts entered by not-for-profit\nentities; and  \n(a) uncertainty about this issue expressed to the Board in its project outreach activities.",

The Board considered that this\ndefinition and guidance are sufficiently broad to address the issues noted in paragraph BC19, and should\nreadily be able to be applied by not-for-profit entities. The Board acknowledged, however, that clarification\nwas necessary for not-for-profit entities in relation to some specific aspects of applying the definition.  \nBC26 The Board observed that not-for-profit entities might require additional guidance to distinguish sufficiently\nspecific performance obligations for the purposes of AASB 15 and constructive obligations for the purposes\nof AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. In particular, the Board considered\na range of statements not-for-profit entities make regarding, for example, their purpose or reason for a\nparticular fundraising.

        "page_content=": "## Enforceable agreements  \nBC29 The Board noted that obligations can include those that are legal, constructive and economic in nature.\nAASB 15 states that a contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights\nand obligations. The Basis for Conclusions to IFRS 15 paragraph BC32 states that in determining whether\na contractual right or obligation is enforceable is a question to be considered within the context of the\nrelevant legal framework (or equivalent framework) that exists to ensure that the parties\u2019 rights and\nobligations are upheld. In ED 260 the Board decided to propose not-for-profit entity-specific guidance to\nhelp entities identify whether an agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. This is because:  \n(a) moral obligation and economic compulsion can be seen as the motivation for many of the\nactivities of not-for-profit entities;  \n(b) some mechanisms for enforcing a not-for-profit entity\u2019s promises to transfer goods or services are\nunique to entities (typically not-for-profit) in the public sector. For example, Ministerial\ndirectives might be employed to compel promised transfers of goods or services by a not-forprofit entity; and  \n(c) some agreements between different levels of government might rely on a common purpose,\nwithout the transferor funding a programme necessarily having the power to enforce the\ntransferee entity\u2019s promises to provide goods or services.  \nBC30 In developing the Exposure Draft, and in finalising the requirements of this Standard, the Board sought\ninput from legal practitioners on some of the most common characteristics that could make an arrangement\nenforceable.  \nBC31 The Board observed that AASB 15 paragraph 10 states that the enforceability of rights and obligations in a\ncontract is a matter of law. In this regard, the Board noted Australian law has a legal mechanism for the\nresolution of contractual disputes that establish the rights of a separate party, being the judiciary, to oblige\nthe entity to act in a particular way thereby leaving that entity with little, if any, discretion to avoid settling\nan obligation. For an agreement to be enforceable by equivalent means would require the presence of a\nmechanism outside of the legal system that establishes the right of a separate party to oblige the entity to act\nin a particular way thereby leaving that entity with little, if any, discretion to avoid settling an obligation.  \nBC32 The Board considered that an obligation to return consideration that accompanies a not-for-profit entity\u2019s\npromise to transfer goods or services would make the agreement enforceable. If a transferor in an\nagreement presently holds rights to a refund or other compensation in the event of the transferee entity\u2019s\nnon-performance, the transferor might choose to, for convenience, \u2018net settle\u2019 by deducting the refund\namount from a future transfer. Cancelling future funding to which the entity is presently entitled is a\ncancellation of a debt owed to the entity and is, in substance, a refund of promised consideration.\nTherefore, the capacity to cancel future funding to which the entity is presently entitled would make the\narrangement enforceable by legal or equivalent means.  \nBC33 In contrast to the capacity referred to in paragraph BC32, a transferor\u2019s capacity to withhold future funding\nto which the entity is not presently entitled is substantially different. The ability of a funding provider to\nwithhold future, uncommitted, funding is a source of economic compulsion for the funding recipient. This\nis because the recipient might be economically compelled to undertake a present activity to secure that\nfuture funding. Economic compulsion is not, of itself, a source of enforceability of a promise. In other\nwords, circumstances affecting possible future transactions are not a feature of existing contractual rights\nand obligations.  \nBC34 The Board observed that, if economic compulsion were sufficient to make a promise enforceable, a\ngovernment\u2019s explicit and implicit promises to provide social benefits (such as age pensions, and health and  \n-----  education services) potentially would qualify as enforceable obligations in a wide range of circumstances.\nConsequently, a government might identify liabilities for benefits for which members of the community\nhave yet to qualify, as the government would be economically compelled to provide the benefits at some\npoint in the future (for example, on an aggregate basis, there is no doubt that of those already born, a\nsignificant percentage will survive to qualify for the aged pension and will need to receive various health\nservices). The Board currently considers that identifying liabilities so broadly would not provide useful\ninformation about a government\u2019s present financial position, although information about likely future\ntransfers of social benefits would be useful for long-term fiscal sustainability reporting. The Board notes\nthat the IPSASB is presently considering the range of recognition points in its project on accounting for\nsocial benefits.  \nBC35 Feedback to the guidance provided in ED 260 indicated constituents would continue to have difficulty\napplying the \u2018enforceable\u2019 criterion, despite the proposed additional guidance. In considering the feedback\nreceived, the Board significantly expanded the \u2018enforceability\u2019 guidance to include a range of factors that\ncould potentially result in an enforceable arrangement. The Board clarified that a return obligation is\nmerely an indicator of enforceability, and not the only indicator. The Board also noted that where parties to\nthe arrangement need to mutually agree on any changes to the use to which transferred funds are put, that\nthis constitutes enforceability, as neither party has the ability to unilaterally make decisions regarding the\nassets transferred. The Board noted, however, that the guidance is general in nature and, while it is intended\nto be helpful in assisting entities assess the enforceability of arrangements, it does not constitute legal\nadvice. Accordingly, the Board noted that, depending on the complexity of the individual facts and\ncircumstances, entities might still need to obtain specific legal advice in regard to their arrangements.  \nBC36 The Board also sought feedback from its Project Advisory Panel on the revised guidance on enforceability\nand observed the feedback was generally positive. The Panel considered the guidance was useful within the\nconfines of not providing specific legal advice. Accordingly, the Board decided to finalise its clarifications\nby including the additional guidance in the final Standard.",

        "page_content=": "### Sufficiently specific requirements\nBC38 Some transfers of assets to not-for-profit entities are provided with no, or minimal, terms and conditions\nregarding how the transferred assets must be used other than that the assets are used for purposes consistent\nwith the entity\u2019s service-delivery objectives as set out in its constitution or enabling legislation (where\napplicable). For example, a charity may have the discretion to change the goods or services to be provided\nusing donated assets, even when the donations are received in specific-purpose fundraising appeals, to\nenable the charity to redirect aid to those in greatest need as circumstances change. Some other transfers to\nnot-for-profit entities are provided solely on condition that the funds are to be expended within a specified\ntime period. For these reasons, it can be difficult to distinguish goods or services provided to meet this\ngeneral requirement from any of the not-for-profit entity\u2019s other goods or services provided.  \nBC39 The circumstances described in paragraph BC38 are much more prevalent in the not-for-profit sector than\nthe for-profit sector, and may raise issues regarding which terms and conditions attached to assets\ntransferred to a not-for-profit entity give rise to performance obligations. The Board decided to propose a\nprinciple in ED 260 that to qualify as a performance obligation, a not-for-profit entity\u2019s enforceable promise\nto transfer goods or services must be sufficiently specific to allow the entity to determine when the\nperformance obligation is satisfied, as this indicates the transfer of goods or services is not at the discretion\nof the provider.  \nBC40 The Board also decided to propose not-for-profit entity guidance:  \n(a) noting that applying the \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 criterion requires judgement; and  \n(b) identifying particular conditions to consider in determining whether a promise is \u2018sufficiently\nspecific\u2019 to qualify as a performance obligation.  \nBC41 The Board considered whether to identify particular conditions as essential for treating a promise to transfer\na good or a service as \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019. The Board concluded that:  \n-----  (a) no particular condition regarding a promise to provide a good or service would ensure the\nproposed principle in paragraph BC39 is met; and  \n(b) prescribing condition(s) that are necessary to make a promise \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 might\narbitrarily and unintentionally exclude some performance obligations from being identified as\nsuch.  \nBC42 For example, the Board:  \n(a) noted that paragraph 26 of AASB 15 states that: \u201cDepending on the contract, promised goods or\nservices may include, but are not limited to \u2026 (e) providing a service of standing ready to\nprovide goods or services (for example, unspecified updates to software that are provided on a\nwhen-and-if-available basis) or of making goods or services available for a customer to use as\nand when the customer decides\u201d; and  \n(b) concluded that, if particular aspects of a \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 promise were to be mandatorily\npresent, a not-for-profit entity\u2019s promise to provide a service of standing ready to provide an\nunspecified good or service might be treated as \u2018insufficiently specific\u2019 to qualify as a\nperformance obligation. This outcome would be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s policy of\ntransaction neutrality.  \nBC43 One of the aspects to consider in assessing whether a promise is \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 to qualify as a\nperformance obligation is a specified period over which promised goods or services must be transferred. In\nrelation to that aspect, the Board concluded that a condition that a transfer of assets to a not-for-profit entity\nrelates to a particular time period does not, of itself, meet the \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 criterion \u2013 the nature or\ntype of goods or services to be transferred by that entity over that time period must also be specified. This\nis because time does not require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits (the definition of a\nliability in the AASB Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements requires an\noutflow of resources in settlement of the obligation). Rather, the Board considers that such a condition is,\nin substance, an indication that the transferor does not intend to make similar future transfers to the entity\nfor a defined period of time.  \nBC44 The Board considered whether its view above is consistent with treating as \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 a not-forprofit entity\u2019s promise to provide a service of standing ready to provide an unspecified good or service. The\nBoard concluded that a promise to provide a service of standing ready to provide an unspecified good or\nservice is substantially different from a condition that a transfer of assets to a not-for-profit entity relates to\na particular time period, without any other conditions. This is because:  \n(a) standing ready to transfer a specified underlying good or service (eg to make a good available for\na customer to use as and when the customer decides) is, of itself, a specifically identifiable\nservice transferred to the customer, even if the underlying good or service is sometimes difficult\nto identify; and  \n(b) promises to use transferred assets consistently with the entity\u2019s general objectives are not\npromises to transfer a good or a service.  \nBC45 The Board noted the majority of feedback on ED 260 indicated support for the principle described in\nparagraph BC39. Some constituents raised concerns about:  \n(a) linking \u2018enforceability\u2019 with \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 for grant arrangements could mean many\ngrants do not fall within the scope of AASB 15;  \n(b) measuring progress toward satisfying a performance obligation would be difficult in many of the\narrangements not-for-profit entities enter into;  \n(c) how to determine whether goods or services are transferred, and if so how to determine when a\ntransfer occurs. For example, when research is undertaken as part of a research grant, it may be\nunclear whether, or when, or what type of, a transfer of goods or services occurs; and  \n(d) determining if a contract is within the scope of AASB 15 if the customer does not receive the\npromised goods or services because it directs the entity to transfer those goods or services to third\nparties.  \nBC46 In regard to research grants, the Board noted that such grants typically:  \n(a) require the recipient to undertake a specified research activity, usually on the basis of a proposal\nin the grant application;  \n(b) require the researcher to publicly publish their research findings, either in a government report, a\nresearch journal or a similar format;  \n(c) identify the owner of the intellectual property generated by the research activity; and  \n-----  (d) may involve the licensing of the intellectual property to the grantor, another entity or the general\npublic.  \nBC47 The Board observed that the above features of research grants would typically be sufficiently specific but\nmay cause difficulty in measuring progress toward the satisfaction of a performance obligation that is\nsatisfied over time. The Board noted that paragraphs 39\u201345 of AASB 15 focus on measuring progress\ntoward satisfying a performance obligation with reference to input methods and output methods. The Board\nobserved that either of these methods could be problematic to apply in the context of performing research as\nrequired by a research grant. Accordingly, the Board decided to clarify that the undertaking of the research,\nwhich may be seen as an activity undertaken on behalf of another party, could constitute a service for the\npurposes of AASB 15. For example, the Board noted that the transfer of the intellectual property created by\nthe research to the grantor could represent the transfer of a good or service in satisfaction of a performance\nobligation. The Board also decided to add illustrative examples addressing the application of AASB 15 in\nthe case of research grants, considering issues that might arise when the researcher retains the intellectual\nproperty, provides a licence to the grantor or other parties, or provides or publishes research findings, such\nas the recognition of revenue over time or at a point in time.  \nBC48 In response to further feedback received on the Exposure Draft, the Board included additional guidance on\nboth \u2018enforceability\u2019 and \u2018performance obligations\u2019. In particular the Board clarified:  \n(a) when a grant could be considered as part of an enforceable agreement (such as if a return\nobligation exists and other circumstances as set out in BC29\u2013BC36) and how to determine\nwhether the requirements of the grant are sufficiently specific;  \n(b) the effect of time-period conditions on whether a performance obligation exists;  \n(c) whether a grant made to a \u2018single purpose\u2019 entity to be used for its sole purpose constituted a\nperformance obligation; and  \n(d) the recipient of the transferred goods or services need not be the customer identified in the\ncontract for the contract to be within the scope of AASB 15.  \nBC49 Consequently, the Board retained in the final Standard the principle that a performance obligation only\nexists if it is sufficiently specific to enable the entity to determine when it has satisfied that obligation. In\nresponse to the feedback on ED 260 the Board finalised its proposals with the additional guidance noted\nabove.",

        "page_content=": "## Allocating the transaction price to performance obligations  \nBC50 A customer may enter into a contract with a not-for-profit entity with a dual purpose of obtaining goods or\nservices and helping the not-for-profit entity achieve its objectives. The Board considered that, to represent\nfaithfully the substantially different components of such a contract of a not-for-profit entity, in principle it is\nimportant that the amount of consideration that is not attributable to the goods or services promised by the\nentity to its customer should be:  \n(a) measured and disclosed separately from the revenue arising from transferring a good or service to\nthe customer; and  \n(b) recognised when the entity recognises the transferred asset(s) \u2013 which might be a different time\nfrom when the entity transfers the promised good or service to the customer.  \nBC51 Accordingly, the Board proposed in ED 260 to require a separately identifiable \u201cdonation\u201d component in a\ncontract with a customer to be accounted for as income immediately. ED 260 proposed that such a\ncomponent should be identified in a two-step model:  \n(a) determine whether the customer intended to make a donation to the entity; and  \n(b) separately identify the component from the goods or services promised in the contract.  \nBC52 Feedback on the ED 260 model indicated significant concern in relation to implementing the two-step\nprocess. The primary concern raised was that assessing the customer\u2019s intent when making the donation\nwould be highly subjective and, for many transactions, such an assessment could not be made due to a lack\nof evidence. Despite these concerns, the majority of respondents agreed that any \u201cdonation\u201d component\nincluded in a contract with a customer should be separated from the contract and accounted for in\naccordance with AASB 1058.  \nBC53 To address constituent concerns the Board decided to replace the two-step model with a rebuttable\npresumption. The presumption is that the total transaction price in a contract with a customer is related to\nthe transfer of the promised goods or services. That is, the entire transaction price is presumed to\ncompensate the entity for the goods or services. Where the transaction price is only partially related to the  \n-----  transfer of the promised goods or services the presumption is rebutted and the transaction price split into its\ncomponent parts.  \nBC54 The Board noted, however, that requiring entities to rebut the presumption solely based on whether a\ncomponent of the transaction price is not related to the transfer of promised goods or services might be\ndifficult to apply in practice. The Board considered that such an approach would impose undue cost and\neffort to require entities to assess the nature of component parts of the transaction price for every contract\nwith a customer. Such a requirement would be particularly difficult in the case of research grants, as\ndiscussed in paragraphs BC46 and BC47. To address this concern, the Board decided to require that the\npresumption be rebutted only when the transaction is partially refundable in the event the entity does not\ndeliver the promised goods or services.  \nBC55 The Board observed that a partially refundable transaction price usually indicates that some part of the\ntransaction price might not relate to the transfer of the promised goods or services. A non-refundable\ncomponent of the transaction price might represent a donation or grant to the entity. However, the Board\nalso noted the guidance in paragraphs B48\u2013B51 of AASB 15 which relate to non-refundable upfront fees.\nThat guidance illustrates that in some cases a non-refundable upfront fee could still relate to the transfer of\npromised goods or services, in which case the non-refundable upfront fee could form part of a performance\nobligation and be recognised as revenue when the obligation is satisfied. The Board noted that donations\nvery rarely relate to the transfer of promised goods or services and therefore concluded that its guidance\nattached to AASB 15 does not override the guidance of paragraphs B48\u2013B51.  \nBC56 The Board noted that the transaction price allocated to a performance obligation should adhere to the\nallocation objective in paragraph 73 of AASB 15. Moreover, the Board observed the IASB\u2019s discussion on\nthis topic as documented in paragraphs BC270\u2013BC273 of IFRS 15, in particular that any stand-alone selling\nprice estimated using the residual approach should be considered for appropriateness. Where the estimated\nstand-alone selling price is either nil, or a nominal amount, the entity should consider whether such an\noutcome is appropriate. Similarly, the Board is of the view that a donation element included in a contract\nwith a customer and allocated to a performance obligation using the residual approach should be considered\nfor appropriateness in the context of the allocation objective. If a donation element is allocated to a\nperformance obligation in this manner it might result in the transaction price being inappropriately\noverestimated.  \nBC57 The Board concluded the revised approach addressed constituent feedback on the two-step model it\nproposed in ED 260. In particular, the rebuttable presumption does not require entities to consider the\ncustomer\u2019s intent when entering into a contract with the entity. To help ensure the rebuttable presumption\nwas practicable, the Board sought feedback on this approach from its Project Advisory Panel. The Panel\nsupported the revised approach, and consequently the Board decided to finalise the rebuttable presumption.\nThe presumption ultimately applies the Board\u2019s view exposed in ED 260 that separate components of a\ncontract should be accounted for in accordance with the applicable Standard using the revised guidance.",

Constituents raised concerns on that proposal, noting (among\nothers):  \n(a) general uncertainty in the not-for-profit sector about the accounting requirements that would\napply given the Board\u2019s work on this project and the various proposals made over the lifetime of\nthe project;  \n(b) when AASB 1058 is issued not-for-profit entities will need to determine its interaction with\nAASB 15 and other Australian Accounting Standards. With a proposed effective date of\n1 January 2018, not-for-profit entities were concerned that their lead-time to apply the\nrequirements would be significantly less than that provided to for-profit entities to apply\nAASB 15; and  \n(c) AASB 1058 permits a greater number of other Australian Accounting Standards to apply to\ntransactions that were previously solely in scope of AASB 1004. Not-for-profit entities\ncommented that they needed further time to understand the interaction of those Standards with\ntheir transactions that previously were solely accounted for under AASB 1004.  \nBC61 The Board agreed with constituents and decided to defer the application date of AASB 1058 by one year to\n1 January 2019. In making this decision the Board also considered whether it should defer the application\ndate of AASB 15, including the application guidance in this Standard, by one year for not-for-profit entities.\nThe Board noted that having different application dates for AASB 1058 and AASB 15 would, among other\nissues:  \n(a) introduce a period where entities recognise revenue in accordance with AASB 15 and apply\nAASB 1004 to other transactions outside the scope of AASB 15; and  \n(b) potentially require entities to re-evaluate their contracts with customers for donation elements\nwhen applying AASB 1058 in a later period, thereby lengthening the transition process.  \nBC62 Consequently, the Board also deferred the application date of AASB 15 to 1 January 2019 for not-for-profit\nentities. In deferring the application date of AASB 15 the additional guidance for not-for-profit entities will\nalso be deferred. However, the Board decided to retain the ability for entities to apply AASB 15, including\nthe additional guidance for not-for-profit entities in this Standard, and AASB 1058 to an earlier reporting\nperiod, so long as they are applied together.",

Consequently, the Board agreed that the\nexamples accompanying the guidance should illustrate:  \n(a) enforceability;  \n(b) the application of the \u2018sufficiently specific\u2019 requirement; and  \n(c) separating a component not attributable to the goods or services promised by the entity to its\ncustomer in a contract with a customer.  \nBC65 The Board decided to add an example to those accompanying AASB 1058 that illustrates a transaction that\nincludes a contract with a customer. The example is intended to highlight when a transaction could include\na contract with a customer and then direct users to the guidance accompanying AASB 15. The Board\ndecided the remaining topics covered by illustrative examples in ED 260 should accompany AASB 1058.  \nBC66 When the Board developed the requirements in AASB 1058 for transfers of financial assets that enable an\nentity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the entity, the Board\ninitially did not limit the scope of the requirements only to recognisable assets. Upon redeliberating the\nissue, the Board decided to limit the scope of the requirements to only those non-financial assets that could\nbe recognised under another Australian Accounting Standard once acquired or constructed.  \n-----  BC67 As a consequence, the Board noted that some research grants would not necessarily be recognised as\nincome over time as the research was performed. Accordingly, the Board decided to develop further\nillustrative examples to those proposed in ED 260 to assist entities apply the requirements of AASB 15 to\nresearch grants.  \nBC68 In its redeliberations, the Board identified three scenarios that could apply to research grants, depending on\nthe terms and conditions of the grant, where the entity:  \n(a) is required to transfer the intellectual property it develops to the grantor;  \n(b) is required to provide a licence to the grantor for the intellectual property it develops; or  \n(c) transfers benefits to the grantor that may or may not be immediately consumed.  \nBC69 The Board decided to illustrate each of the above scenarios as examples, identifying the effect that various\nterms and conditions could have on whether revenue arising from the grant is recognised over time, or at a\npoint in time when a performance obligation is satisfied.",

        "page_content=": "## Comparison with International Public Sector Accounting Standards  \nBC70 As part of its deliberations, the Board considered the accounting for income of not-for-profit entities\nspecified by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB). The Board noted the\nfollowing International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) specified the accounting in this regard:  \n(a) IPSAS 9 Revenue from Exchange Transactions;  \n(b) IPSAS 11 Construction Contracts; and  \n(c) IPSAS 23 Revenue from Non-exchange Transactions (Taxes and Transfers).  \nBC71 The Board observed IPSAS 9 and IPSAS 11 are based on the principles of superseded IAS 18 _Revenue_\n(incorporated into AASB 118 Revenue) and IAS 11 _Construction Contracts (incorporated into AASB 111_\n_Construction Contracts), rather than those of IFRS 15_ _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_\n(incorporated into AASB 15). In addition, it noted that IPSAS 23 was issued prior to the issue of IFRS 15.\nThe requirements of IPSAS 23 were therefore not necessarily developed with reference to similar principles\nto IFRS 15. The Board concluded these IPSASB Standards do not provide an appropriate basis for financial\nreporting in the Australian environment, particularly because they require different income recognition\ndepending on whether the transaction is an exchange transaction or a non-exchange transaction, and\nIPSAS 9 and IPSAS 11 adopt a \u2018risks and rewards\u2019 approach that is not consistent with the performance\nobligation approach in IFRS 15.  \nBC72 The Board further noted the IPSASB is currently developing proposals for the accounting for non-exchange\nexpenses. The IPSASB is also developing a related project on revenue, which uses IFRS 15 as a starting\npoint and looks at the type of modifications that would be required for IFRS 15 to be suitable for\napplication to a wide range of revenue transactions in the public sector. This may result in revisions to, or a\nreplacement of, the existing IPSASB revenue recognition requirements. The IPSASB expects to complete\nthese projects in 2019. The Board noted that it would consider undertaking a project to review the guidance\nto AASB 15 following the completion of these projects.  \n-----  ",

However, as AASB 15 is generally expressed from the perspective of for-profit\nentities in the private sector, the Board received feedback that it is unclear whether the guidance in\nAASB 15 could be applied to account for revenue from licences issued by not-for-profit public sector\nlicensors, particularly in the case of non-IP licences and non-contractual licences arising from statutory\nrequirements.  \nBC4 When commencing this project the Board noted diversity in practice in relation to the accounting for\nrevenue from licences, in particular non-IP licences (eg casino and gaming licences). Later investigation\nindicated that whilst the qualitative number of licence transactions is significant, the quantitative impact is\nunlikely to be significant to the public sector.  \nBC5 The Board had previously considered the accounting for revenue from licences issued by not-for-profit\npublic sector licensors as part of its projects relating to:  \n(a) AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors (see paragraphs BC38\u2013BC39); and  \n(b) AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities (see paragraph BC40).  \nBC6 In both instances, the Board deferred its deliberations pending a specific project to research the extent to\nwhich these types of licences exist, as well as the current and potential accounting treatment.  \nBC7 Consequently, the Board decided to add to its 2017-2019 Work Program a project to clarify the accounting\nfor revenue from licences issued by not-for-profit public sector licensors. The Board decided the project\nshould address:  \n(a) the nature of the right created by a licence \u2013 whether the licence confers the right to use or access\na licensor\u2019s asset, or confers a right to perform an activity where there is no licensor asset\ninvolved, and whether different accounting treatments for revenue from such licences are\nappropriate;  \n(b) whether the scope of AASB 15 should be expanded to encompass non-contractual licences issued\nunder statute and/or non-IP licences; and  \n(c) whether the guidance in AASB 15 specifically for IP licences is appropriate for all licences issued\nby not-for-profit public sector entities.  \n-----  ",

In developing the proposals, the Board considered past research undertaken as part of its_\nAASB 1058 and AASB 1059 projects, as well as a number of public AASB meeting Agenda Papers that\nconsidered the application of existing accounting Standards (see paragraphs BC31\u2013BC52). ED 283\nproposed guidance that would clarify the application of AASB 15 to licences that did not fall within the\nscope of any other Australian Accounting Standard.  \nBC9 Between issuing ED 283 and finalising the Standard, the Board held targeted outreach with key\nstakeholders in the NFP public sector, including state and national treasuries, audit offices, accounting\nfirms, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), credit rating agencies, and representatives of the\nAustralasian Council of Public Accounts Committees (users of NFP public sector financial statements). The\nED proposals were also presented at various forums, workshops and discussion groups.  \nBC10 The Board received feedback on its proposals through receipt of 8 formal comment letters on ED 283. The\nBoard also obtained feedback via means such as email, meetings with constituents and feedback from\nexternal presentations. The responses to ED 283 indicated that:  \n(a) the majority of respondents agreed revenue from non-IP licences should be accounted for in\naccordance with the general principles of AASB 15 (but not the specific guidance provided for IP\nlicences). However, despite support in principle, numerous respondents raised concern with the\noutcome of applying the principles in AASB 15, in particular for high-value long-term licences\nsuch as casino licences (discussed further in BC84);  \n(b) some respondents sought clarification of the distinction between licences and taxes, and\nrecommended aligning the distinction between a licence and tax more closely with the definitions\nof the ABS\u2019s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Manual to allow for the harmonisation of the\ntwo frameworks; and  \n(c) some respondents raised concerns with the proposal to allocate the transaction wholly to a\npromise to issue a licence where the arrangement has a dual purpose of issuing a licence and\nimposing a tax. The respondents were especially concerned with the practical consequences when\nhaving to account for any variable consideration, noting that it is possible for an arrangement to\ndemonstrate both elements of licensing and taxation.  \nBC11 The Board considered these issues as well as a range of other issues identified by constituents in developing\nthis Standard following the ED 283 exposure process.  \nBC12 In May, June and August 2018, the Board considered issues papers and draft wording for paragraphs of the\nStandard which were published as Board agenda papers for the public. This gave constituents the\nopportunity to follow the debate and to provide comments on the issues and drafting contemporaneously.  \nBC13 In August 2018 the Board decided to finalise its decisions to address issues raised by constituent in the form\nof a Pre-Ballot Draft of the Standard. The Board felt it unnecessary to issue a fatal-flaw version of the\nStandard in light of the Board deciding not to make any major changes to the proposals in ED 283. Instead,\nthe Board decided that the final Standard would provide clarification and additional guidance and examples\nto assist NFP public sector licensors distinguish licences from taxes (and other arrangements within the\nscope of other Standards), and how the principles of AASB 15 would apply to non-IP licences.",

        "page_content=": "## AASB 1058 Income of Not-For-Profit Entities: distinguishing a licence from a tax  \nBC18 The Board noted that AASB 1058 defines and prescribes the accounting for taxes. Although AASB 1058\nuses the term \u2018licence\u2019, it is not defined, but the inference is that licences and taxes are different in nature.\nTherefore, the distinction between licences and taxes should, as a starting point, be drawn from the\nAASB 1058 definition of \u2018taxes\u2019, which is:  \nEconomic benefits compulsorily paid or payable to public sector entities in accordance with laws\nand/or regulations to provide income to the government. Taxes exclude fines.  \nBC19 The Board noted this definition of \u2018taxes\u2019 identifies two points of distinction, being:  \n(a) the notion of compulsion; and  \n(b) the purpose of the payment.  \nBC20 In relation to compulsion, the Board observed that, in contrast to a tax, although a licence fee may be\ncompulsorily payable upon issue, a prospective licensee has discretion over whether to seek a licence. For\nexample, an entity would generally have discretion over whether to perform an activity that requires a\nlicence, whereas a tax would arise generally from activities that are necessary for the entity to operate, for\nexample earning revenue. The Board also observed that the notion of compulsion could be supported by the\nconsequences of evading a licence fee or tax. For example, if an entity were found to have evaded a licence\nfee, it would not be compulsory for the entity to retrospectively obtain the licence. Any consequence for\nundertaking unlicensed activities would be in the nature of a fine or other penalty (ie the entity would not be\ncompelled to obtain a licence). In contrast, an entity found to have evaded a tax would be compelled to pay\nthe tax in addition to any fine or other penalty. The Board decided that, in distinguishing a licence from a\ntax, the notion of compulsion by reference to whether an entity would have discretion over whether to\nobtain a licence or not would be useful as a primary or singular point of distinction between a licence and\ntax.  \nBC21 In relation to the purpose of the payment, the definition of tax in AASB 1058 states that \u201ctaxes are\nestablished to provide income to the government\u201d. The Board considered whether licences could be\ndifferentiated such that the primary purpose of the arrangement would be non-financial, for example to\nregulate social behaviour, or to allocate a public resource equitably. In considering the usefulness of this\ndiscriminator, the Board acknowledged some licence arrangements could arguably have multiple purposes\n(ie both financial and non-financial), or could have a primarily financial purpose on an ongoing basis. The\nBoard noted that the relativity of the proceeds received and the costs incurred might be indicative that a tax\ncomponent exists. Consequently, the usefulness of the purpose of establishment as a distinguishing feature\nbetween a licence and tax could be of limited use if considered as a primary distinguishing feature or in\nisolation. Accordingly, the Board decided that although the purpose could be a useful feature to consider\ndependent on the specific facts and circumstances of an arrangement in conjunction with the other features,\nit should not be used as a primary or singular point of distinction between a licence and tax.  \n-----  ",

The Board noted the ABS GFS Manual defines the term\n\u2018licence\u2019 widely and infers that although a variety of arrangements could be referred to as licences, revenue\nfrom these arrangements could be taxes or administration fees depending on the level of work involved for\nthe issuing public sector entity. Additionally, the Board noted the ABS GFS Manual does not identify the\npurpose of establishment of an arrangement as a basis for distinguishing a licence from a tax, and adopts the\nlicensor\u2019s perspective in ascertaining the economic substance of the transaction. This approach is therefore\ninconsistent with the points of distinction implied by the definition of a tax in AASB 1058. Accordingly, the\nBoard decided the approach adopted by the ABS GFS Manual would not be useful as a primary or singular\npoint of distinction between a licence and tax, but may provide assistance when considering the purpose of\nthe payment.  \nBC25 Despite this, some respondents to ED 283 (including the ABS) preferred that the Board align with the\nABS\u2019s definition of a licence for distinguishing licences from taxes. However, the Board reaffirmed its\ndecision to not use proportionality of level of work to transaction price as a primary distinguishing feature\nas:  \n(a) the Board observed that determining whether the revenue recognised is proportionate to the cost\nof a licensor\u2019s obligations is a difficult and subjective assessment that, based on feedback from\npreparers, might not be applied consistently in the preparation of general purpose financial\nstatements;  \n(b) adopting the ABS GFS Manual approach could result in the majority of the arrangements in\nquestion being classified as a tax and accounted for in accordance with AASB 1058. AASB 1058\nparagraph B28 specifically precludes taxes from giving rise to a contract liability or revenue\nrecognised in accordance with AASB 15, as they do not promise to provide a good or service in\nan agreement that creates enforceable obligations. However, the Board noted that a proportion of\nthe arrangements that would be classified as a licence under the guidance in this Standard are\ndifferent in substance to taxes as:  \n(i) they do create direct rights for the licensee (most commonly a right to perform) and\nobligations for the licensor to provide a good or service (also, most commonly, a right\nto perform); and  \n(ii) the discretionary nature of licences indicates that the economic purpose of the\ntransaction is to obtain the goods and services (most commonly a right to perform)\nfrom the licensor, and therefore it would be counter intuitive to the Board\u2019s policy of\ntransaction neutrality to preclude a NFP public sector licensor from accounting for its\nrevenue when (or as) it transfers control of the good or service, consistent with forprofit entities providing goods or services.",

The asset would also need to be an\nidentified asset with no substantive right of substitution.  \n-----  BC33 The Board considered the meaning of \u2018right to use\u2019 in the context of the Application Guidance in AASB 16,\nwhich requires the contract to convey the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time.\nIn doing so, an entity is required to assess whether a customer has:  \n(a) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset,\nsuch that the customer has rights to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used; and  \n(b) the right to direct the use of the identified asset, such that relevant decisions about how and for\nwhat purpose the asset is used are predetermined. The customer must also have the right to\noperate the asset without the supplier having rights to change operating instructions, or the\ncustomer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will\nbe used.  \nBC34 Accordingly, the Board observed that AASB 16 could only apply to \u2018right to use\u2019 identified assets under\ncontractual licences outside the scope of AASB 15, but that the term \u2018right to use\u2019 in the context of\nAASB 16, as outlined in the Application Guidance of that Standard, is used in a different context to the\nterm \u2018right to use\u2019 when accounting for revenue from the issue of IP licences addressed in AASB 15.  \nBC35 In this regard, the Board noted that it would expect most non-IP licences issued by NFP public sector\nlicensors would not constitute \u2018right to use\u2019 identified asset type licences, and therefore would not fall\nwithin the scope of AASB 16 because:  \n(a) in most cases there would not be an underlying licensor\u2019s asset involved in the arrangement (for\nexample \u2018right to perform\u2019 type licences); or  \n(b) where a licensor\u2019s asset is involved, it would be in the nature of \u2018a capacity portion of an asset\nthat is not physically distinct\u2019 (a phrase used in AASB 16) and not an identified asset.  \nBC36 In this regard, the Board noted that although a licence could satisfy the definition of a lease and therefore\nfall within the scope of AASB 16, after consultation with constituents it could only identify a limited\nnumber of examples (eg spectrum licences).  \nBC37 The Board decided to amend the scope paragraph of AASB 16 to ensure the interaction of AASB 15 and 16\nis clear.",

The Board noted however that the _Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of_\n_Financial Statements (the Conceptual Framework) does not distinguish between rights and obligations_\ncreated by contract and those created by statute.  \nBC44 A key legal feature in distinguishing between rights and obligations created by contract versus those created\nunder a statute is the assessment of whether the parties entered into the arrangement voluntarily.\nArrangements imposed by statute (for example, taxation) are not contractual given that mutual voluntariness\nis lacking. However not all relationships prescribed by statute are this conclusive.

In doing so, the Board noted that paragraph 26(i) of\nAASB 15 includes, within the ambit of goods and services, the granting of licences. This position is further\nevidenced by the specific guidance in Appendix B of AASB 15 that applies to the accounting for revenue\nfrom IP licences in AASB 15. Therefore, the Board observed that the inclusion of IP licences in the scope\nof AASB 15 could suggest non-IP licences conferring rights to use or access a licensor\u2019s asset (and that is\nnot a lease) would also fall within the scope of AASB 15 (subject to the satisfaction of the other criteria\napplicable to assessing whether an arrangement is within the scope of AASB 15).  \nBC48 The Board also considered, in relation to a licence granting a right to perform an activity, whether the\nabsence of a right to an asset of the licensor could preclude the right to perform an activity from constituting\ngoods or services.

        "page_content=": "## Allocating a transaction between licences and taxes  \nBC53 In ED 283 the Board noted that a licensor could enter into a single transaction comprising of a licence and\nother economically different elements that are not contractually promised goods or services (such as a tax).\nIn allocating the transaction price between a licence and other components of the transaction, the Board\nconsidered whether the implementation guidance relating to the allocation of the transaction price to\nperformance obligations set out in Appendix F of AASB 15 [which arose from AASB 2016-8] should be\napplied.  \nBC54 Paragraphs F28\u2013F32 of Appendix F of AASB 15 set out implementation guidance for NFP entities in\nallocating a transaction price where NFP entities enter into transactions with a dual purpose of:  \n(a) obtaining goods or services, which, in the context of this Standard, could be a licence element\n(accounted for under AASB 15); and  \n(b) to help the NFP entity achieve its objectives, which, again in the context of this Standard, could\nbe a tax element (accounted for under AASB 1058).  \nBC55 Appendix F of AASB 15 requires the allocation be based on a rebuttable presumption that the transaction\nprice is treated as wholly related to the transfer of promised goods or service (in the context of this\nStandard, the licence), where the rebuttal is premised on the arrangement being partially refundable in the\nevent the entity does not deliver the promised goods or services (most commonly, a right to perform).  \nBC56 The Board noted the views that:  \n(a) if the price of a licence far exceeds the cost of the level of work required to satisfy the\nperformance obligation, consistent with GFS accounting for licences (see paragraph BC24\nabove), the \u2018excess\u2019 over a reasonable price for the performance obligation may be a tax in\ncertain circumstances; and  \n(b) if an arrangement contains variable consideration (eg a sales-based or usage-based royalty to\nprovide the licensor with additional revenue where the licensee makes a \u2018super-profit\u2019), this\ncomponent of the transaction price may be considered to be a tax in certain circumstances.  \nBC57 The Board considered whether the GFS approach of accounting allocation between licence and tax revenue\nshould be adopted (as previously discussed in paragraph BC25), and concluded that the guidance in\nparagraphs F28\u2013F32 of Appendix F of AASB 15 is more appropriate . The Board decided that\ndistinguishing between a tax element, based on excess over a \u2018reasonable price\u2019 for the licence operating\ncosts, would be too subjective (consistent with the Board\u2019s decision to not use the GFS definition of a\nlicence also noted in paragraph BC25).  \nBC58 Accordingly, the Board decided that a transaction price should only be allocated between a licence and a tax\nwhen the rebuttable presumption in paragraph F29 of Appendix F is met, and the licence fee is partially\nrefundable in the event that the licence conditions are not satisfied, indicative that there is an element that is\na tax component as it is not refundable. In that instance the licensor should apply the guidance in paragraphs\nF28\u2013F32 to disaggregate the transaction price and account for the component that relates to the transfer of a\nlicence in accordance with AASB 15 (and any additional guidance contained in this Standard). The\nremainder of the transaction price, being the non-refundable component, is accounted for in accordance\nwith AASB 1058.  \nBC59 The Board considered whether variable consideration should be considered as a circumstance rebutting the\npresumption that the transaction price should not be allocated. The Board noted that AASB 15 provides\nspecific guidance for variable consideration for IP licences and accordingly considered there to be no  \n-----  difference in economic substance between a public sector entity or private sector entity undertaking such\narrangement as part of a licence arrangement that would warrant a different accounting treatment.\nTherefore, a licence fee that includes variable consideration is part of revenue earned from issuing the\nlicence and not a tax.  \nBC60 Respondents to ED 283 agreed with the Board\u2019s proposal to utilise the rebuttable presumption in\nAppendix F of AASB 15, however some raised concerns that the proposals did not always allow for the\nallocation between a licence and a tax where there is variable consideration. The Board was made aware of\ntwo scenarios where respondents believed that the variable component was not a sales-based or usage-based\nroyalty, but instead a tax that should be eligible for disaggregation:  \n(a) the variable amount is levied on the licensee under a separate agreement that is signed\nconcurrently with the licencing agreement and hence is labelled as a separate tax, rather than\nvariable consideration for the licencing arrangement. In the example provided, the rate at which\nthe licensee is \u2018taxed\u2019 is agreed between the licensor and licensee and is negotiated on a licenceby-licence basis, rather than being imposed as a state-wide or national taxation regime (ie it is an\nindividually negotiated rate rather than a single rate applied to all parties entering into such\narrangements within a certain jurisdiction); and  \n(b) the variable fee for the licence is a generic tax charged to any entity undertaking similar activities,\nregardless of whether that entity holds a licence or not. In the example given, the licensee was\nrequired to pay a specified fee (eg 10 per cent) on the proceeds from its betting activities that it\nwas licensed to conduct in its gaming venue. However, this same 10 per cent fee was also payable\nas a tax for entities that undertook equivalent betting activities for which it was unnecessary for\nthe entity to be licensed (for example, an online betting agency that does not require a licence to\nopen a gaming venue).  \nBC61 In the scenario noted in paragraph BC60(a), the Board noted that in accordance with the requirements in\nparagraph 17 of AASB 15, although there may be two agreements entered into by the licensor with the\nlicensee (one for the licence and another labelled as \u2018tax\u2019), these agreements should be combined and\nconsidered as one \u2018contract\u2019 or arrangement (ie licencing arrangement) if they are entered into at or near the\nsame time with the same customer and negotiated as a package with a single commercial (or regulatory)\nobjective.  \nBC62 However, in the scenario noted in paragraph BC60(b), the Board observed there was an identifiable element\nthat is a tax that can be readily separated. Noting that the rebuttable presumption is intended to make the\naccounting simpler for preparers (reducing the burden of determining how to split the elements of the\ntransaction), the Board decided that where there is a readily identifiable generic tax element, it would not be\nonerous for an entity to disaggregate it. To give effect to this decision, the Board added an additional\ncircumstance rebutting the presumption that the transaction price should not be allocated in paragraph G5(b)\nwhen there is other evidence supporting similar transactions effected through different structures are taxed.",

        "page_content=": "## Applying specific guidance for IP licences in AASB 15 to various examples of licences  \nBC65 In ED 283 the Board considered whether the specific guidance for private sector IP licences in paragraphs\nB52\u2013B63B of AASB 15 could be easily applied by analogy to examples of non-IP licences (that both  \n-----  involve a licensor\u2019s assets and that involve a right to perform an activity). The Board noted that application\nof those paragraphs to IP licences appears relatively straight-forward because IP licences issued by NFP\npublic sector licensors appear to align with those IP licences issued by for-profit entities. However, in\nrelation to non-IP licences, the Board observed application of many of the requirements was more\nchallenging. Challenges were particularly notable where the licence did not involve an asset of the licensor.\nIn particular:  \n(a) many of the requirements (eg AASB 15 paragraphs B58\u2013B59A, which are used to determine\nwhether an IP licence transfers over time) require an assessment of whether the licensor\u2019s\nactivities significantly affect the IP (ie the underlying asset); and  \n(b) in the case of some NFP public sector non-IP licences, the licensor may conduct a number of\nactions throughout the licence period, such as monitoring licensees and their activities under their\nlicences. However, the actions are performed more generally in the public interest. It is not clear\nwhether these activities are undertaken to significantly affect the licensee\u2019s rights granted by the\nlicence. The specific guidance in Appendix B of AASB 15 for IP licences does not explicitly\naddress this matter as it is not written from a NFP public sector perspective.  \nBC66 Despite the guidance for IP licences appearing easier to apply to licences involving assets of the licensor\nthat are not leases, the Board was unable to identify licences of this type. This is because, in most cases,\nnon-IP licences that involve an asset of the licensor (but are not leases) are not distinct from other goods or\nservices that the entity provides (ie in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs 26\u201330 and paragraph\nB54 of AASB 15). Accordingly these types of arrangements would be accounted for as a bundle of goods or\nservices in accordance with paragraph 30.  \nBC67 For example, the Board considered the following two examples of licensing arrangements involving an\nasset of the licensor that are not leases.",

In these examples, the bodies of water and the fish are arguably\nassets of the licensor, which the licensee has the right to access or use.  \nBC70 In these examples, the licensee has the ability to take or attempt to take abalone/fish (up to a maximum\nquota in the case of abalone). However, when examined, the Board concluded that abalone/fish are tangible\ngoods and the licence is an inextricable part of those tangible goods and is therefore not distinct (refer\nparagraphs 26\u201330). Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 30, the licence is combined with the other\ngoods or services and accounted for as a bundle of goods or services that is a single performance obligation  \nBC71 The Board also observed that despite an arrangement being referred to as a licence, it might be in substance\na \u2018take or pay\u2019 arrangement, and should be accounted for in accordance with the principles of AASB 15,\nwith consideration of paragraphs B44\u2013B47, which address customers\u2019 unexercised rights. An example of\nthis would be where a NFP public sector licensor issues a \u2018licence\u2019 that requires the licensee to pay for a\nspecified quota of a good, regardless of whether or not the licensee subsequently chooses or manages to\ntake the specified quota.  \nBC72 The Board asked a specific question in ED 283 to understand whether there were any examples of distinct\nnon-IP licences involving an asset of the licensor. Respondents to ED 283 noted a small number, such as\nmooring licences and road occupancy licences, however the Board noted that the licences identified are not  \n-----  common examples, and would not represent a significant amount of an NFP public sector entity\u2019s overall\nrevenue from licences. The Board therefore decided that Standard-setting activities were not warranted, and\nthat if a NFP public sector entity did happen to have a material amount of revenue from these licences, the\nguidance for non-IP licences involving a right to perform would be sufficient.",

The primary  \n2 As a further practical expedient, rather than requiring the licensor to apply paragraphs 39\u201345 of AASB 15 to select an appropriate  \nmethod to measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of its performance obligation under the licence, revenue could be\nrecognised using a systematic basis over the licencing period (eg on a straight-line basis).  \n-----  reason for the decision is that option 2 is comparatively easier to apply than option 1 (especially for non-IP\nlicences) and option 4 and it is the most consistent with a transaction neutral approach.

However, despite support in principle, respondents\nnoted that some activities that extend beyond just administrative activities, including maintaining\nexclusivity of the licence, periodically monitoring whether the terms of a licence are being met and\nupholding the integrity of the licence are not just features of a licence, but are in fact performance\nobligations that enhance the commerciality of the arrangements.

The Board considered that some non-IP licences might be structured such that\nthe licensor has the right to change the rights issued in the licence at any time (ie change the right to\nperform at any time), which may indicate that the licensee does not control the same licence over the term\nof the licence, and hence control is transferred over time.

        "page_content=": "## Providing a rule to recognise revenue over time  \nBC92 In progressing ED 283, the Board also gave consideration as to whether it should provide a specific rule for\nall licences to be recognised over time (ie revisiting option 3 from paragraph BC73).  \nBC93 Based on the analysis in paragraphs BC87\u2013BC89, the Board decided that exclusivity and monitoring\nactivities do not represent a performance obligation in accordance with AASB 15. Therefore, the Board\nobserved that if it were to address comments from constituents that such activities should represent a  \n-----  performance obligation (and hence be satisfied over time), the Board would need to create a rule divergent\nfrom the principles of AASB 15.  \nBC94 The Board noted that in AASB 1059, under the \u2018grant of a right to the operator\u2019 (GORTO) model, the\nlicensor is effectively licencing the operator to use the service concession asset. The Board noted its\nconsideration of applying the IP licensing guidance in AASB 15 to account for these arrangements in the\nscope of AASB 1059, but instead decided to require revenue to be recognised over time under the GORTO\nmethod. The Board also observed that a licensor is required to perform certain monitoring activities in a\nservice concession arrangement, such as identifying non-paying vehicles and in the collections of nonpayment toll fares.  \nBC95 The Board considered whether this set a precedent to provide a rule for non-IP licences to be recognised\nover time. However, the Board noted fundamental differences between service concession arrangements\nand non-IP licences. A service concession arrangement provides an operator with a right to access an asset\nthat is controlled by the public sector. A licence is a right to use IP or non-IP that is not captured by AASB\n16, or a right to perform, which provides significantly more control of the asset or the right to perform to the\nlicensee, than is provided in a service concession arrangement. In a service concession arrangement, the\npublic sector grantor capitalises an asset as part of the arrangement as it is considered a financing\ntransaction in substance, and not a licence. The Board considered that recognising revenue immediately\n(rather than a liability) on the recognition of a service concession asset at fair value being current\nreplacement cost did not reflect the economic substance of the arrangement and would overstate current\nyear financial performance and the financial position when the right to charge users of the asset has been\ntransferred to the operator, as current replacement cost would not reflect that the future cash flows\nattributable to the asset had been given up by the grantor. This would not be the case for licensing\narrangements as the licensor would not, in most cases, be recognising the asset giving rise to the licence in\nits financial statements. Accordingly, the Board does not consider it appropriate to analogise to service\nconcession arrangements when considering the treatment of licences.  \nBC96 On balance, the Board decided that AASB 1059 had not set a precedent for a rule for licences, as revenue is\nrecognised over time for reasons specific to service concession arrangements. The Board also noted that the\nmajority of non-IP licences would be addressed by the practical expedients for short-term and low-value\nlicences. Further, the Board noted that the disagreement with the application of AASB 15 (noted in\nparagraph BC84) related primarily to casino and gaming licences. The Board observed that the prevalence\nand magnitude of such types of licences did not require specific treatment, in accordance with _The AASB\u2019s_\n_Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework. The Board made this assessment at the jurisdictional_\nlevel, observing that casino and gaming licences typically are issued by treasuries or departments of\nfinance, with administering agencies accounting for such licences as administered items. In light of this the\nBoard decided that the underlying principles of AASB 15 are appropriate for the recognition of revenue\nfrom non-IP licences, and it did not find a justifiable reason to diverge from its policy on transaction\nneutrality.",

The Board noted this guidance might make it easier for licensors to determine the\ntransaction price and timing of revenue recognition of non-IP licensing arrangements involving sales-based\nor usage-based consideration. However, in ED 283, the Board decided to use the general guidance in\nAASB 15 to be consistent with the overall decision as part of option 2 (see the table in paragraph BC73\nabove). The Board also decided to ask constituents a specific question within ED 283 on whether AASB 15\nparagraph B63 should be used instead of the general guidance in AASB 15 to account for sales-based or\nusage-based consideration for non-IP licences.  \nBC98 Feedback from respondents on this question was mixed. A number of respondents supported the Board\ntaking a transaction neutral approach to accounting for variable consideration (ie applying the general\nrequirements in AASB 15). However many of these respondents also noted they did not issue licences that\ninvolved variable consideration. In contrast, some respondents that do issue licences with variable\nconsideration noted the practical difficulties in applying the general requirements in AASB 15 (such as\nestimating the consideration and the significant adjustments that would be required) and therefore preferred\napplying the specific requirements in paragraphs B63\u2013B63B for variable consideration of IP licences.  \nBC99 However, the Board observed that difficulties in estimating variable consideration was only brought to the\nBoard\u2019s attention in the context of long-term licences, such as casino licences. As noted in paragraph BC4,\nthe Board observed that the quantitative magnitude of this type of licence is not of significant materiality.\nAdditionally, outreach with users of NFP public sector financial statements confirmed that the variable\ncomponent of these types of licences is not material to their decision-making.  \n-----  BC100 On balance, the Board decided that it was not justifiable (given user needs were addressed), nor sufficiently\nsignificant (given the quantitative magnitude) to warrant departure from its policy of transaction neutrality,\nand reaffirmed its decision to require variable consideration in non-IP licences to be accounted for in\naccordance with the general principles of AASB 15.",

As noted in paragraphs BC24 and BC25, the key difference between GAAP and GFS\nthat may arise is where the cost of administrative activities related to the issue of a licence is clearly out of\nproportion to the revenue, the revenue would be classified as a tax (under GFS) instead of a licence (under\nGAAP). Therefore, where the cost to issue the licence is proportionate to the expenditure of the licensor, the\nlicence would be classified as a licence, which is ultimately described as sales of goods and services under\nGFS. The Board noted (based on advice in the ABS\u2019s comments on ED 283) licences that might be subject\nto different classification would include casino and taxi licences, for which the timing of income\nrecognition under GFS and GAAP would likely be aligned.  \nBC103 The Board considered its policy on GAAP/GFS harmonisation. Consistent with the rationale provided in\nparagraph BC25, and consistent with AASB 1058, the Board considered that it was not appropriate to\namend its decisions reflected in this Standard in order to achieve full GAAP/GFS harmonisation. The Board\nalso noted that the key difference is caused by a difference in the Board\u2019s view of a tax (and the definition\nof a tax in AASB 1058), and the underlying principles to distinguish licences from taxes in the GFS\nManual. Further, some differences could only be addressed by making changes to the underlying principles\nin AASB 1058 and AASB 15. The Board noted that AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General_\n_Government Sector Financial Reporting requires entities to identify and explain any differences arising_\nfrom different requirements in GAAP as compared to GFS.  \n-----  ",

Accordingly, the\nBoard made changes to Illustrative Examples 4A and 4B by removing the references to re-performance and\nparagraph B4 in assessing the application of paragraph 35(a), and adding an explanation in Illustrative\nExample 4B on why in this example it is clear that there is no simultaneous receipt and consumption by the\ndonor of the benefits of the institute\u2019s performance of the research activities.  \nBC5 The Board noted that some stakeholders did not find the Illustrative Examples useful and were concerned\nthat the fact patterns did not reflect common features of most research agreements. The Board decided to\ninclude an additional example to illustrate other key contract features.

Significant judgement is required in applying\nthe Standards and the sector has a large volume of tailored or non-standard contracts to assess. Many\nstakeholders in the university sector and medical research sector have December year-ends. With limited\ntime left for the sector to tackle the significant implementation challenges and uncertainty as to the\nrequirements to be applied, permitting not-for-profit entities to apply the Standards to research grants from\nperiods beginning on or after 1 July 2019 rather than 1 January 2019 will provide the sector with additional\nimplementation time and will not affect preparers with June year-ends. The extended implementation period\nwould also give the Board an opportunity to provide further educative materials to assist with\nimplementation.  \nBC8 The extended implementation period for research grants applies to the accounting for both income relating\nto research grants (including revenue) and contract costs relating to research grants. Not-for-profit entities\ncan elect whether to apply AASB 15 and AASB 1058 to all research grants, or to apply the previously\napplicable Standards to them, until periods beginning on or after 1 July 2019, when AASB 15 and AASB\n1058 will have to be applied. The Board considered whether to define \u2018research grants\u2019 and decided that it\nwould not be feasible to clearly define the term, but noted the numerous examples of research grants\nprovided in the Illustrative Examples accompanying AASB 15. The Board noted the exemption does not\napply on an individual research grant basis as such an exemption would significantly impair the consistency\nand comparability of an entity\u2019s results.  \nBC9 The Board considered whether to defer the application of AASB 15 and AASB 1058 in their entirety for all\nnot-for-profit entities. However, the Board noted that such an approach would have implications for\nAASB 16, as AASB 16 includes references to AASB 15. For example, AASB 16 requires an entity to\nassess whether a transfer of an asset in a sale and leaseback transaction is a sale under AASB 15 (ie when a\nperformance obligation is satisfied). The Board decided that the better approach was to permit delayed\nimplementation of the Standard for research grants, being the area of most concern in applying the\nStandard.  \n-----  ",

Where the not-for-profit entity recognised revenue within the scope of AASB 15 and  \n-----  a non-refundable upfront payment is charged to the customer, AASB 15 paragraphs 22\u201330, B48\u2013B51 and\nF20\u2013F27 require an entity to assess whether the upfront fees relate to the transfer of a promised good or\nservice. If the upfront fees do relate to a transfer of goods or services, revenue is recognised over the time\nthe service or goods are provided rather than on receipt of the funds.  \nBC11 Stakeholders raised this issue from the perspective of diversity in practice, where some entities are deferring  \nrevenue (and recognising a contract liability in accordance with AASB 15) and other entities are continuing\nto recognise revenue on receipt of fees which, prima facie, look very similar. Stakeholders also indicated\nthat the principle of deferral is confusing to boards, management committees, members and other users as\nthe amounts received are not refundable. Stakeholders requested further guidance to clarify the principle\nand why a contract liability is recognised when the funds will never be repaid.  \nBC12 The Board considered the stakeholder comments and assessed the feedback with reference to the AASB Not\n_for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework.

This\nuncertainty exists because it is unclear whether the Board would be likely to require retrospective\napplication of the initial fair value requirement if it decides in the future to remove the accounting policy\nchoice to initially measure such right-of-use assets at cost. Stakeholders commented that if retrospective\napplication was required, the collection of fair value information for historical concessionary leases,\nparticularly those leases that have been in place for a significant period, would be costly and time\nconsuming. At its November 2021 meeting, the Board discussed the initial measurement requirements for\nconcessionary right-of-use assets with a view to providing certainty to not-for-profit private sector lessees.  \nBC15 The Board acknowledged that, conceptually, requiring right-of use assets arising under concessionary leases  \nto be initially measured at fair value is consistent with the accounting treatment applied to other assets\nacquired on below-market terms and conditions and better reflects the value of the right-of-use asset\nobtained by the lessee in its financial position and financial performance.

This is because:  \n(a) many not-for-profit private sector entities may not have the knowledge and experience in\napplying the principles of AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement because they generally do not_\nmeasure non-financial assets at fair value. The cost and effort required to understand and apply\nAASB 13 requirements for the one-off purpose of initially recognising a right-of-use asset under\na concessionary lease might be considered unjustified;  \n(b) some stakeholders have commented that the disclosures required by AASB 16, including the\nrequirements in AASB 16 paragraphs Aus59.1\u2500Aus59.2, appear to provide sufficient information\nto users of financial statements about concessionary leases for them to understand the effects of\nthe leases on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity, in the\nabsence of fair value information; and  \n-----  (c) some stakeholders have commented that recognising income resulting from initially measuring\nsuch right-of-use assets at fair value, and the subsequent amortisation of the right-of-use assets,\nmight not meet the information needs of users of financial statements. This might particularly be\nthe case when a user is more interested in the entity\u2019s expenses that need to be funded rather than\nthe value of an asset consumed during the financial period that would not need to be funded.  \nBC16 Therefore, having regard to the AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework, the Board decided  \nto propose retaining the accounting policy choice in AASB 16 paragraphs Aus25.1\u2013Aus25.2 on an ongoing\nbasis (ie with no plan to reconsider the accounting policy choice) for not-for-profit private sector lessees to\nelect to initially measure a class of concessionary right-of-use assets at cost or fair value.",
