It is\ncommon for an area of interest to contract in size progressively, as exploration and evaluation\nlead towards the identification of a mineral deposit or an oil or natural gas field, which may prove\nto contain economically recoverable reserves. When this happens during the exploration for and\nevaluation of mineral resources, exploration and evaluation expenditures are still included in the\ncost of the exploration and evaluation asset notwithstanding that the size of the area of interest\nmay contract as the exploration and evaluation operations progress.

In making this determination, an entity considers\nthe degree to which the expenditure can be associated with finding specific mineral resources. The  \n-----  following are examples of expenditures that might be included in the initial measurement of exploration and\nevaluation assets (the list is not exhaustive):  \n(a) acquisition of rights to explore;  \n(b) topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies;  \n(c) exploratory drilling;  \n(d) trenching;  \n(e) sampling; and  \n(f) activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a\nmineral resource.  \nAus9.1 In accordance with paragraph 9, where an entity recognises exploration and evaluation assets,\ndirect and indirect costs associated with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\nand which specifically relate to an area of interest are allocated to that area of interest. In making\nthis allocation, no distinction is drawn between costs incurred within the entity and the cost of\nservices performed by outside contractors or consultants on behalf of the entity.  \nAus9.2 The costs of acquiring leases or other rights of tenure in the area of interest are included in the\ncost of the exploration and evaluation asset if they are acquired as part of the exploration for and\nevaluation of mineral resources.  \nAus9.3 Indirect costs that are included in the cost of an exploration and evaluation asset include, among\nother things, charges for depreciation of equipment used in exploration and evaluation activities.  \nAus9.4 General and administrative costs are allocated to, and included in, the cost of an exploration and\nevaluation asset, but only to the extent that those costs can be related directly to operational\nactivities in the area of interest to which the exploration and evaluation asset relates. In all other\ncases, these costs are expensed as incurred. For example, general and administrative costs such as\ndirectors\u2019 fees, secretarial and share registry expenses, and salaries and other expenses of general\nmanagement are recognised as expenses when incurred since they are only indirectly related to\noperational activities.  \n10 Expenditures related to the development of mineral resources shall not be recognised as exploration and\nevaluation assets. The _Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048_\n_Interpretation of Standards) and AASB 138 Intangible Assets provide guidance on the recognition of assets_\narising from development.  \nAusCF10 Notwithstanding paragraph 10, in respect of AusCF entities, expenditures related to the\ndevelopment of mineral resources shall not be recognised as exploration and evaluation assets.\nThe _Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (as identified in_\nAASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards) and AASB 138 Intangible Assets provide guidance on\nthe recognition of assets arising from development.  \n11 In accordance with AASB 137 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets an entity_\nrecognises any obligations for removal and restoration that are incurred during a particular period as a\nconsequence of having undertaken the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources.",
