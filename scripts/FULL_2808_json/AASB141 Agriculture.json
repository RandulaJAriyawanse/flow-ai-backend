However, this Standard applies to\nthe produce on those bearer plants.  \n(c) government grants related to bearer plants (see AASB 120 _Accounting for Government Grants_\n_and Disclosure of Government Assistance)._  \n(d) intangible assets related to agricultural activity (see AASB 138 Intangible Assets).  \n(e) right-of-use assets arising from a lease of land related to agricultural activity (see AASB 16\n_Leases)._  \n3 This Standard is applied to agricultural produce, which is the harvested produce of the entity\u2019s biological\nassets, at the point of harvest. Thereafter, AASB 102 Inventories or another applicable Standard is applied.\nAccordingly, this Standard does not deal with the processing of agricultural produce after harvest; for\nexample, the processing of grapes into wine by a vintner who has grown the grapes. While such processing\nmay be a logical and natural extension of agricultural activity, and the events taking place may bear some\nsimilarity to biological transformation, such processing is not included within the definition of agricultural\nactivity in this Standard.  \n4 The table below provides examples of biological assets, agricultural produce, and products that are the\nresult of processing after harvest:  \n|Biological assets|Agricultural produce|Products that are the result of processing after harvest|\n|---|---|---|\n|Sheep|Wool|Yarn, carpet|\n|Trees in a timber plantation|Felled trees|Logs, lumber|\n|Dairy cattle|Milk|Cheese|  \n-----  |Biological assets|Agricultural produce|Products that are the result of processing after harvest|\n|---|---|---|\n|Pigs|Carcass|Sausages, cured hams|\n|Cotton plants|Harvested cotton|Thread, clothing|\n|Sugarcane|Harvested cane|Sugar|\n|Tobacco plants|Picked leaves|Cured tobacco|\n|Tea bushes|Picked leaves|Tea|\n|Grape vines|Picked grapes|Wine|\n|Fruit trees|Picked fruit|Processed fruit|\n|Oil palms|Picked fruit|Palm oil|\n|Rubber trees|Harvested latex|Rubber products|\n|Some plants, for example, tea bushes, grape vines, oil palms and rubber trees, usually meet the definition of a bearer plant and are within the scope of AASB 116. However, the produce growing on bearer plants, for example, tea leaves, grapes, oil palm fruit and latex, is within the scope of AASB 141.|||",

Certain common features exist within this diversity:  \n(a) _Capability to change. Living animals and plants are capable of biological transformation;_  \n(b) _Management of change. Management facilitates biological transformation by enhancing, or at_\nleast stabilising, conditions necessary for the process to take place (for example, nutrient levels,\nmoisture, temperature, fertility, and light).

For example, an entity may disclose the carrying amounts of consumable biological assets and\nbearer biological assets by group. An entity may further divide those carrying amounts between mature and\nimmature assets. These distinctions provide information that may be helpful in assessing the timing of\nfuture cash flows. An entity discloses the basis for making any such distinctions.  \n44 Consumable biological assets are those that are to be harvested as agricultural produce or sold as biological\nassets. Examples of consumable biological assets are livestock intended for the production of meat,\nlivestock held for sale, fish in farms, crops such as maize and wheat, produce on a bearer plant and trees\nbeing grown for lumber. Bearer biological assets are those other than consumable biological assets; for\nexample, livestock from which milk is produced and fruit trees from which fruit is harvested. Bearer\nbiological assets are not agricultural produce but, rather, are held to bear produce.  \n45 Biological assets may be classified either as mature biological assets or immature biological assets. Mature\nbiological assets are those that have attained harvestable specifications (for consumable biological assets) or\nare able to sustain regular harvests (for bearer biological assets).  \n**46** **If not disclosed elsewhere in information published with the financial statements, an entity shall**\n**describe:**  \n**(a)** **the nature of its activities involving each group of biological assets; and**  \n**(b)** **non-financial measures or estimates of the physical quantities of:**  \n**(i)** **each group of the entity\u2019s biological assets at the end of the period; and**  \n-----  **(ii)** **output of agricultural produce during the period.**  \n47\u2013\n48 [Deleted]  \n**49** **An entity shall disclose:**  \n**(a)** **the existence and carrying amounts of biological assets whose title is restricted, and the**\n**carrying amounts of biological assets pledged as security for liabilities;**  \n**(b)** **the amount of commitments for the development or acquisition of biological assets; and**  \n**(c)** **financial risk management strategies related to agricultural activity.**  \n**50** **An entity shall present a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of biological assets between**\n**the beginning and the end of the current period. The reconciliation shall include:**  \n**(a)** **the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value less costs to sell;**  \n**(b)** **increases due to purchases;**  \n**(c)** **decreases attributable to sales and biological assets classified as held for sale (or included in**\n**a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with AASB 5;**  \n**(d)** **decreases due to harvest;**  \n**(e)** **increases resulting from business combinations;**  \n**(f)** **net exchange differences** **arising on the translation of financial statements** **into a different**\n**presentation currency, and on the translation of a foreign operation into the presentation**\n**currency of the reporting entity; and**  \n**(g)** **other changes.**  \n51 The fair value less costs to sell of a biological asset can change due to both physical changes and price\nchanges in the market. Separate disclosure of physical and price changes is useful in appraising current\nperiod performance and future prospects, particularly when there is a production cycle of more than one\nyear. In such cases, an entity is encouraged to disclose, by group or otherwise, the amount of change in fair\nvalue less costs to sell included in profit or loss due to physical changes and due to price changes. This\ninformation is generally less useful when the production cycle is less than one year (for example, when\nraising chickens or growing cereal crops).  \n52 Biological transformation results in a number of types of physical change\u2014growth, degeneration,\nproduction, and procreation, each of which is observable and measurable. Each of those physical changes\nhas a direct relationship to future economic benefits. A change in fair value of a biological asset due to\nharvesting is also a physical change.  \n53 Agricultural activity is often exposed to climatic, disease and other natural risks. If an event occurs that\ngives rise to a material item of income or expense, the nature and amount of that item are disclosed in\naccordance with AASB 101 _Presentation of Financial Statements. Examples of such an event include an_\noutbreak of a virulent disease, a flood, a severe drought or frost, and a plague of insects.",
