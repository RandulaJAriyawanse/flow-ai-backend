However, public sector entities that\ncomply with AASB 1059 may not be in compliance with IPSAS 32 because of differences between the Standards.\nThe more significant differences include the following:  \n(a) AASB 1059 applies to public sector entities in both the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, whereas\nIPSAS 32 applies only to not-for-profit public sector entities;  \n(b) AASB 1059 requires the grantor to initially measure a service concession asset provided by the operator at\ncurrent replacement cost in accordance with the cost approach to fair value in AASB 13 _Fair Value_\n_Measurement. IPSAS 32 specifies measurement at fair value generally;_  \n(c) an existing asset of the grantor, including a previously unrecognised identifiable intangible asset or land\nunder roads, that is reclassified as a service concession asset is measured at fair value (current replacement\ncost) at the date of reclassification under AASB 1059. IPSAS 32 does not permit such remeasurement or the\nrecognition of previously unrecognised identifiable intangible assets or land under roads;  \n(d) AASB 1059 requires the grantor to recognise a financial liability where the grantor has a contractual\nobligation to pay cash to the operator for third-party usage of a service concession asset, with or without\nguaranteeing a minimum amount to the operator. IPSAS 32 refers to such an arrangement as a \u2018shadow toll\u2019\narrangement and requires the grantor to account for the payments as an expense when paid instead of\nrecognising a financial liability at the commencement of the arrangement;  \n(e) AASB 1059 provides more guidance on the term \u2018public service\u2019 than IPSAS 32; and  \n(f) IPSAS 32 includes additional application guidance for other revenues. Other revenues relate to\ncompensation by the operator to the grantor for access to the service concession asset by providing the\ngrantor with a series of predetermined inflows of resources such as an upfront payment or a stream of\npayments (eg rent payments) and revenue-sharing provisions.",

        "page_content=": "## AASB 1059 and IFRS Standards  \nPublic sector entities, including for-profit entities, that comply with AASB 1059 may not be in compliance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The\nIASB has issued an IFRIC Interpretation addressing the accounting by private sector operators of service concession\narrangements but has not issued a pronouncement regarding the accounting by grantors.  \nAASB 1059 requires a grantor to initially measure a service concession asset at current replacement cost in\naccordance with the cost approach to fair value in AASB 13. However, AASB 13 and the corresponding IFRS 13 Fair\n_Value Measurement do not specify which valuation technique to use. Instead IFRS 13 requires the use of valuation_\ntechniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value,\nmaximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. Three widely used\nvaluation techniques set out in IFRS 13 are the market approach, the cost approach and the income approach. The\nrequirement of AASB 1059 to initially measure a service concession asset at current replacement cost in accordance\nwith the cost approach may not be compliant with IFRS 13.  \nAASB 1059 requires a grantor to recognise an identifiable intangible asset as a service concession asset where the\ngrantor controls the asset as set out in paragraph 5 or 6, even if the asset does not qualify for recognition under\nAASB 138/IAS 38 Intangible Assets. This Standard also permits revaluation of the asset in the absence of an active\nmarket.  \nAASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires a licensor of intellectual property to recognise revenue_\nfrom granting the licence using either the right-to-use or right-to-access methods, depending on the specific facts and\ncircumstances. The general requirement in AASB 1059 to recognise revenue from granting a right to the operator over\nthe term of the service concession arrangement on an appropriate basis may not be compliant with IFRS 15 Revenue\n_from Contracts with Customers._  \nConsequently, a public sector grantor that is a for-profit entity may not be able to state that its financial statements\ncomply with IFRS Standards.  \n-----  ",

For example, the principles for recognition of a\nservice concession asset are broadly consistent with AASB Interpretation 12. However, because this\nStandard deals with the accounting by the public sector grantor, this Standard addresses the issues identified\nin AASB Interpretation 12 from the grantor\u2019s point of view, as follows:  \n(a) the grantor recognises a financial liability when it is obliged to make a payment or series of\npayments to the operator for provision of a service concession asset (ie constructed, developed,\nacquired or upgraded). Under paragraphs 12, 14 and 20 of AASB Interpretation 12, the operator\nrecognises revenue for the construction, development, acquisition, upgrade and operation services\nit provides. Under paragraph 16 of AASB Interpretation 12, the operator recognises a financial\nasset;  \n(b) the grantor recognises a liability when it grants the operator the right to earn revenue from thirdparty users of the service concession asset or another revenue-generating asset. Under\nparagraph 17 of AASB Interpretation 12, the operator recognises an intangible asset; and  \n(c) the grantor derecognises an asset it grants to the operator and over which it no longer has control\nand reduces the liability recognised under paragraph 11 of this Standard. Under paragraph 27 of\nAASB Interpretation 12, the operator accounts for the asset as part of the transaction price if the\nasset forms part of the consideration payable by the grantor for the services.  \nB2 Paragraph 2 of this Standard specifies that an arrangement within the scope of this Standard involves an\noperator providing a public service related to a service concession asset on behalf of a grantor. In many\njurisdictions, governments have introduced contractual service arrangements to attract private sector\nparticipation in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure and other assets\nused to provide public services. The assets may already exist, or may be constructed or upgraded during the\nperiod of the service arrangement. An arrangement within the scope of this Standard typically involves an\noperator constructing the assets used to provide the public services or upgrading the assets (for example, by\nincreasing their capacity) and operating and maintaining the assets for a specified period of time. Such\narrangements are often described as build-operate-transfer or rehabilitate-operate-transfer service\nconcession arrangements or public-private partnerships (PPPs).  \nB3 Paragraph 3 of the Standard illustrates the types of arrangements that are outside the scope of this Standard,\nsuch as arrangements that do not deliver a public service (for example, assets used for commercial\npurposes), arrangements where the operator does not provide and manage at least some of the public\nservices under its own discretion (for example, outsourcing service agreements where the public sector\nentity has control of the asset) and arrangements that involve service and management components where\nthe asset is not controlled by the grantor (for example, privatised assets that are subject to price regulation).",

A feature of a service concession arrangement is the\npublic service nature of the obligation to be undertaken by the operator in a commercial transaction. The\npublic service nature of the services to be provided using the service concession asset is assessed\nirrespective of the identity of the party that operates the services. A service concession arrangement\ncontractually obliges the operator to provide some, if not all, of the services to the public on behalf of the\npublic sector entity. Other common features of a service concession arrangement within the scope of this\nStandard are:  \n(a) the grantor is a public sector entity;  \n-----  (b) the operator is responsible for at least some of the management of the service concession asset\nand related services and does not merely act as an agent on behalf of the grantor;  \n(c) the arrangement sets or limits the initial prices to be levied by the operator and regulates price\nrevisions over the period of the service concession arrangement;  \n(d) the operator is obliged to hand over the service concession asset to the grantor in a specified\ncondition at the end of the period of the arrangement, for little or no incremental consideration,\nirrespective of which party initially financed it; and  \n(e) the arrangement is governed by a contract that sets out performance standards, mechanisms for\nadjusting prices, and arrangements for arbitrating disputes.  \nB5 Appendix A defines a service concession asset. Examples of service concession assets include roads (and\nland under roads), bridges, tunnels, prisons, hospitals, airports, water distribution facilities, energy supply\nand telecommunication networks, permanent installations for military and other operations, registries and\ndatabases, and other tangible or intangible assets that are expected to be used during more than one\nreporting period in delivering public services.",

        "page_content=": "### Asset provides public services\nB6 Assessing whether an asset provides public services requires judgement, taking into account the nature and\nrelative significance of each component and the services provided. For example, a courthouse building\nprovides multiple services, such as courts, administrative offices and associated services. However, the\nprimary purpose of the building is to provide court services, which are considered to be public services. The\ncourt services are necessary or essential to the general public and are generally expected to be provided by a\npublic sector entity in accordance with government policy or regulation. The court services are accessible to\nthe public, even if it is a subset of the community that uses the services. The services provided by the\nadministrative offices may be unrelated to the court services and therefore considered ancillary if they are\ninsignificant to the arrangement as a whole, and in that case would not affect the assessment that the\nbuilding provides public services. However, if the unrelated administrative services were significant to the\narrangement as a whole, the courthouse building might be assessed as not providing public services.  \nB7 If an arrangement provides public services principally through a primary asset, and a secondary asset is\nused or is mainly used to complement the primary asset, such as student accommodation for a public\nuniversity, the secondary asset would be regarded as providing public services as well. As another example,\na hospital car park constructed by an operator as part of the arrangement to construct a hospital that largely\nprovides public services would be considered part of the hospital service concession arrangement. The car\npark may provide limited ancillary services without affecting the assessment that the car park is used to\nprovide public services. However, if the car park was not constructed as part of the hospital service\nconcession arrangement (eg subsequent to the construction of the hospital or with a different party) and is\nlargely of a commercial nature (eg car parking is available to the general public, including hospital patrons),\nthe car park would be regarded as an asset that does not provide public services, and therefore outside the\nscope of this Standard.  \nB8 Where the services provided by an asset are used wholly internally by a public sector entity for the purpose\nof assisting the public sector entity to deliver public services, but managed by an external party, the\narrangement is likely to be an outsourcing arrangement or a lease, rather than a service concession\narrangement. For example, the provision of information technology services to a government department\nproviding emergency services to the public is likely to be an outsourcing contract, which may contain a\nlease of the information technology hardware. The accompanying Implementation Guidance also illustrates\ncommon types of arrangements.  \nB9 For an asset to provide public services, it is not necessary for the public to have physical access to the asset.\nFor example, a military base provides public services (defence activities) even though the public is unlikely\nto have physical access to the military base.",

For example, an operator in an arrangement to construct and operate a hospital in accordance\nwith the grantor\u2019s directions would need to provide services more managerial in nature than cleaning,\nbuilding maintenance and security services for the hospital after its construction in order for the\narrangement to be considered a service concession arrangement. Cleaning, building maintenance and\nsecurity services would generally be regarded as relatively insignificant to the public services provided by  \n-----  the hospital. Therefore, if the operator is responsible only for constructing the hospital and then providing\nall or any of those services, the operator is unlikely to be considered to be responsible for some of the\nmanagement of the public services provided by the hospital. However, if after constructing the hospital the\noperator also provides scheduling of staff and resources (even if provided by the grantor), the operator is\nlikely to be responsible for some of the management of the hospital public services, and not acting like an\nagent of the grantor.

Paragraph 6 of the Standard specifies the condition under which a whole-oflife asset is recognised by the grantor. The assessment of whether a service concession asset should be\nrecognised in accordance with paragraph 5 (or paragraph 6 for a whole-of-life asset) is made on the basis of\nall of the facts and circumstances of the arrangement.  \nB16 The fundamental principle reflected in paragraphs 5 and 6 is determining whether the grantor controls the\nunderlying asset or assets of a service concession arrangement. The ability to exclude or regulate the access\nof others to the benefits of an asset is an essential element of control that distinguishes an entity\u2019s assets\nfrom public goods that all entities can access and benefit from. If the service concession arrangement\nprovides for the grantor to control the price (for example, the contract may set the initial prices to be levied\nby the operator and regulate price revisions over the period of the service concession arrangement), the\nservices to be provided and to whom the services must be provided, then the grantor controls the service\nconcession asset regardless of whether there is any regulation by a third-party regulator.  \n-----  B17 Control should be distinguished from management. If the grantor has both the degree of control described in\nparagraph 5(a) and any significant residual interest in the asset (as noted in paragraph 5(b)), the operator is\nonly managing the asset on the grantor\u2019s behalf \u2013 even though, in many cases, it may have wide managerial\ndiscretion.  \nB18 The control or regulation referred to in paragraph 5(a) could be by contract, or otherwise.

        "page_content=": "### Regulation\nB19 If a service concession contract by itself does not result in the grantor having explicit control over the\nservices and/or pricing of the services, the grantor might still have control of the service concession asset as\na result of regulation by a third party. Regulation of what services the operator must provide, to whom it\nmust provide them, and at what price, in the manner specified in paragraph 5(a), is a means by which a\ngrantor can demonstrate control of the substantive benefits of the service concession asset. Grantor control\nof a service concession asset through regulation does not require the contract to refer to the regulation or the\ngrantor to control or be related to the regulator. The third-party regulator might, for example, regulate other\nentities that operate in the same industry or sector as the grantor. This includes circumstances in which the\ngrantor buys all of the services as well as those in which some or all of the services are bought by other\nusers.  \n_Regulation of pricing_  \nB20 Control or regulation of the pricing of the services is one of the three factors set out in paragraph 5(a) to be\nconsidered in determining whether the grantor controls an asset and should recognise it as a service\nconcession asset. For example, a regulated price includes a specified price, which may be zero, that the\noperator can charge for the services of the asset. The grantor would also have to control the services to be\nprovided and the recipients of the services in order to recognise a service concession asset. This approach is\nconsistent with the fundamental principle in paragraph B16 of an entity controlling an asset if it has the\nability to exclude or regulate the access of others to the benefits of the asset. For example, for the purpose of\nparagraph 5(a), the grantor does not need to have complete control of the price: it is sufficient for the price\nto be regulated by the grantor, or by a third-party regulator (eg by a capping mechanism). Prices are\nregarded as controlled by the grantor in a regulated environment when a third-party regulator regulates the\npricing of the services provided with a service concession asset. The regulation removes the ability of the\noperator to determine the price and, for the purpose of paragraph 5(a), the pricing of the services is\nconsidered to be set implicitly by the grantor as the contract between the grantor and the operator\neffectively incorporates the price regulation. In some cases, the grantor could have specified an alternative\npricing regime but has chosen not to do so, effectively asserting \u2018passive\u2019 control of the pricing. If the\ncontract specifies the grantor controls the services and the recipients of the services, the third-party\nregulation of the pricing of the services means that the operator does not control the pricing or the other\ncriteria specified in paragraph 5(a), and accordingly the grantor controls the asset. If the operator is able to\ndetermine to whom the services are provided, but is subject to grantor control over what services may be\nprovided and the pricing, the grantor does not control the asset. The accompanying Implementation\nGuidance illustrates common types of arrangements where the grantor or the operator might control the\nvarious factors.  \nB21 Where a third-party regulator regulates the pricing or the services that the asset must provide (as specified\nin paragraph 5(a)), it is not essential for the grantor to control or direct the activities of the third-party\nregulator for the grantor to have control of the service concession asset. For example, a State grantor in a\nservice concession arrangement might meet the regulated pricing condition specified in paragraph 5(a) even\nthough the relevant regulation is carried out by an independent Commonwealth regulator. Furthermore, it is\nnot necessary for the grantor to refer to the regulator in the contract. The grantor might rely on the regulator\nexercising its powers within the parameters applicable to the regulator at the inception of the contract.  \nB22 Governments often have the power to regulate the behaviour of entities operating in certain sectors of the\neconomy, either directly or through specifically created agencies. For the purpose of paragraph 5(a), such\nbroad regulatory powers do not constitute control. In this Standard, the term \u2018regulate\u2019 is intended to be\napplied only in the context of the terms and conditions of the service concession arrangement. For example,\na regulator of rail services may determine rates that apply to the rail industry as a whole. Depending on the\nlegal framework in a jurisdiction, such rates may be implicit in the contract governing a service concession\narrangement involving the provision of railway transportation, or they may be specifically referred to\ntherein. However, in both cases, the control of the pricing of the service concession asset is derived from\neither the contract or the specific regulation applicable to rail services, without considering whether the\ngrantor is related to the regulator of rail services.  \n-----  B23 Where a service concession arrangement does not clearly fall within an existing regulatory framework (eg\nwhere there is more than one possible source of regulation), the contract will need to incorporate the\nspecific regulatory framework that stipulates the services, the users and/or the pricing to be charged for the\nservices in order for the requirements of paragraph 5(a) to be met.  \nB24 For a grantor to control any of the factors listed in paragraph 5(a) through third-party regulation, the\nregulation must be substantive. Non-substantive features, such as a cap that will apply only in remote\ncircumstances, shall be ignored. Conversely, if, for example, an arrangement purports to give the operator\nfreedom to set prices but any excess profit is returned to the grantor, the operator\u2019s return is capped and the\nprice element of the control test is met.  \n_Partly regulated asset_  \nB25 Sometimes the use of a service concession asset is partly regulated in the manner described in\nparagraph 5(a) and partly unregulated. These arrangements may take a variety of forms, such as:  \n(a) any asset that is physically separable and capable of being operated independently and meets the\ndefinition of a cash-generating unit as defined in AASB 136 is analysed separately to determine\nwhether the conditions set out in paragraph 5(a) are met if it is used wholly for unregulated\npurposes (eg this might apply to a private wing of a hospital, where the remainder of the hospital\nis used to treat public patients); and  \n(b) when purely ancillary activities (such as a hospital shop) are unregulated, the control tests shall be\napplied as if those services did not exist, because in cases in which the grantor controls the\nservices in the manner described in paragraph 5(a), the existence of ancillary activities does not\ndetract from the grantor\u2019s control of the service concession asset.  \nB26 There may be arrangements that include unregulated services that are neither purely ancillary nor delivered\nby using a physically separable portion of the total asset. For example, a grantor may control prices charged\nto children and seniors at a sports facility but the amounts charged to adults are not controlled.

This\nrecognition also depends on the asset meeting the recognition criteria in AASB 116 or AASB 138:  \n-----  (a) AASB 116 requires that the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised\nas an asset if, and only if:  \n(i) it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the\nentity; and  \n(ii) the cost of the item can be measured reliably;  \n(b) AASB 138 requires that an intangible asset shall be recognised if, and only if:  \n(i) it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset\nwill flow to the entity; and  \n(ii) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.  \nB45 Those criteria, together with the terms and conditions of the contract, need to be considered by the grantor\nin determining whether to recognise the service concession asset during the period in which the asset is\nconstructed or developed. For property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, if the recognition criteria\nare met during the construction or development period, the grantor recognises the service concession asset\nto the appropriate extent during that period.  \nB46 The first recognition criterion requires the flow of economic benefits to the grantor. According to the\n_Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, as identified in AASB 1048_\n_Interpretation of Standards, for not-for-profit entities, future economic benefits are synonymous with the_\nnotion of service potential. From the grantor\u2019s point of view, the primary purpose of a service concession\nasset is to provide service potential on behalf of the public sector grantor. Similar to an asset the grantor\nconstructs or develops for its own use, the grantor would assess, at the time the costs of construction or\ndevelopment are incurred, the terms of the contract to determine whether, in addition to retaining control of\nthe land on which the service concession asset is being developed, economic benefits embodied in the\nservice concession asset are controlled by the grantor at that time.  \nB47 The second recognition criterion requires that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Accordingly, to\nmeet the recognition criteria in AASB 116 or AASB 138, as appropriate, the grantor must have reliable\ninformation about the cost of the asset during its construction or development. For example, if the service\nconcession arrangement requires the operator to provide the grantor with progress reports during the asset\u2019s\nconstruction or development, the costs incurred may be measurable, and would therefore meet the\nrecognition criteria in AASB 116 for constructed assets or in AASB 138 for developed intangible assets.\nAlso, where the grantor has little ability to avoid accepting an asset constructed or developed to meet the\nspecifications of the service concession arrangement, the costs shall be recognised as progress is made\ntowards completion of the asset. Thus, the grantor shall recognise a service concession asset and an\nassociated liability.",

Furthermore, the terms of the arrangement may also depend on the specific features of the\noverall legal framework, including contract law, of the particular jurisdiction.  \nB51 Depending on the terms of the service concession arrangement, the grantor may compensate the operator for\nthe service concession asset and service provision by any combination of the following:  \n(a) making payments (eg cash) to the operator; and  \n(b) compensating the operator by other means, such as:  \n(i) granting the operator the right to earn revenue from third-party users of the service\nconcession asset; or  \n(ii) granting the operator access to another revenue-generating asset for its use.  \nB52 When the grantor compensates the operator for the service concession asset by making payments to the\noperator, the asset and service components of the payments may be separately identifiable (eg the contract\nspecifies the amount of the predetermined payment or series of payments to be allocated to the service\nconcession asset). The asset and service components of the service concession arrangement are accounted\nfor separately, in accordance with paragraph 20.  \n_Separately identifiable payments_  \nB53 A service concession arrangement may have separately identifiable asset and service components of the\npayments in a variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:  \n(a) part of a payment stream that varies according to the availability of the service concession asset\nitself and another part that varies according to usage or performance of certain services can be\nidentified;  \n(b) different components of the service concession arrangement run for different periods or can be\nterminated separately. For example, an individual service component can be terminated without\naffecting the continuation of the rest of the arrangement; or  \n(c) different components of the service concession arrangement can be renegotiated separately. For\nexample, the upgrade or replacement of major components of a service concession asset are\naddressed separately, or a service component is market tested and some or all of the cost\nincreases or reductions are passed on to the grantor in such a way that the part of the payment by\nthe grantor that relates specifically to that service can be identified.  \n_Payments not separately identifiable_  \nB54 For the purpose of applying the requirements of this Standard, payments and other consideration required\nby the arrangement are allocated at the inception of the arrangement or upon a reassessment of the\narrangement into those for the service concession asset and those for other components of the service\nconcession arrangement (eg maintenance and operation services) on the basis of their relative fair values.\nThe fair value (current replacement cost) of the service concession asset represents amounts related to the\nasset and excludes other components of the service concession arrangement. In some cases, identifying\npayments for the asset and payments for other components of the service concession arrangement will\nrequire the grantor to use an estimation technique. For example, a grantor may estimate the payments\nrelated to the asset by reference to the fair value of a comparable asset in an agreement that contains no\nother components, or by estimating the payments for the other components in the service concession\narrangement by reference to comparable arrangements and then deducting these payments from the total\npayments under the arrangement.  \n_Operator receives other forms of compensation_  \nB55 The types of compensation transactions referred to in paragraph 14(b) are non-monetary exchange\ntransactions. Paragraph 24 of AASB 116 and paragraph 45 of AASB 138, as appropriate, provide guidance\non these circumstances.  \nB56 When the operator is granted the right to earn revenue from third-party users of the service concession asset,\nor from another revenue-generating asset, or receives non-cash compensation from the grantor, the grantor\ndoes not incur a cost directly for acquiring the service concession asset. These forms of consideration to the\noperator may be intended to compensate the operator both for the cost of the service concession asset and  \n-----  for operating it during the term of the service concession arrangement.

However, in each case, the liability recognised\nin accordance with paragraph 11 shall be initially measured at the same amount as the service concession\nasset, being the fair value (current replacement cost) of the asset in accordance with AASB 13.  \nB61 The grantor also recognises a liability in accordance with paragraph 11 when an existing asset of the grantor\nis reclassified as a service concession asset and the operator provides additional consideration to the grantor.\nThe grantor first recognises the reclassification of its existing asset as a service concession asset in\naccordance with paragraph 8, treating any difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair\nvalue (current replacement cost) as if it is a revaluation of the asset. The second step for the grantor is to\nrecognise the additional consideration provided by the operator (cash or other assets), and a financial\nliability or a liability under the grant of a right to the operator model or both, depending on the nature of the\nservice concession arrangement.  \nB62 Payments made by an operator to a grantor that are separate from the service concession arrangement are\naccounted for based on the nature of the payments. If the payments are:  \n(a) for a right to goods or services, the grantor accounts for the payments as other revenues in\naccordance with AASB 15 or AASB 1058, as appropriate; or  \n(b) for the right to use an asset, the grantor assesses whether the arrangement contains a lease. If the\narrangement contains a lease, the grantor accounts for the payments in accordance with AASB 16\n(paragraph B29(b)).  \n-----  ",

Instead, a liability is recognised (as noted in paragraph 21) and subsequently reduced as\nrevenue is recognised in accordance with paragraph 22 based on the economic substance of the service\nconcession arrangement. Revenue is usually recognised as access to the service concession asset is provided\nto the operator over the term of the service concession arrangement. Paragraph B51 states that the grantor\nmay compensate the operator by a combination of payments and granting a right to earn revenue directly\nfrom third-party users. In cases where the operator\u2019s right to earn third-party revenues significantly reduces\nor eliminates the grantor\u2019s predetermined series of payments to the operator, the liability related to the grant\nof the right to the operator usually would still be reduced (and revenue recognised) over the term of the\narrangement as access is provided to the operator.  \n-----  B72 When the grantor compensates the operator for the service concession asset and services by the provision of\na revenue-generating asset, other than the service concession asset, the liability related to the grant of the\nright to the operator is reduced and revenue relating to the remaining liability is recognised in a manner\nsimilar to that described in the previous paragraph.

The education services provided by\nthe school are accessible to the public, even if it is a subset of the community that uses the\nservices. The assessment of the public service nature of the school is consistent with\nparagraph B6;  \n(c) the grantor is responsible for the services relating to the delivery of education and operational\nservices such as the recruitment of teachers and administration staff, and the maintenance of the\nschool facilities; and  \n(d) the operator is responsible for cleaning and security services for the school.  \nIG5 Based on these facts and circumstances, the grantor concludes the operator does not access the school to\nprovide public services as its provision of cleaning and security services does not constitute management of\nat least some of the public services provided by the school (refer paragraph B10). Accordingly, the\narrangement is not a service concession arrangement and is outside the scope of AASB 1059 (paragraph 2).\nThe cleaning and security services represent an outsourced service to the grantor to enable it to provide the\npublic services through the school.",

The example is based on the facts and circumstances in Example 1\n(paragraphs IG4\u2013IG5). The grantor:  \n(a) in accordance with paragraph 2 \u2013 determines the arrangement for the construction of the school\nand the provision of the services is outside the scope of AASB 1059, consistent with paragraphs\nIG4\u2013IG5; and  \n(b) assesses whether it controls the school or has a right to use the school for recognition under\nanother Accounting Standard.

The grantor determines the hospital is capable of being\noperated with separately identifiable public and private wings;  \n(b) the public wing of the hospital is expected to provide health services to the general public for no\ncost to the patients. The grantor is responsible for the services relating to the delivery of medical\nservices and operational services, including setting key performance requirements, but the\noperator is responsible for the employment of the doctors, nurses and administration staff and\nscheduling the various services;  \n(c) the private wing of the hospital is expected to provide health services to private patients of the\nhospital. The operator is responsible for the services relating to the delivery of medical services\nand operational services, including the employment of doctors, nurses and administration staff.\nThe operator also determines the pricing of the services charged to patients;  \n-----  (d) the hospital is considered to provide public services, as the basic purpose of the hospital is to\nprovide health services that are necessary or essential to the general public. The health services\nprovided by the hospital are accessible to the public, even if it is a subset of the community that\nuses the services and notwithstanding that the private wing of the hospital is to be used by private\npatients. The assessment of the public service nature of the hospital is consistent with paragraph\nB6;  \n(e) the operator is responsible for the cleaning and security services and facility maintenance of both\nthe public wing and the private wing of the hospital. The operator has discretion as to when and\nhow it conducts the facility maintenance of providing upgrades and maintenance of the hospital to\na specified condition;  \n(f) the grantor is entitled to the residual interest in both the public wing and the private wing of the\nhospital at the end of the term of the arrangement, as both wings will transfer to the grantor.\nDuring the term of the arrangement, the grantor\u2019s residual interest and the requirement for the\ngrantor to specifically approve any transferee restricts the operator from selling or pledging the\nhospital; and  \n(g) both the public and private wings are built on government land, leased to the operator for a\nnominal fee.  \nIG17 The grantor assesses separately (consistent with paragraphs B6\u2013B7) whether the public wing and the private\nwing are within the scope of AASB 1059.  \n_Hospital \u2013 Public wing (regulated)_",

In this example, as the grantor controls the land on which the private wing is\nlocated, which provides legal control of the private wing, and the operator is prevented from selling or\npledging its interest in the private wing, the grantor controls the private wing. However, the arrangement\nprovides the operator with the right to use the private wing, because the private wing is a separately\nidentifiable asset and the operator controls the services provided, which patients will be admitted, and the\nprices to be charged during the specified arrangement term. Accordingly:  \n(a) where the grantor retains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, the\ngrantor is the lessor in an operating lease; or  \n(b) where the operator has substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, the grantor\nderecognises the asset and recognises a receivable in accordance with the accounting for a finance\nlease.  \nIG23 In this example, the wings of the hospital are capable of being separated into a public wing (regulated\nportion) and a private wing (unregulated portion). However, some service concession arrangements may\ninvolve a hospital that is partly regulated and partly unregulated based on the number of patients that are\nadmitted as a public patient or a private patient, instead of being physically separate as per paragraph\nIG16(a). In such circumstances, judgement will be required as to the relative significance of the regulated\nversus unregulated activities in order to determine whether the grantor has control of the asset and/or has\ngranted a right of use to the operator. For example, if the hospital admissions are expected to comprise\nsubstantially public patients, then the admission of private patients would be considered as ancillary\n(unregulated) activities of the hospital and the hospital considered to be used wholly for regulated purposes\nin addressing the accounting for the service concession asset. In addition, a lease from the grantor to the\noperator requires a specifically identifiable asset with a right of use granted for a specified time, so in these\ncircumstances it is unlikely a lease could be identified.",

The\nrelevant terms of the arrangement are:  \n(a) in exchange for the sale of the electricity distribution business, the grantor receives cash relating\nto the sale of its interest in the net assets of the business, and settlement by the operator of the\nliabilities of the business;  \n(b) the operator is able to operate the electricity distribution business subject to regulation by a thirdparty regulator of electricity distributors. Additionally, although the operator has discretion to set\nthe prices of the electricity services, the operator must seek the third-party regulator\u2019s approval\nfor changes in pricing; and  \n(c) the operator controls:  \n-  the operating activities of the electricity distribution business, including decisions to expand\nor modify the distribution network or to continue providing electricity services, subject to\nprotective rights of the grantor to ensure electricity supply in certain circumstances. If the\noperator decides to discontinue providing electricity services, the grantor has an option to\nbuy back the business from the operator at fair value; and  \n-----  -  the recipients of the services \u2013 the operator can expand the distribution network beyond the\nnetwork existing at the time of entering the contract without requiring the grantor\u2019s approval.  \n_Scope_  \nIG25 Based on the facts and circumstances, the grantor concludes the arrangement for the electricity distribution\nbusiness is outside the scope of AASB 1059 (paragraph 2) \u2013 although electricity distribution would be\nregarded as public services, the operator does not provide the services on behalf of the grantor and the\narrangement is not for a specific period of time. The grantor\u2019s protective rights do not mean that the\noperator provides the services on behalf of the grantor. The protective rights would have the same impact as\nfor an operator that had developed its own electricity network rather than purchasing it from a grantor \u2013 the\nrights do not give the grantor control of the distribution network.  \n_Grantor\u2019s control of asset for recognition_  \nIG26 The grantor would also be unable to recognise a service concession asset in these circumstances, because\nthe grantor is able to control or regulate only some of the aspects addressed in paragraph 5(a), as follows:  \n(a) the grantor controls the pricing of the services provided by the operator, as the requirement for\nthe operator to seek approval from the third-party regulator removes the operator\u2019s ability to\nregulate the pricing and, for the purpose of paragraph 5(a), the pricing of the services is therefore\nconsidered to be set implicitly by the grantor (refer paragraph B20);  \n(b) the operator controls the services to be provided by the business. The grantor\u2019s protective rights\nand option to buy back the business from the operator, in the event the operator decides to\ndiscontinue the provision of electricity services, do not prevent the operator determining the\nservices to be provided; and  \n(c) the operator controls the recipients of the services as outlined in paragraph IG24(c).  \nIG27 There is no residual interest in the arrangement, as the sale is not limited to a specified period, and so the\ngrantor would also not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 5(b). Furthermore, the grantor\u2019s buy-back\noption is exercisable only at fair value and so does not give the grantor any significant residual interest. As\nthe asset need not be used for the provision of public services for its entire remaining economic life (the\noperator has discretion as to how to use the asset) and the criteria in paragraph 5(a) are not met, the\nconditions in paragraph 6 for a whole-of-life asset are not met.  \nIG28 Although the grantor cannot recognise a service concession asset, the grantor assesses whether it controls\nthe electricity distribution network, has the right to use the network, or controls any other rights requiring\nrecognition under another Accounting Standard. In making this assessment, the grantor takes into account\nthe factors noted in the previous paragraphs.  \n_Recognition of arrangement_  \nIG29 Based on the assessment in paragraphs IG26\u2013IG27, the grantor determines that it does not control the asset\nor have a right to use the asset subsequent to the sale of the electricity distribution business. The grantor\ntherefore derecognises the asset under another Accounting Standard, such as AASB 116.",

The operator must maintain the electricity distribution network to the specified age and\ncondition at the end of the arrangement.  \nIG31 Based on the facts and circumstances, the grantor determines:  \n(a) the arrangement for the operator to operate the electricity distribution network is outside the\nscope of AASB 1059, as the grantor\u2019s protective rights to ensure electricity supply in certain\ncircumstances do not mean that the operator provides the services on behalf of the grantor;  \n(b) even if the arrangement was a service concession arrangement, it does not control the asset for\nrecognition under paragraph 5(a), for the reasons outlined in paragraphs IG26(a)\u2013(c); and  \n-----  (c) it controls the significant residual interest at the end of the arrangement, as the electricity\ndistribution network reverts to the grantor at the end of the arrangement. Accordingly, the\narrangement is a privatisation and not a sale.  \nIG32 Based on the assessment in the previous paragraph, the grantor determines that it does not control the asset\n(the electricity distribution network) or have a right to use the asset under the arrangement. The grantor\u2019s\nprotective rights do not give the grantor any more significant interest in the distribution network than it\nwould have with those same rights in relation to an operator that had developed its own network. The\ngrantor therefore derecognises the asset under another Accounting Standard, such as AASB 116, and\ndetermines whether it controls any other rights requiring recognition under another Accounting Standard.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Arrangement terms and assumptions (common to Examples 6\u20137)  \nIE3 These terms are common to the two examples that follow.  \nIE4 The terms of the arrangement require an operator to construct a road on land owned by the grantor \u2013\ncompleting construction within two years \u2013 and maintain and operate the road to a specified standard for\neight years (ie years 3\u201310). The arrangement is within the scope of this Standard and the road meets the\nconditions for recognition of a service concession asset in paragraph 5.  \nIE5 The terms of the arrangement also require the operator to resurface the road when the original surface has\ndeteriorated below a specified condition. The operator estimates that it will have to undertake the\nresurfacing at the end of year 8 at a fair value (current replacement cost) of CU110. The compensation to\nthe operator for this service is included in the predetermined series of payments and/or the revenue the\noperator has the right to earn from the service concession asset or another revenue-generating asset granted\nto the operator by the grantor. The compensation to the operator also covers the annual operating costs of\nCU12.  \nIE6 It is assumed that the original road surface is a separate component of the service concession asset and\nmeets the criteria for recognition specified in AASB 116 when the service concession asset is initially\nrecognised. The road surface is therefore recognised as a separate component of the initial fair value\n(current replacement cost) of the service concession asset and depreciated over years 3\u20138. This depreciation\nperiod is shorter than that for the road base, and takes into account that resurfacing would ordinarily occur\nevery six years, compared with replacing the road base in 25 years. During the construction phase, it is\nassumed that only the road base is constructed in year 1, and that the road only becomes ready to use at the\nend of year 2.  \nIE7 The replacement of a major component of the road as a separate component of the service concession asset\noccurs in year 8, and is recognised as a new service concession asset when the resurfacing work is\nperformed. This also results in an increase in the liability recognised by the grantor, in accordance with\nparagraph B48. Where the liability relates to the grant of a right to the operator model, additional revenue in\nrespect of this increase is recognised evenly over the remaining term of the arrangement. However, if the\nexpenditure represented an improvement in service potential such as a new traffic lane rather than\nrestoration to original service capability then it would be appropriate to instead recognise revenue relevant\nto that improvement only once it has occurred.  \nIE8 At the beginning of year 3, the total fair value (current replacement cost) of the road is CU1,082, comprised\nof CU972 related to the base layers (including implied funding costs due to the extended construction\nperiod) and CU110 related to the surface layers. The fair value of the surface layers is used to estimate the\nfair value of the resurfacing (which is treated as a replacement component in accordance with AASB 116).\nThe estimated life of surface layers (ie six years) is also used to estimate the depreciation of the replacement\ncomponent in years 9 and 10.  \nIE9 The road base has an economic life of 25 years. Annual depreciation is recognised by the grantor on a\nstraight-line basis. It is therefore CU39 (CU972/25) for the base layers. The surface layers are depreciated  \n-----  over 6 years (years 3\u20138 for the original component, and starting in year 9 for the replacement component).\nAnnual depreciation related to the original surface layers and the replacement surface layers is CU18\n(CU110/6).  \nIE10 The effective interest rate in the service concession arrangement is 6.18 per cent per year.  \nIE11 It is assumed that all cash flows take place at the end of the year.  \nIE12 It is assumed that the time value of money is not significant.  \nIE13 At the end of year 10, the arrangement will end and the operator will transfer the operation of the road to the\ngrantor.  \nIE14 The total compensation to the operator under each of the two examples is inclusive of each of the\ncomponents of the service concession arrangement and reflects the fair values (current replacement cost) for\neach of the assets and services, which are set out in Table 6.  \nIE15 The grantor\u2019s accounting policies include:  \n(a) service concession assets (property, plant, and equipment) \u2013 measured initially at fair value\n(current replacement cost) and subsequently in accordance with the cost model. Impairment is\nrecognised when the carrying amount exceeds the current replacement cost;  \n(b) financial liabilities \u2013 subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method;\nand  \n(c) borrowing costs \u2013 expensed in the period incurred regardless of how the borrowings are applied.",

The asset is recognised as it is constructed (CU525 in\nyear 1 and CU557 in year 2). Depreciation is recognised annually (CU57, comprised of CU39 (CU972/25)\nfor the base layers and CU18 (CU110/6) for the surface layers), starting from year 3.  \nIE18 The grantor initially recognises a financial liability equal to the fair value (current replacement cost) of the\nservice concession asset under construction at the end of year 1 (CU525). The liability is increased at the\nend of year 2 to reflect both the fair value of the additional construction (CU525) and the finance charge\n(CU32) on the outstanding financial liability. Because the amount of the predetermined payment related to\nthe service component of the service concession arrangement is known, the grantor is able to determine the\namount of the annual payment that reduces the liability each period.

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nReasons for issuing this Standard  \nBC2 In Australia, public sector entities enter into service concession arrangements (also called public-private\npartnerships (PPPs), build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) arrangements and other similar names) as a means\nof developing and delivering infrastructure and other assets for public services such as roads, bridges,\ntunnels, prisons, hospitals, airports, water distribution facilities, energy supply and telecommunication\nnetworks, permanent installations for military and other operations, registries and databases, and other\ntangible or intangible assets that are expected to be used during more than one reporting period in delivering\npublic services. The public sector entity (the grantor) typically engages another entity (the operator) to\nconstruct or otherwise provide the underlying infrastructure and other assets through which the operator will\nprovide public services on behalf of the grantor. In exchange for the asset (or assets) and services, the\ngrantor makes payments to the operator or grants the operator a right to charge users of the service\nconcession asset (or assets).  \nBC3 Prior to the issue of this Standard, there was no specific Australian Accounting Standard that prescribed the\naccounting for service concession arrangements from the grantor\u2019s perspective.  \nBC4 In determining an accounting policy for service concession arrangements in accordance with AASB 108\n_Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, in the absence of AASB 1059, an_\nAustralian public sector entity might consider existing accounting requirements for service concession\narrangements, including:  \n(a) AASB Interpretation 12 _Service Concession Arrangements \u2013 AASB Interpretation 12 (which_\nincorporates IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements) provides the accounting requirements\nfor service concession arrangements by the operator of a service concession arrangement. AASB\nInterpretation 12 does not apply to a grantor;  \n(b) AASB 16 _Leases \u2013 AASB 16 provides guidance where the grantor makes payments to the_\noperator, but does not provide guidance where the grantor grants the operator a right to charge\nusers of the service concession asset;  \n(c) AASB Interpretation 4 _Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease \u2013 AASB_\nInterpretation 4 provides guidance for the application of AASB 16; and  \n(d) IPSAS 32 _Service Concession Arrangements: Grantor \u2013 the International Public Sector_\nAccounting Standards Board (IPSASB) published IPSAS 32 in October 2011. IPSAS 32\nprescribes the accounting for service concession assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses by\ngrantors. IPSAS 32 mirrors IFRIC 12 in most aspects.  \nAustralian public sector entities had also considered previous requirements in the United Kingdom set out\nin Financial Reporting Standard FRS 5 _Reporting the Substance of Transactions, issued by the UK_\nAccounting Standard Board. FRS 5 required an entity to recognise an asset and a liability where the entity\nhad substantially all or the majority of risks and rewards incident to the ownership of a service concession\nasset.  \nBC5 The lack of a specific Australian Accounting Standard that prescribed the accounting for a service\nconcession arrangement from the grantor\u2019s perspective resulted in divergence in the accounting for such\narrangements. For example, some grantors recognised service concession assets and liabilities in their\nstatement of financial position while others did not. Given the significance of service concession\narrangements to the Australian economy, it is important that the AASB issue an Accounting Standard to\naddress the lack of explicit requirements for accounting for such arrangements. Recognition of service  \n-----  concession assets and related liabilities is important in assisting users of financial statements to understand\nthe resources and obligations of a grantor involved in the provision of public services.  \nBC6 The Board considered a range of alternatives for the accounting for service concession arrangements by a\ngrantor. This included consideration of:  \n(a) whether under the hierarchy for selecting accounting policies set out in AASB 108, the grantor\ncould apply AASB Interpretation 12 by analogy. The Board (in December 2007) noted that, in\naccordance with AASB 108, the management of an entity must use its judgement in developing\nand applying an accounting policy that results in information that is both relevant and reliable to\nthe economic decision-making needs of users, including that the financial statements reflect the\neconomic substance of the transaction or event. In making this judgement, management must\nrefer to, and consider the applicability of, the requirements and guidance in Australian\nAccounting Standards (including Interpretations) dealing with similar and related issues, and the\ndefinitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts in the Framework for the Preparation\n_and Presentation of Financial Statements. The Board concluded public sector grantors are_\nrequired to consider Interpretation 12 in developing their accounting policy for service concession\narrangements, and could choose to follow the Interpretation, although it does not apply\nmandatorily;  \n(b) the IPSASB\u2019s project on grantor accounting for service concession arrangements, which the\nBoard followed closely by issuing the IPSASB\u2019s consultation documents in Australia as\nInvitation to Comment ITC 16 Request for Comment on IPSASB Consultation Paper Accounting\nand Financial Reporting for Service Concession Arrangements (April 2008) and Exposure Draft\nED 194 _Request for Comment on IPSASB Exposure Draft_ Service Concession Arrangements:\nGrantor (April 2010). The Board considered the feedback from constituents in preparing its\nsubmissions on the IPSASB proposals; and  \n(c) other approaches to the accounting for service concession arrangements, which are identified\nfurther in this Basis for Conclusions.",

        "page_content=": "## Issue of ED 261 and additional public versions  \nBC7 After considering the alternatives, the Board decided to develop an Australian Accounting Standard on\ngrantor accounting for service concession arrangements, based on IPSAS 32, to address the lack of\nguidance. The Board issued Exposure Draft ED 261 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantor in May\n2015. The Board took into account its policy of making Australian Accounting Standards with a view to\nrequiring like transactions and events to be accounted for in a like manner by all types of entities,\nreferred to as \u2018transaction neutrality\u2019, in restricting the scope of ED 261 to a grantor that is a public sector\nentity. The Board noted that it is highly unlikely that a service concession arrangement would involve a\ngrantor that is a private sector entity. Consequently, only in rare instances would a private sector grantor\nrequire specific guidance on the accounting for a service concession arrangement.  \nBC8 The Board conducted extensive outreach on the proposals in ED 261, including roundtable discussions in\nMelbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, field tests in a number of Australian jurisdictions and other targeted\noutreach.  \nBC9 The Board received ten comment letters in response to ED 261. The key responses to ED 261 were:  \n(a) all respondents were supportive of the proposals set out in ED 261 on the basis that the proposals\nwould provide a consistent approach to the accounting for service concession arrangements from\na public sector grantor perspective;  \n(b) some respondents commented that the proposals were more rule-based than principle-based.\nThese respondents recommended that a principle-based Standard be developed so that the\nStandard could address emerging innovative service concession arrangements that perhaps a rulebased Standard would not be able to adequately address; and  \n(c) overall, respondents requested additional guidance and examples on the concept of control, fair\nvalue measurement of service concession assets and liabilities, and accounting for the\narrangements when transitioning to the Standard.  \nBC10 As the Board considered a broad range of issues in developing this Standard following the ED 261 exposure\nprocess, numerous issues papers and draft wording for paragraphs of the Standard were published as Board\nagenda papers. This gave constituents the opportunity to follow the debate and to provide comments on the\nissues and drafting contemporaneously.  \nBC11 In February 2017, the Board also issued a Fatal-Flaw Review version of the Standard for public comment.\nSubmissions were received from seven constituents. The majority of the respondents were supportive of  \n-----  the Board\u2019s approach in the Fatal-Flaw Review version. However, some respondents had concerns\nparticularly over the proposed requirement for a grantor to recognise as a service concession asset an\nintangible asset that the grantor had not been previously recognised and the proposed guidance on\npublic services. Single respondents also objected strongly to (1) the approach to determining the\ngrantor\u2019s control or regulation of the pricing of the services of a service concession asset and (2) the\nproposed requirement to recognise a service concession arrangement that involves the grant of a right\nto the operator.  \nBC12 The Board considered these issues and the comments received at its March and May 2017 meetings. In\nparticular, the Board added additional implementation guidance to illustrate the differences between service\nconcession arrangements and other types of arrangements (construction and service contracts, leases, and\nsale and privatisation arrangements). The Board also clarified the treatment of previously unrecognised\nintangible service concession assets and the application guidance regarding public services, for example.  \nBC13 The proposed requirements were then finalised in June 2017 in the form of a Pre-Ballot Draft of the\nStandard. This version, which typically is distributed only to Board members, was also circulated to the\nrespondents to the Fatal-Flaw Review version that had provided substantive comments. Further comments\nwere received from those respondents and were considered by the Board in finalising the Standard. As a\nresult of those comments, for example, the definition of \u2018service concession arrangement\u2019 was extended to\nrefer to the operator being responsible for at least some of the management of the public services provided\nthrough the service concession asset, which had featured in the application guidance and in some of the\nimplementation guidance examples. References to land under roads as service concession assets were also\nadded, and the accounting for upgrades and the replacement of major components of service concession\nassets clarified.",

The Board noted that this scope would\nbe wider than that of IPSAS 32 as International Public Sector Accounting Standards do not apply to forprofit entities.  \nBC16 The Board considered the constituents\u2019 feedback on ED 261 and additional outreach, in particular some\nconstituents\u2019 concerns that a for-profit grantor applying this Standard may not be able to state that its\nfinancial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards) issued by\nthe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (see paragraphs BC124\u2013BC127 for a comparison\nwith IFRS Standards). The Board also noted the constituents\u2019 feedback that although they prefer a for-profit\nentity to be able to state compliance with IFRS Standards when applying this Standard, transaction\nneutrality across the entire public sector is more important in this instance. The Board therefore reaffirmed\nits view that the Standard should apply to all public sector entities, whether for-profit or not-for-profit. The\nBoard concluded that this was an appropriate, limited exception to its general policy that compliance with\nAustralian Accounting Standards by for-profit entities would result in compliance with IFRS Standards. The\nBoard noted this approach would reduce or eliminate any incentive for structuring service concession\narrangements through for-profit public sector grantors.",

        "page_content=": "## Terminology  \nBC17 IPSAS 32 is expressed in jurisdiction-neutral language. The Board considered that some of the terminology\nin IPSAS 32 does not readily translate to the Australian environment and decided that different terms and\nphrases would be appropriate for entities applying Australian Accounting Standards. For example,\nconsistent with the terminology used in other Australian Accounting Standards, the Standard adopts the\nterm \u2018contract\u2019 rather than the term \u2018binding arrangement\u2019, and the Standard refers to operator \u2018access\u2019\nrather than \u2018use\u2019 as in the definitions of a \u2018grantor\u2019 and an \u2018operator\u2019 in IPSAS 32.  \nBC18 ED 261 proposed defining the term \u2018public service\u2019 as \u201cA service that is provided by government or one of\nits controlled entities, as part of the usual government function, to the community, either directly (through\nthe public sector) or by financing the provision of services\u201d. Constituents in their feedback on ED 261\nstated that although they supported the inclusion of a \u2018public service\u2019 definition, the proposed definition was  \n-----  unclear. The Board concluded that any definition of \u2018public service\u2019 would result in similar interpretative\nissues as those raised by constituents in relation to the definition proposed in ED 261. The Board therefore\ndecided, instead of providing a definition, the Standard should include guidance on \u2018public service\u2019 for\nassessing whether an arrangement is within the scope of the Standard. The Board also noted this approach is\nconsistent with IPSAS 32 and AASB Interpretation 12, which do not contain a definition of \u2018public service\u2019.\nThe Board decided that the guidance should be in the form of examples and features to be considered, such\nas:  \n(a) an operator must be responsible for at least some of the management of the service concession\nasset and related services, and not act merely as an agent of the grantor; and  \n(b) services that are insignificant to the arrangement as a whole may be ancillary services.  \nBC19 The Board also decided to amend the \u2018service concession asset\u2019 definition (as proposed in ED 261) so that it  \nrefers to an asset accessed by the operator to provide public services on behalf of the grantor, for consistency\nwith the public service guidance.",

        "page_content=": "## Recognition of service concession assets  \nControl  \nBC20 The Board considered a number of alternative approaches in developing the proposed guidance for\nassessing whether a grantor controls the service concession asset, including:  \n(a) the risks and rewards approach;  \n(b) the rights and obligations approach;  \n(c) the control or regulation approach (the IPSAS 32 concept of control); and  \n(d) an approach analogous to the principles of control specified in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial\n_Statements._  \nBC21 The Board decided to adopt the IPSAS 32 concept of control (the control or regulation approach) for the\nfollowing reasons.  \nBC22 In considering the merits of the risks and rewards and the control-based approach to assess whether the\ngrantor should recognise the asset, the Board noted that the risks and rewards approach focuses on the\neconomic aspects of the terms and conditions in the arrangement. The Board did not consider this focus to\nbe appropriate for service concession arrangements in the Australian public sector. This is because the\nprimary purpose of a service concession asset, from the grantor\u2019s point of view, is to provide specified\npublic services on behalf of the grantor and not to provide economic benefits such as revenue generated by\nsuch assets (eg from user fees). A control-based approach focuses on control over the service potential of\nthe service concession asset.  \nBC23 Service concession arrangements are often entered into to share the risks between the grantor and the\noperator. The Board questioned whether objective criteria could be established as the basis for consistent\nassessments of the risks and rewards. In addition, the weighting of various risks and rewards was seen to be\nproblematic. The Board also noted the IASB has progressively been moving away from the risks and\nrewards approach to focus on the concept of control when determining what assets should be recognised (eg\nAASB 10 and AASB 16 have a primary focus on control, with risks and rewards a secondary\nconsideration). The Board also considered its transaction neutrality approach and noted the risks and\nrewards approach would be inconsistent with the principles in AASB Interpretation 12. The Board\nconcluded that the risks and rewards approach was not appropriate for an Australian Accounting Standard\naddressing grantor accounting for service concession arrangements.  \nBC24 In considering the rights and obligations approach, the Board noted that although this could have conceptual\nmerit, it would represent a significant change in the accounting for and financial reporting of assets and\nliabilities for public sector entities that could have implications beyond service concession arrangements.\nThe Board concluded that the rights and obligations approach was not appropriate at this time for an\nAustralian Accounting Standard addressing grantor accounting for service concession arrangements.  \nBC25 The Board discussed application of the concept of control in AASB 10 by analogous interpretation, and\ndecided that the principles for assessing control of an entity may not necessarily be appropriate for assessing\ncontrol of an individual asset.  \nBC26 The Board concluded that the IPSAS 32 approach (the control or regulation approach) was the most\nappropriate approach as it is consistent with AASB Interpretation 12. Accordingly, this approach would\nlead to greater consistency in the accounting requirements for the operator and the grantor. The Board noted  \n-----  that this approach would require both the operator and the grantor under a service concession arrangement\nto apply the same principles in determining which party should recognise the asset in the arrangement. The\nBoard considered that this approach would reduce the possibility of an asset being recognised by both\nparties, or by neither party to the arrangement.  \nBC27 The Board noted that the IPSASB confirmed the control approach in IPSAS 32 in the Basis for Conclusions\nto The Conceptual Framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting by Public Sector Entities (October\n2014), where the IPSASB concluded that consideration of \u201cthe risks and rewards associated with particular\ntransactions and events, and which party to any transaction or event bears the majority of those risks and\nrewards, may be relevant and useful in identifying the nature of the asset controlled by parties to the\ntransaction or event. It may also be useful in determining how to quantify and associate the economic rights\nand obligations with particular parties. However, it is not of itself an indicator of the party that controls an\nasset. The IPSASB therefore decided not to include the risks and rewards of ownership as an indicator of\ncontrol\u201d (paragraph BC5.14).  \nBC28 In considering the concept of control for the recognition of service concession assets, the Board decided that\nthe grantor recognises an asset provided by the operator and an upgrade to or major component replacement\nof an existing asset of the grantor provided by the operator as a service concession asset if the grantor\ncontrols the asset. The grantor essentially controls the asset if the grantor satisfies the specific control\ncriteria in paragraphs 5(a) and (b): the grantor \u201ccontrols or regulates what services the operator must\nprovide with the asset, to whom it must provide them, and at what price\u201d and controls the residual value (if\nsignificant), thus controlling the asset for the majority of its economic life. This mirrors the control concept\nin AASB Interpretation 12. The Board noted that a broader concept of control currently applies in other\nAccounting Standards and that an asset that does not meet the control definition of this Standard may still\nneed to be recognised under other Accounting Standards. The Board decided to include application\nguidance to make explicit the requirement to apply the broader concept of control.",

The three main circumstances are where the\nservice concession contract:  \n(a) _specifies that the grantor controls or regulates the price, the services and/or to whom the services_\nmust be provided;  \n(b) _specifies that a third-party regulator regulates the price, the services and/or to whom the services_\nmust be provided \u2013 under this circumstance, the regulation by the third-party regulator removes\nthe ability of the operator to set or regulate the price, the services and/or to whom the services\nmust be provided and the regulation is considered to be set implicitly by the grantor.\nAdditionally, it is not essential for the grantor to direct the activities of the third-party regulator\nfor the grantor to have control over the service concession arrangements (paragraph B20); and  \n(c) _does not specify that a third-party regulator regulates the price, the services and/or to whom the_\nservices must be provided \u2013 under these circumstances, many governments have the power to\nregulate the behaviour of entities operating in certain sectors of the economy, either directly or\nthrough specifically created agencies. For the purpose of paragraph 5(a), such broad regulatory\npowers do not constitute control without a specific arrangement or contract (paragraph B21).\nInstead the grantor, operating under such a regulatory framework, derives control of the service\nconcession asset either from the contract or the specific regulation applicable to the industry or\nservice. However, where a service concession arrangement does not clearly fall within an existing\nregulatory framework (eg where there is more than one possible source of regulation), the\narrangement will need to incorporate the specific regulatory framework that stipulates the\nservices, the users and/or the pricing to be charged for the services in order for the grantor to have\ncontrol of the service concession asset (paragraph B22).  \nBC30 The Board decided that the circumstances noted in the preceding paragraph should form part of the\napplication guidance to assist entities in assessing whether the service concession asset is controlled by the\ngrantor.  \nBC31 The Board deliberated whether long-term arrangements, privatisation and outsourcing arrangements should\nbe scoped out of the requirements of the Standard, or whether they should be assessed to determine whether\nthey meet the control criteria of paragraphs 5 or 6 of the Standard. The Board decided that where the\narrangements meet the criteria of paragraphs 5 or 6, the arrangements should be accounted for as service\nconcession arrangements. This approach would ensure the substance of an arrangement determines whether\nthe arrangement is subject to this Standard.  \n-----  ",

The judgement should be based on\nsubstance rather than form: for example, any residual interest is not necessarily a significant\nresidual interest; and  \n(b) the term \u2018significant\u2019 is used in numerous Standards without specific guidance as to what would\nconstitute \u2018significant\u2019. The Board did not consider specific guidance on the term would be\nappropriate in this Standard. If the Board were to provide guidance on the term, the Board may\nneed to refer the matter to the IASB for consideration with reference to maintaining compliance\nwith IFRS Standards. Consideration by the IASB on this issue would most likely have\nimplications beyond service concession arrangements.  \nBC35 This Standard requires the residual interest in the asset to be measured as the estimated fair value (current\nreplacement cost) of the asset as if it were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of the\nservice concession arrangement. The Board considered whether guidance should be provided in\ndetermining \u2018fair value\u2019 and its relationship to the asset\u2019s residual interest, and concluded it was not\nnecessary to provide additional guidance (see paragraph BC69).  \nBC36 The Board also considered the relationship between \u2018significant residual interest\u2019 and a \u2018whole-of-life\u2019 asset\nin determining whether the grantor has control of an asset. The Board decided that if the term of the service\nconcession arrangement:  \n(a) is not the economic life of the asset, then paragraph 5 of the Standard applies; or  \n(b) is the economic life of the asset, then paragraph 6 of the Standard applies.  \nThe Board noted this is consistent with the general observation that the amount of residual interest at the\nend of an arrangement is inversely related to the term of the service concession arrangement relative to the\neconomic life of the asset. That is, the residual interest at the end of the arrangement is likely to be\nsignificant if the term of the arrangement is not at least the majority portion of the economic life of the\nasset. Consequently, such an arrangement would be subject to paragraphs 5(a) and (b). Alternatively, where\nthe residual interest is insignificant, the arrangement would be subject either to paragraph 5(a) or, for a\nwhole-of-life asset, paragraph 6.  \nBC37 Paragraph 6 of this Standard requires the grantor to recognise an asset that will be used in a service\nconcession arrangement for its economic life (a whole-of-life asset) if the conditions in paragraph 5(a) are\nmet. The Board decided to use the term \u2018economic life\u2019 instead of \u2018useful life\u2019 as proposed in ED 261\n(paragraph 9). The economic life of an asset is the period over which future economic benefits are expected\nfrom all possible users of the asset, and may be the entire physical life of the asset. Consequently, an asset\nused in a service concession arrangement for its economic life will not have a significant residual interest at\nthe end of the arrangement, and the condition in paragraph 5(b) will not be relevant. This contrasts with the\nterm \u2018useful life\u2019, which is defined in AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment as the period over which\nan asset is expected to be available for use by an entity. An asset used in a service concession arrangement\nfor its useful life (to the grantor) could have a significant residual interest at the end of the arrangement if\nthe arrangement is not for all or the major part of its economic life. In this case, the condition in\nparagraph 5(b) would be relevant, and paragraph 6 is not applicable.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Intangible assets  \nBC39 The Board considered whether the requirement in paragraph 8 that the grantor reclassify and measure an\nexisting asset that is used in a service concession arrangement should apply to an identifiable intangible\nasset that has not been recognised previously by the grantor. The intangible asset would not have been\nrecognised previously if the asset did not meet the criteria of AASB 138 Intangible Assets for recognition as\nan intangible asset. The Board decided that AASB 1059 should override AASB 138 and require a grantor to\nrecognise and measure an existing but unrecognised identifiable intangible asset when the conditions in\nparagraph 5 or 6 for recognition as a service concession asset are met. This would apply even to intangible\nassets that are specifically precluded from recognition under paragraph 63 of AASB 138: internally\ngenerated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance. The\naccounting for intangible assets of the grantor that are part of a service concession arrangement is set out in\nparagraphs B38\u2013B39.  \nBC40 The Board took the view that a service concession arrangement represents a transaction with an external\nparty that identifies and values all identifiable assets involved in the arrangement. Therefore, with the\nexception of goodwill (see paragraph BC42), the accounting should be similar to that for business\ncombinations under AASB 3 _Business Combinations, in which all assets and liabilities acquired are_\nrecognised, including those not previously recognised by the acquiree. This approach means that intangible\nassets encompassed by a service concession arrangement should be recognised by the grantor as intangible\nservice concession assets (when the conditions in paragraph 5 or 6 are met), regardless of whether the assets\nwere already recognised by the grantor as intangible assets.  \nBC41 The Board considered whether the recognition of previously unrecognised intangible assets as service\nconcession assets should result in revenue for the grantor. The Board decided that the recognition of\nrevenue would not be appropriate since the grantor is not obtaining control of such assets for the first time,\nbut continues to control such assets. Instead, the Board concluded that the recognition is like a\nremeasurement of the assets, with a corresponding adjustment to revaluation surplus. This aligns with the\ngrantor recognising a liability in respect of service concession assets provided by the operator, since the\ngrantor obtains control of those assets only through the service concession arrangement. Those liabilities are\nreduced as revenue is recognised in accordance with the substance of the arrangement.  \nBC42 The Board noted that a service concession arrangement might encompass a business of the grantor, as\ndefined in AASB 3. This raised the issue of whether the grantor should recognise internally generated\ngoodwill as an asset of the business. The Board considered whether to follow the approach in AASB 3 and\nrequire goodwill to be recognised by the grantor. Under this approach, the grantor would measure the\nbusiness at fair value (current replacement cost) and allocate this amount to the identifiable assets (such as\nproperty, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets) in the business, measured at their fair value\n(current replacement cost), with the remaining amount allocated to internally generated goodwill after\nrecognising any liabilities of the business.  \nBC43 The Board acknowledged the conceptual merit in applying the AASB 3 approach to identify the assets for\nrecognition in a service concession arrangement, in that the grantor has provided the operator with the right\nto access the whole business (including any goodwill) for the purpose of providing public services.\nHowever, the Board noted that this approach would give rise to difficulties in subsequently assessing\ngoodwill annually for impairment under AASB 136 _Impairment of Assets, since the revenue to be_\nrecognised by the grantor under the service concession arrangement would be limited to the related\nliabilities recognised, rather than reflecting cash flows of the service concession assets. The Board\nconcluded that the approach in AASB 3 would be difficult to apply in practice, with the costs likely to\noutweigh the benefits. Consequently, the Board decided not to apply the approach in AASB 3. Instead, the\ngrantor is required by AASB 1059 to recognise only the tangible assets and intangible assets in the business,\nmeasured at fair value (current replacement cost) and liabilities of the business. Goodwill is not permitted to\nbe recognised.  \n-----  BC44 The Board considered that at the end of a service concession arrangement an intangible service concession\nasset should continue to be recognised as an intangible asset and accounted for in accordance with\nAASB 138, excluding the recognition criteria of AASB 138. The Board decided that AASB 1059 would\noverride the recognition criteria of AASB 138, so that an intangible asset would not be derecognised at the\nend of the service concession arrangement merely because it could not satisfy the recognition requirements\nof AASB 138. However, the derecognition criteria in AASB 138 would apply, so that the grantor would be\nrequired to derecognise the intangible asset if the grantor loses control of the asset.",

        "page_content=": "## Characteristics of the asset  \nBC48 In considering the characteristics of the asset when measuring fair value, the Board noted AASB 13 requires\nthe grantor to consider the characteristics of the service concession asset that market participants would take\ninto account when pricing the asset at the measurement date. Characteristics include the condition and\nlocation of the asset as well as any restrictions on the sale, transfer or use of the asset. The effect of\nrestrictions on the sale, transfer or use of the service concession asset depends on whether the restriction is\ndeemed to be a characteristic of the asset or a characteristic of the grantor that controls the asset. Where a\nrestriction would transfer with the asset in an assumed sale or transfer, the restriction would generally be\nregarded as a characteristic of the asset and likely to be considered by a market participant in pricing the\nasset. On the other hand, a restriction that is specific to the grantor and that would not transfer with the asset\nin an assumed sale would not be considered in measuring the fair value of the asset. Whether a restriction is\na characteristic of the service concession asset or specific to the grantor requires judgement based on the\nspecific facts and circumstances of the arrangement.  \nBC49 A market participant may consider that the right of access provided by the grantor to the operator does not\nrepresent a restriction on the grantor\u2019s use of the asset. In a service concession arrangement, control of the\nasset and therefore the right to use the asset is retained by the grantor (and transferred to the market\nparticipant in a hypothetical transaction). Under this view, the right of access provided to the operator\nwould not represent a restriction on the use of the asset.  \nBC50 The assessment of restrictions is important for service concession arrangements involving the grant of a\nright to the operator (GORTO) model, where the grantor provides the operator with a right to charge the\nusers of the service concession asset. To the extent that a market participant (acting in its economic best\ninterest) would take into account in measuring the fair value of the asset the fact that a third-party operator\nhas been granted a right to charge users, this could result in a different fair value compared to that for an\nequivalent asset without such a characteristic, such as the service concession asset under an arrangement\nthat involves only the financial liability model. In the latter case, any obligation to pay the operator under\nthe financial liability model that would be transferred to the market participant would be separately\nrecognised, not netted against the asset.  \n-----  BC51 The Board discussed the unit of account in AASB 13, which defines it as the level at which an asset or a\nliability is aggregated or disaggregated in a Standard for recognition purposes. The Board noted there are\nthree possible bases for identifying a service concession asset: the service concession period, the economic\nlife after the end of the arrangement (the residual), or both the concession period and any remaining\neconomic life.  \nBC52 The Board noted some may view the grant of a right to the operator to earn revenue from third-party users\nof the asset means that the grantor\u2019s service concession asset is only the residual interest in the asset after\nthe service concession period. Under this view, the grantor\u2019s interest in the service concession period\ncomponent of the asset is effectively derecognised, consistent with a rights and obligations approach.  \nBC53 In the development of IFRIC 12, the IFRIC decided that when the operator in a service concession\narrangement does not have the right to control the underlying use of the asset, the operator instead has\naccess to operate the asset to provide a service on behalf of the grantor. In essence, the operator acts as a\nservice provider (IFRIC 12, paragraphs BC24\u2013BC25). Accordingly, it is the grantor that has control of the\nunderlying use of the asset during both the service concession period and any residual period thereafter. The\nBoard therefore concluded the unit of account is the entire service concession asset, not just the residual\ninterest after the service concession arrangement ends.",

        "page_content=": "### Income approach\nBC56 The income approach converts future amounts (eg cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current\n(ie discounted) amount. When the income approach is used, the fair value measurement reflects current\nmarket expectations about those future amounts (AASB 13, paragraph B10).  \nBC57 Service concession assets are used to provide goods or services to achieve public service objectives and\nconsequently the prices that might be charged for those goods or services may be regulated. Price regulation\nwould have the effect of restricting the future cash flows that could be obtained from the assets. The fees the\noperator can charge users may be at a significant discount and hence this would not reflect the fair value of\nthe asset based on what a market participant may choose to charge under commercial terms. Service\npotential (ie capacity to provide future services) rather than future economic benefits (ie future cash flows)\nis likely to drive decisions regarding service concession assets.  \nBC58 The Board considered whether the grantor\u2019s contractual obligation to make a predetermined payment or\nseries of payments to the operator under the financial liability model could be a measure of the fair value of\nthe asset. Where the grantor\u2019s payments to the operator represent the price that the operator expects for the\nconstruction, development, acquisition or upgrade of a service concession asset based on the expectations of\nthe cash flows which could be generated by the asset, this method may be appropriate for determining fair\nvalue at initial recognition as a surrogate for the income approach. However, the cash payments promised to\nthe operator under the financial liability model might have no direct relationship to the cash flows expected\nto be generated from the asset (for example, the grantor may choose not to charge users) and the income\napproach would not be appropriate.  \n-----  BC59 The Board noted some may view the grant of a right to the operator to earn revenue from third-party users\nof the asset as a restriction that a market participant would recognise when using the income approach (see\nalso paragraph BC50). Under this view, the asset should be measured only in relation to the service\npotential of the asset after the service concession period has expired, ie at the fair value of the residual\ninterest in the asset (see also paragraphs BC52\u2013BC53). This is on the basis that the market participant buyer\nwill not have the right to all the cash flows that could be generated by the asset as the right to the cash flows\nfor the service concession period has been granted to the operator (effectively the service concession period\ncomponent of the asset would be derecognised). Under this view, the service concession asset\u2019s fair value\nrelates only to the cash flows that can be directly generated for the grantor by the asset. Consequently, the\nfair value of the asset would be measured at the asset\u2019s residual value.  \nBC60 However, the Board noted a public sector entity uses a service concession asset\u2019s capacity or service\npotential to provide goods or services to achieve public service objectives, replacing the asset irrespective of\nwhether the replacement cost will be recovered by the expected cash flows that the asset may generate. The\nBoard also noted the view that the service potential of a service concession asset (such as a road) under a\nservice concession arrangement involving the financial liability model and the service potential of an\nidentical asset (such as a toll road) under a service concession arrangement involving the GORTO model is\nthe same from the grantor\u2019s perspective as both assets will provide the same utility to the public. Under this\nview, the fair value of these assets should therefore be measured consistently. The Board concluded that the\nfair value of the asset would be understated if it was measured at the fair value of the residual interest in the\nasset.  \nBC61 The Board also noted its decision to recognise, under the GORTO model, a contract liability that is initially\nrecognised and then reduced as revenue is recognised (see paragraphs B71\u2013B72 and BC80). The Board\nconsidered whether the amortisation profile of the contract liability should be determined so that the net\nbalance of the service concession asset and the contract liability approximates the fair value of the residual\ninterest in the asset. Whilst this would effectively mean a more consistent outcome with the financial\nliability model, the Board considered this approach would be practically difficult, with the costs likely to\noutweigh the benefits. The Board also expected that in many instances there would not be a material\ndifference between this net approach and amortisation of the liability on a time basis. The Board therefore\nconcluded that this approach was not appropriate.",

        "page_content=": "### Cost approach\nBC62 The cost approach \u201creflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of\nan asset (often referred to as current replacement cost)\u201d (AASB 13, paragraph B8). This approach uses\nLevel 2 and/or Level 3 inputs, which are observable or unobservable inputs. Current replacement cost is the\n\u201ccost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted\nfor obsolescence\u201d (AASB 13, paragraph B9). The Board noted that current replacement cost is often used to\nmeasure the fair value of assets that are used in combination with other assets or with other assets and\nliabilities. This is particularly relevant if the service concession asset is part of an integrated network of\nassets, such as the provision of a transport network.  \nBC63 The Board noted (in paragraph BC60) a public sector entity uses a service concession asset\u2019s capacity or\nservice potential to provide goods or services to achieve public service objectives, replacing the asset\nirrespective of whether the replacement cost will be recovered by the expected cash flows that the asset may\ngenerate. This view would be consistent with measuring the asset using current replacement cost under the\ncost approach in AASB 13.  \nBC64 Additionally the Board\u2019s view (in paragraph BC60) is that the service potential of a service concession asset\nunder a service concession arrangement involving the financial liability model and the service potential of\nan identical asset involving the GORTO model is the same from the grantor\u2019s perspective, as both assets\nwill provide the same utility to the public. The fair value of these assets should therefore be measured\nconsistently.  \nBC65 Unlike the other valuation methodologies, current replacement cost would result in the same value under\nboth the financial liability model and the GORTO model. Current replacement cost would not include the\nrestriction on the asset (see paragraph BC49) of the grantor having granted the operator the right to charge\nusers as the restriction relates to future cash flows from the asset rather than the costs to replace the asset to\nprovide its current service potential. The Board\u2019s considerations of whether the granting of the right to\nfuture cash flows should be recognised as a separate liability are set out in paragraphs BC79\u2013BC80.  \nBC66 The Board concluded a service concession asset is an asset that is obtained through construction,\ndevelopment, acquisition, upgrade or replacement of a major component of an asset. The asset\u2019s capacity or\nservice potential is used to achieve public service objectives irrespective of whether the cost of the asset\nwill be recovered by the expected cash flows that the asset may generate. The Board therefore concluded  \n-----  that it is appropriate to initially measure service concession assets at fair value using only current\nreplacement cost under the cost approach to fair value. The Board noted that this approach applies to forprofit public sector grantors as well as to not-for-profit public sector grantors, given the objective of the\nStandard. The Board preferred the same measurement basis for all public sector grantors, even though it is\npossible that a for-profit grantor might hold service concession assets for both their service potential and\ntheir future cash flows.",

The Board concluded the reclassification of the grantor\u2019s existing asset represents a change in\nthe nature of the asset (even an intangible asset) to a service concession asset and should therefore be\nmeasured on the same basis as a service concession asset acquired through the operator.  \nBC68 The Board acknowledged the requirement for a grantor to initially measure a service concession asset at fair\nvalue (current replacement cost) in accordance with the cost approach in AASB 13 may result in a for-profit\ngrantor not being able to state that its financial statements comply with IFRS Standards. This is because\nAASB 13 (and the corresponding IFRS 13 _Fair Value Measurement) permits other valuation techniques_\n(see paragraphs BC124\u2013BC125).  \nBC69 The Board decided not to provide additional guidance on the measurement of a service concession asset on\nthe grounds that this would best be developed in the future through a separate project on the measurement\nof public sector assets. The Board also considered whether the Standard should include additional guidance\nin the following areas and decided there is sufficient guidance in the Standard and/or other Standards:  \n(a) determination of the fair value of a partly constructed asset \u2013 the Board noted there is a broad\nrange of techniques in AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers that, depending on the\nnature of the contract, could be used to establish the fair value of a partly constructed asset;  \n(b) the valuation approach for intangible service concession assets \u2013 the Board decided intangible\nservice concession assets should not be treated differently from tangible service concession assets\non initial recognition. In both cases, the asset\u2019s capacity or service potential is used to achieve\npublic service objectives irrespective of whether the cost of the asset will be recovered by the\nexpected cash flows that the asset may generate. Consequently, the measurement of the asset at\ninitial recognition should not be affected by whether the service concession asset is a tangible or\nintangible asset; and  \n(c) accounting for economic obsolescence in determining the fair value of the asset \u2013 as noted in\nparagraph BC66, the Board concluded that the fair value of a service concession asset should be\nmeasured using the cost approach. The cost approach (the current replacement cost) reflects the\namount required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset. Current replacement cost\ntakes obsolescence into consideration. AASB 13 provides examples of obsolescence, such as\nphysical deterioration, functional (technological) obsolescence and economic (external)\nobsolescence, and notes that it is broader than depreciation.",

        "page_content=": "## Recognition and measurement of a liability  \nFinancial liability model  \nBC71 The Board considered issues relating to the recognition of a financial liability and, consistent with the key\nprinciples of IPSAS 32, decided that a financial liability should be recognised when the grantor has a\ncontractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to the operator.  \n-----  BC72 A financial liability arises when the grantor is obligated to make a determinable payment or series of\npayments to the operator. The Board agreed with the IPSASB conclusion that when there is a determinable\npayment or series of payments of cash or cash equivalents, the payments should be allocated as a reduction\nof the liability, an imputed finance charge (if any), and charges for services provided by the operator under\nthe service concession arrangement. The Board determined that wherever possible the existing guidance in\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments should apply.  \nBC73 The Board considered whether a financial liability arises when an arrangement requires the grantor to make\npayments to the operator based on third-party usage of the service concession asset without guaranteeing a\nminimum amount to the operator. The Board considered the application of the financial liability model to\nthis case by assessing the notion that the grantor may not have a contractual obligation to pay the operator\nspecified or determinable amounts at the inception of the arrangement as specified in paragraph 15. As\nnoted in paragraph B63, the grantor has a financial liability if it does not have an unconditional ability to\navoid the obligation to make the payments to the operator. The grantor is not able to avoid the payments as\nit cannot control the usage of the service concession asset by third parties, and any attempt to restrict usage\nmay result in penalties under the arrangement. The amounts payable by the grantor to the operator are\ncontingent upon the level of third-party usage of the service concession asset. Paragraph 25 of AASB 132\n_Financial Instruments: Presentation affirms this view that a grantor may have a contractual obligation in_\nthe form of a financial liability when the amounts are not specified or determinable at inception but are\ncontingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events. The Board also decided that\nAASB 9 should be applied to the accounting for the financial liability subsequent to its initial recognition.\nAccordingly, the Board decided that, for the arrangement under consideration, the financial liability model\nshould be applied (as set out in paragraph 16(a)), with the financial liability initially recognised at the same\namount as the fair value of the service concession asset, and the grantor applying AASB 9 subsequently to\nthe accounting for the financial liability. The Board noted this view is consistent with its decision to not\ninclude in ED 261 or AASB 1059 the guidance in paragraph AG49 of IPSAS 32 relating to treating shadow\ntolls payable by the grantor as payments for the usage and not the acquisition of the service concession\nasset.  \nBC74 The Board noted that the approach described in paragraph BC73 may result in asymmetry in accounting for\nthe same arrangement by the operator. This is due to AASB Interpretation 12 (paragraph 16) permitting the\noperator to recognise a financial asset only to the extent that it has an unconditional present right to receive\ncash from or at the direction of the grantor. The operator has an unconditional contractual right to receive\ncash if the grantor contractually guarantees the operator\u2019s cash flows. In the absence of a guarantee from the\ngrantor, the operator\u2019s contractual right is conditional on third-party usage of the service concession asset,\nand the operator recognises an intangible asset rather than a financial asset. The Board concluded the\nprinciples appropriate to this Standard are more important than achieving symmetry in accounting by the\nparties to the service concession arrangement.  \nBC75 Consistent with AASB Interpretation 12, this Standard requires the application of the financial instrument\nStandards to the financial liability recognised under paragraph 11, except where this Standard requires\notherwise. In deliberating the application of the financial instrument Standards to the recognition of a\nfinancial liability, the Board considered the following:  \n(a) whether the financial liability should be measured in accordance with AASB 9 rather than\nmeasured initially at the same amount as the service concession asset (current replacement cost).\nThe Board noted that consistent with AASB 9 there is no day-one gain or loss to be recognised,\nand concluded that the costs of separately measuring the fair value of the financial liability would\noutweigh the benefits of doing so;  \n(b) whether to retain, in paragraph 18, the requirement proposed in ED 261 that the grantor allocates\nthe payments to the operator under the contract and accounts separately for the finance charge.\nThe Board noted this proposed requirement would apply if the financial liability is subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost in accordance with AASB 9. However, AASB 9 permits other\nmethods in the subsequent measurement of a financial liability, such as fair value through profit\nor loss. The subsequent measurement of a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss\nwould not require separate accounting for a finance charge. The Board decided, given AASB 9\naddresses the separate accounting for a finance charge, it is sufficient for AASB 1059 to refer to\nthe financial instrument Standards in this respect without providing additional guidance;  \n(c) whether to retain the guidance proposed in ED 261 relating to the appropriate interest rate for\ndetermining the finance charge (if any). The Board decided to replace the reference in ED 261 to\ndetermining the finance charge using the rate implicit in the arrangement. The Standard\n(paragraph B67) instead refers to determining the finance charge using the effective interest\nmethod when the financial liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost in accordance\nwith AASB 9; and  \n-----  (d) whether to include guidance relating to the appropriate interest rate for initially measuring the\nfinancial liability component in a hybrid arrangement, since the financial liability component is\nmeasured first, and an interest rate is needed in order to discount the expected future cash flows to\na present value. The Board decided to include application guidance (see paragraph B64) that the\ngrantor shall, in the first instance, use the contractually specified interest rate in the arrangement\nto initially measure the financial liability component of a hybrid arrangement in accordance with\nAASB 9. If it is not practicable to determine the contractually specified interest rate, the grantor\nwould determine the appropriate rate using the prevailing market rate(s) of interest for a similar\ninstrument with a similar credit rating, following the requirements of AASB 9. Examples of rates\nfor a similar instrument include the operator\u2019s cost of capital specific to the service concession\nasset, the grantor\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, or another rate appropriate to the terms and\nconditions of the arrangement.",

        "page_content=": "## Grant of a right to the operator (GORTO) model  \nBC76 The GORTO model applies when the grantor grants the operator the right to earn revenue from third-party\nusers of the service concession asset. Under the GORTO model, the grantor transfers to the operator an\nintangible asset (being a right to charge users of the service concession asset) in exchange for the\nconstruction, development, acquisition or upgrade of a service concession asset and the provision of related\nfuture services. The Board considered whether the grantor should initially recognise revenue or a liability\nwhen it obtains control of the service concession asset arising from a service concession arrangement. The\nBoard noted that IPSAS 32 requires a grantor to initially recognise a liability when the grantor recognises\nthe service concession asset. Given its policy of transaction neutrality, the Board considered whether the\nrequirements of Australian Accounting Standards, specifically the application of AASB 15 either directly or\nby analogy, would support:  \n(a) the recognition of a liability (consistent with IPSAS 32); or  \n(b) the recognition of revenue on the basis that the grantor has no remaining obligations to the\noperator once it has transferred to the operator the right to charge users.  \nBC77 The Board concluded that, from a grantor\u2019s perspective, the application of AASB 15 without further\nguidance may lead to divergence in accounting for a service concession arrangement, as significant\njudgement would be required to determine whether a service concession arrangement in which the grantor\ntransfers an intangible asset to the operator is within the scope of AASB 15. The Board noted differing\nviews on whether a service concession arrangement involves a contract with a customer (ie whether the\nright to charge users is considered a licence, whether the operator is considered a customer, or whether the\nordinary activities of government include undertaking service concession arrangements as a grantor), and\ndepending on the specific facts and circumstances some service concession arrangements might be a rightof-use licence and others a right of access. The Board preferred the view that the substance of the\ntransaction appears more akin to financing the construction of the service concession asset, rather than a\ncontract with a customer.  \nBC78 The Board also noted, in a service concession arrangement, the grantor makes promises, either explicitly or\nimplicitly, to undertake activities in relation to the service concession asset that will benefit the operator.\nThis reflects the fact that a service concession asset is controlled and managed by the grantor to provide\npublic services. The Board acknowledged that the grantor\u2019s promise, or the operator\u2019s expectation, that the\ngrantor will undertake activities that benefit the operator may in some instances be comparable to promises\nmade by a licensor or expectations of a licensee that the licensor will undertake activities in relation to\nintellectual property that will benefit the licensee. AASB 15 identifies such licences as licences that provide\nthe licensee with a right to access the underlying intellectual property. AASB 15 specifies that the promise\nof a right to access intellectual property is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and the\nlicensor would recognise a contract liability for its remaining performance obligation to provide access.  \nBC79 The Board decided that facts and circumstances would need to be assessed for each arrangement to\ndetermine whether the arrangement represented a right-of-access licence or a right-of-use licence. The\nBoard preferred all service concession arrangements to be treated the same way, as it did not see the\nsubstance of service concession arrangements being different in respect to commitments under the\narrangements. The Board also noted that recognising revenue immediately on a service concession asset\nthat would otherwise be considered loss making from a cashflow perspective would not reflect the\neconomic substance of the arrangement and would overstate current year financial performance. The Board\nfurther noted that immediate recognition of revenue (rather than a liability) would result in overstatement of\nthe financial position as the requirement to use current replacement cost as fair value recognises the asset in\nfull, even though the right to charge users of the asset has been transferred to the operator.  \n-----  BC80 Consequently, the Board concluded the grantor\u2019s promises to undertake activities in relation to the service\nconcession asset that will benefit the operator should also be accounted similarly to a contract liability. The\ngrantor would subsequently recognise revenue as the \u2018access\u2019 is provided to the operator over the service\nconcession period.  \nBC81 In some service concession arrangements, the right to charge users is described as a licence. The Board\nnoted that accounting for licences other than those relating to service concession arrangements should be\nsubject to further research to inform the Board as to whether a separate project would be required.\nDetermining whether a particular licence granted by a government is within the scope of AASB 15 would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances.  \nBC82 Given the importance of service concession arrangements to governments and the lack of accounting\nguidance for such arrangements in the absence of AASB 1059, the Board decided that service concession\narrangements should be treated separately from other licences granted by governments.  \nBC83 The Board considered whether the Standard should include additional guidance on the principle-based\napproach to recognising revenue under the GORTO model. The Standard (paragraph 22) specifies that the\ngrantor recognises revenue and reduces the GORTO liability according to the economic substance of the\narrangement. The Board assessed the following options of whether to:  \n(a) require revenue to be recognised on a systematic and rational basis using the straight-line method.\nThis option would eliminate divergent approaches to recognising revenue but would not be\nconsistent with the objective of the Board to develop a principle-based accounting standard; or  \n(b) not provide additional guidance in the final Standard on the basis there is sufficient guidance in\nthe Standard. Paragraph B71 requires revenue to be recognised and the liability reduced based on\nthe economic substance of the arrangement, usually as access to the service concession asset is\nprovided to the operator over the term of the service concession arrangement.  \nBC84 The Board decided not to add additional guidance. Revenue recognition should be based on the economic\nsubstance of the specific arrangement as assessed by the grantor and should not be prescribed by the Board.",

        "page_content=": "## Other liability recognition and measurement models  \nBC85 The Board considered the following alternative recognition and measurement models to the GORTO model:  \n(a) applying the financial liability model to all service concession arrangements;  \n(b) accounting for the assets of the arrangement and not the right to charge users for the use of the\nservice concession asset that has been granted by the grantor to the operator; and  \n(c) application of AASB 140 Investment Property by analogy.  \nBC86 In analysing whether the financial liability model could be applied to all service concession arrangements,\nthe Board considered:  \n(a) whether the nature of the party (the grantor or the users of the service concession asset) that\nmakes the payment to the operator determines the accounting model for the grantor to recognise a\nservice concession liability. Consistent with AASB Interpretation 12, the Board concluded the\nparty that has the responsibility to make payments to the operator is important in determining the\naccounting model for the grantor\u2019s recognition of the liability. This view takes into account who\nbears the demand risk (ie the ability and willingness of the users to use and pay for the services).\nThis view is consistent with the models in this Standard and mirrors the requirements of AASB\nInterpretation 12. That is, under the financial liability model, the grantor is the party with the\nprimary responsibility to make payments to the operator for the services. This contrasts with the\nGORTO model, where the operator is the party that bears the demand risks. Accordingly, the use\nof different models (ie the financial liability model and the GORTO model) to account for the\nliability is more appropriate; and  \n(b) whether the grantor has a financial liability when the operator has been granted the right to charge\nthird-party users for the use of the asset. The Board concluded that the grantor does not have a\nfinancial liability under GORTO arrangements. That is, the grantor does not have a contractual\nobligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to the operator nor exchange financial assets\nor financial liabilities with the operator under potentially unfavourable conditions.  \nBC87 The Board considered whether the more appropriate approach under the GORTO model is to recognise only\nthe cash flows that the service concession asset can generate directly (the residual cash flows to the grantor).\nThe implication is that the fair value of the asset could be measured at the asset\u2019s residual value (which\ncould be zero), excluding the cash flows generated by the asset that have been granted to the operator.\nHowever, the Board concluded that the fair value of the asset should be measured using the current  \n-----  replacement cost under the cost approach irrespective of whether the cost of replacing the asset will be\nrecovered by the expected cash flows that the asset may generate (see paragraphs BC63\u2013BC66). In addition,\nthe grantor would recognise a GORTO contract liability (see paragraphs BC79\u2013BC80).  \nBC88 The Board also considered the application of AASB 140 by analogy to address the implication of measuring\nthe asset\u2019s fair value based on only the cash flows that are directly generated by the service concession asset\nfor the grantor. Although this approach might be appropriate under AASB 13, the resulting fair value of the\nservice concession asset would be understated in relation to the service concession arrangement. The\napplication of AASB 140 by analogy attempts to overcome this.  \nBC89 Under AASB 140, the fair value of investment property reflects expected future cash flows, including any\nfuture rental receipts. AASB 140 (paragraph 50) makes clear that in determining the carrying amount of\ninvestment property under the fair value model, it is necessary to avoid double-counting assets or liabilities\nthat are recognised separately, such as prepaid or accrued rental income and lease incentives. In such cases,\nthe fair value (carrying amount) of the investment property is adjusted so that in total the combination of all\nrelated amounts gives the fair value of the investment property.  \nBC90 The Board considered that to apply the AASB 140 approach to the GORTO model, the fair value of the\nservice concession asset would first be determined on a gross basis (ie current replacement cost for the full\nservice potential of the asset). Then a GORTO contract liability would be recognised, so that in total the\ncombination of the service concession asset and the liability would give on a net basis the appropriate\nmeasure of the service concession asset, reflecting the cash flows expected to be generated for the grantor.\nThis approach would avoid measuring the service concession asset at a net amount, such as the residual\nvalue of the asset.  \nBC91 However, the Board decided that the investment property model should not be applied by analogy. The\nBoard concluded (see paragraph BC66) that service concession assets should be measured at fair value\n(current replacement cost) in relation to the service potential of the asset, rather than reflecting only the\nexpected future cash flows for the grantor.",

        "page_content=": "## Dividing an arrangement  \nBC92 In response to constituents\u2019 comments, the Board decided to revise the approach to dividing a hybrid\narrangement that had been proposed in ED 261. Instead of noting that each component of the service\nconcession liability should be measured at fair value, the Standard requires that:  \n(a) the liability recognised under a hybrid arrangement is initially measured at the same amount as\nthe fair value (current replacement cost) of the service concession asset; and  \n(b) the method for dividing the liability under a hybrid arrangement is to determine the financial\nliability part of the liability first, with the remainder of the fair value (current replacement cost) of\nthe service concession asset allocated to the part related to the grant of the right to the operator.  \nBC93 The Board, in making the decision in paragraph BC92(b), considered whether the amounts allocated to the\nfinancial liability and the GORTO liability should depend on the entity\u2019s ability to determine the fair value\nof the service concession asset to be accounted for in relation to each liability model in the hybrid\narrangement. For example, if the fair value of the service concession asset related to the grant of the right to\nthe operator could be reliably determined, a method of dividing the hybrid arrangement might be to allocate\nthis amount to the GORTO liability, with the remainder of the total liability to be allocated to the financial\nliability. However, the Board took the view that it would be difficult to determine fair values for the\nportions of a service concession asset related to each of the two liabilities, if it were possible. Similarly, it\nwould be difficult to determine fair values for both liabilities directly, to allow the fair value (current\nreplacement cost) of the service concession asset to be allocated to each liability based on their relative fair\nvalues, following the approach in AASB 15 to allocating the transaction price to performance obligations.\nFurthermore, since the liability is not measured directly at fair value under the financial liability model (see\nparagraph BC75), it would be inappropriate to require such measurement in relation to recognising a hybrid\narrangement.  \nBC94 The Board concluded the appropriate approach would be to measure the financial liability part of the total\nliability first, with the remainder of the total liability allocated to the GORTO part of the liability. This\napproach avoids understating the financial liability, which might occur if the GORTO liability is measured\nfirst. Overstatement of the GORTO liability would mean overstatement of the revenues recognised by the\ngrantor under the service concession arrangement. The financial liability is measured and recognised first,\neven where the service concession asset is under construction. This is illustrated in Example 8 of the\nIllustrative Examples accompanying this Standard.  \n-----  ",

Other revenues relate to compensation by the operator to the grantor\nfor access to the service concession asset by providing the grantor with a series of predetermined inflows of\nresources, including the following:  \n(a) an upfront payment or a stream of payments;  \n(b) revenue-sharing provisions;  \n(c) a reduction in a predetermined series of payments the grantor is required to make to the operator;\nand  \n(d) rent payments for providing the operator access to a revenue-generating asset.  \nBC97 The Board decided this guidance was not necessary in the Australian context as the existing revenue\nrecognition guidance in Australian Accounting Standards was sufficient.  \nBC98 In setting the requirement in paragraph 12, the Board noted deliberations by the IFRS Interpretations\nCommittee on IFRIC 12 with respect to payments by the operator to the grantor.

The IFRIC agenda decision\nnoted that where the operator recognised a financial asset under a service concession arrangement, the\noperator would account for the payments to the grantor as a reduction of the transaction price, reducing the\noperator\u2019s revenue. Under this Standard, the payments from the operator would increase the grantor\u2019s\nliability, rather than reduce the carrying amount of the service concession asset. The asset is measured at\nfair value (current replacement cost) as a fundamental principle of this Standard, in order to reflect the\nservice potential of the asset rather than future cash flows.

        "page_content=": "## Transition  \nBC101 This Standard requires an entity to apply the Standard retrospectively either in accordance with AASB 108\nor under a simplified approach from the beginning of the earliest period for which comparative information\nis presented in the financial statements (the date of initial application). The modified retrospective approach\nrequires a grantor to recognise and measure service concession assets and related liabilities at the date of\ninitial application, rather than at an earlier date.  \n-----  BC102 The general requirement in AASB 108 is that accounting policy changes should be accounted for\nretrospectively, except to the extent that retrospective application would be impracticable. The Board noted\nthat there are two aspects to retrospective application: reclassification and measurement. The Board took a\nsimilar view to the IPSASB that it will usually be practicable to determine retrospectively the appropriate\nclassification of all amounts previously included in a grantor\u2019s statement of financial position, but that\nretrospective measurement of service concession assets might not always be practicable, particularly if an\nentity has not previously recognised service concession assets and related liabilities, revenues and expenses.  \nBC103 As proposed in ED 261, the Board decided that the modified retrospective approach should be available to\ngrantors that have previously recognised service concession assets and related liabilities, as well as to\ngrantors that have not done so. This contrasts with IPSAS 32, which limits this option to grantors that have\nnot previously recognised service concession assets and liabilities. The Board concluded that since the\nretrospective restatement of service concession assets might not always be practicable, the modified\napproach would be made available to all grantors.  \nBC104 Under the modified retrospective approach (see paragraph C4 of the Standard), the deemed cost of service\nconcession assets is measured at fair value (current replacement cost) at the date of initial application. The\nBoard decided this measurement basis should also apply to assets of the grantor that are reclassified as\nservice concession assets on initial application of the Standard, thus requiring the remeasurement of such\nassets. The Board noted that this would be consistent with the requirement in paragraph 8 for grantors to\nmeasure existing assets that are reclassified as service concession assets at current replacement cost in\naccordance with the cost approach to fair value at the date of reclassification. ED 261 had not proposed any\nremeasurement for reclassified assets.  \nBC105 The Board considered the approach to the initial recognition by a grantor of previously unrecognised\nidentifiable intangible assets and land under roads as service concession assets on transition, and concluded\nthat no additional transition relief was required. A grantor may elect to apply the modified retrospective\napproach, requiring measurement of service concession assets at the date of initial application of the\nStandard, to simplify the measurement of such assets.  \nBC106 The Board decided to clarify in the Standard the approach to measuring a liability under the GORTO model\nwhen the grantor adopts the modified retrospective transition approach. The starting point is to measure the\nfair value (current replacement cost) of the service concession asset at the date of initial application, and\nthen adjust that measure to reflect that part of the term of the service concession arrangement has passed.\nThere were different views as to how to make that adjustment. The Board concluded that the adjustment\nshould reflect the remaining service concession period relative to the remaining economic life of the service\nconcession asset, on the grounds that the current measurement of the asset represented the future benefits\ninherent in the asset. The Board decided to include an example to illustrate the adjustment required.  \nBC107 The Standard requires that any net adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities is recognised\nas an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated surplus (deficiency) at the date of initial\napplication. Accordingly, the Standard requires that if the grantor elects as its accounting policy the\nrevaluation model in AASB 116 or AASB 138 (or is required to adopt that policy), any relevant adjustment\nis included in accumulated surplus (deficiency) and not revaluation surplus. The Board noted that the\namount of such an adjustment could not be used to offset future changes in the values of an asset or\nliability. This is consistent with the treatment in AASB 108 for a change in accounting policy. However,\nthis differs from the approach permitted by IPSAS 32, where such an adjustment would be included in\nrevaluation surplus.",

The Board noted that key\ndifferences between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Government Finance Statistics\n(GFS) may arise in relation to the following:  \n(a) service concession arrangement terminology \u2013 GFS refers to such arrangements as \u2018Public Private\nPartnerships\u2019 (PPP);  \n(b) assessment of whether the grantor recognises a service concession asset \u2013 assessment is based on\nthe risks and rewards approach under GFS rather than the control and regulation approach in this\nStandard;  \n(c) accounting for a service concession arrangement \u2013 the arrangement is accounted for as a finance\nlease under GFS, but with some differences to AASB 16. The difference in accounting will likely\nresult in differences between GAAP and GFS in the amounts of the assets and liabilities\nrecognised both initially and during the term of the arrangement;  \n(d) revaluation of service concession assets \u2013 GFS requires the asset to be measured using the\nrevaluation model. This Standard references AASB 116 and AASB 138, which permit the cost\nand revaluation models. AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General Government Sector_\n_Financial Reporting requires fair value measurement and the revaluation of assets consistent with_\nthe market value measurement requirements of GFS; and  \n(e) the liability recognised under the GORTO model \u2013 GFS acknowledges the GORTO model but\ndoes not provide specific accounting requirements. Instead, GFS notes most PPPs are unique and\nthe accounting is to be considered on a case by case basis.  \nBC110 The Board weighed its policy on GAAP/GFS harmonisation against its policy of transaction neutrality. The\nBoard observed that some areas of potential difference were known when developing AASB 1049. Others\nare driven by a difference in the underlying principles. Further, some differences could only be addressed\nby making changes to the underlying principles in AASB 1059.  \nBC111 On balance, the Board considered that it was not necessary to amend its decisions reflected in AASB 1059\nin order to better achieve GAAP/GFS harmonisation. The Board noted that AASB 1049 will require entities\nto identify and explain any material differences arising from different requirements in GAAP as compared\nwith GFS.",

        "page_content=": "## Options for addressing the issues  \nBC12 The Board considered four possible options for resolving the issues:  \n-  Option 1 \u2013 change the modified retrospective GORTO liability calculation method so that the liability\nis initially measured based on the current replacement cost of the service concession asset received at\nthe date of initial application adjusted to reflect the remaining concession period **relative to the total**\n**period of the arrangement, rather than relative to the remaining economic life of the service**\nconcession asset. Since this approach does not consider the economic life of the asset, this option\nwould address the two issues noted in paragraph BC8;  \n-  Option 2 \u2013 amend AASB 1059 to introduce a proxy for the \u2018remaining economic life\u2019 of the asset, for\nexample 99 years, to use in the existing modified retrospective GORTO liability calculation for assets\nwith an indefinite economic life. The Board considered that determining a proxy would be difficult and\ncould result in a rule-of-thumb that might not be a faithful representation of the substance of an\narrangement. Moreover, this option would not address the issue that for some arrangements the\nGORTO liability calculated under the modified retrospective approach might be significantly smaller\ncompared to the asset;  \n1 Note that there are two paragraphs 28(a) in The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework. The reference here is to the  \nsecond paragraph 28(a), which states \u201cthe prevalence and magnitude of NFP-specific transactions, circumstances and events results in\nNFP entities\u2019 reported performance or financial position not reflecting economic reality (eg transfers of assets at significantly less than\nfair value primarily to enable a NFP entity to achieve its objectives, and for public sector entities, the provision of social benefits and\nrelated sustainability and sovereign power issues)\u201d.  \n-----  -  Option 3 \u2013 include the calculation proposed in Option 1 as an accounting policy choice for entities.\nThat is, make available both the current modified retrospective method and the calculation proposed in\nOption 1, and provide guidance to illustrate which option to apply under which circumstances. The\nBoard noted that in finalising AASB 1059 it had mandated one calculation method so that the modified\nretrospective method would be applied consistently across entities. Introducing an optional alternative\nfor the modified retrospective method could remove that consistency and permit entities to choose a\nmethod for the purpose of achieving better budget or actual results rather than the method that best\nreflects the economic substance of the transaction; and  \n-  Option 4 \u2013 to recognise a GORTO liability at the same amount as the current replacement cost of the\nasset received on transition to AASB 1059. This method is similar to the modified transitional\napproach in transitioning operating leases under AASB 117 Leases to AASB 16. Under paragraph C8\nof AASB 16, a lessee recognises a lease liability under the Standard and has an option to recognise a\nright-of-use asset based on the amount of the lease liability on transition to AASB 16. However, the\nBoard considered that the modified retrospective method should reflect that part of the service\nconcession period has already passed.  \nBC13 The Board considered the advantages and disadvantages of each option and decided to adopt Option 1 \u2013\nchange the modified retrospective GORTO liability calculation method so that it is initially measured based\non the current replacement cost of the service concession asset at the date of initial application adjusted to\nreflect the remaining concession period **relative to the total period of the arrangement, rather than**\nrelative to the remaining economic life of the service concession asset.  \nBC14 Option 1 would result in a larger GORTO liability compared to the current modified retrospective\ncalculation method when the service concession asset has a remaining economic life longer than the total\nconcession period. The Board considered that this larger GORTO liability calculated under Option 1 better\nreflects the grantor\u2019s unearned revenue on transition date, under a short-cut method, compared to the current\ncalculation method. This is because the grantor would be able to continue to benefit from the asset after the\nservice concession arrangement has ended, and would then recognise income based on the grantor\u2019s future\nuse of the asset. The unearned revenue to be recognised under the service concession arrangement at the\ndate of transition in the form of the GORTO liability therefore relates to the remaining service concession\nperiod and should be recognised as revenue over that period.",

The\nBoard considered that compensation of revenue shortfalls in the context of AASB 1059 paragraph 16(b)\nwould not meet the definition of a financial guarantee under AASB 9 for the grantor where the grantor is\nguaranteeing payments to the operator to cover lower usage of service concession assets than expected.\nTherefore, insurance accounting would not be appropriate in measuring the liability to the operator in the\ncase of such revenue shortfalls.

The stakeholder noted that if such consideration is not adjusted in the\ngrantor\u2019s GORTO liability calculation, the GORTO liability at the date of initial application would be likely\nto be overstated, which in turn would lead to the overstatement of revenue in subsequent periods as the\nGORTO liability is unwound over the period of the service concession arrangement. The Board concluded\nthat the GORTO liability and subsequent revenue would be overstated whether the grantor had provided\nfinancial or non-financial consideration prior to the date of initial application that was not adjusted in\ndetermining the grantor\u2019s GORTO liability.  \nBC7 The Board noted that consideration transferred by the grantor to the operator in respect of a service\nconcession asset does not represent a liability or revenue for the grantor and therefore would not be\nrecognised appropriately as part of the GORTO liability on transition. Under paragraph 12 of AASB 1059,\nsuch consideration is required to be adjusted when measuring the grantor\u2019s liability at initial recognition  \n-----  based on the current replacement cost of the service concession asset. This requirement is also applicable\nfor entities applying the full retrospective transition approach to the implementation of AASB 1059.  \nBC8 The Board considered amending the GORTO liability calculation under the modified retrospective\ntransition approach has merit. The current drafting of the modified retrospective transition approach could\nresult in overstatement of the GORTO liability for affected grantors at the initial application date and of the\nsubsequent revenue recognition, which would continue throughout the remaining period of the affected\nservice concession arrangements. Considering the potential public interest in and user information needs\nregarding service concession arrangements, these overstatements could be considered qualitatively material\nand might mislead users of the financial statements for a long period of time.  \nBC9 The Board decided that changing the modified retrospective transition approach is justified under the AASB\n_Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework_ (October 2020), paragraph 30(e). This is because the\nexisting modified retrospective GORTO liability calculation \u2013 which would make no adjustment for the\ngrantor\u2019s own contributions to a service concession asset prior to the initial application date \u2013 would appear\nto result in reported financial performance or financial position not reflecting economic reality.",

        "page_content=": "## Options for addressing the issue  \nBC10 The stakeholder advised that, prior to application of AASB 1059, grantor financial contributions to service\nconcession arrangements have been capitalised as a prepayment, which is recognised as an expense over the\nconcession periods.  \nBC11 The Board considered four possible options for amending the modified retrospective GORTO liability\ncalculation in relation to grantor contributions prior to the initial application date. Options 1\u20133 differ only in\nwhat is first deducted from the fair value (current replacement cost) of the service concession asset in\ncalculating the liability.  \n-  Option 1 \u2013 measure the GORTO liability by deducting the **carrying amount of capitalised grantor**\ncontributions from the current replacement cost of the service concession asset as at the date of initial\napplication; then adjusting this amount to reflect the remaining period of the service concession\narrangement relative to the total period of the arrangement; and finally deducting the fair value of any\nrelated financial liability as at the date of initial application;  \n-  Option 2 \u2013 measure the GORTO liability by deducting the historical amounts of grantor contributions\nfrom the current replacement cost of the service concession asset as at the date of initial application;\nthen adjusting this amount to reflect the remaining period of the service concession arrangement\nrelative to the total period of the arrangement; and finally deducting the fair value of any related\nfinancial liability as at the date of initial application;  \n-  Option 3 \u2013 measure the GORTO liability by deducting the fair value of grantor contributions from the\ncurrent replacement cost of the service concession asset as at the date of initial application; then\nadjusting this amount to reflect the remaining period of the service concession arrangement relative to\nthe total period of the arrangement; and finally deducting the fair value of any related financial liability\nas at the date of initial application; and  \n-  Option 4 \u2013 measure the GORTO liability by applying the proportion of the GORTO liability relative to\nthe total liability calculated at the inception of the service concession arrangement to the current\nreplacement cost of the service concession asset as at the initial application date; and then adjusting this\namount to reflect the remaining period of the service concession arrangement relative to the total period\nof the arrangement.  \nBC12 The Board was concerned that if a contribution was made close to the inception of the arrangement and the\ncapitalised grantor contribution has a low carrying amount on the initial application date because it has been\namortised over a number of periods, Option 1 could result in a similar outcome to the current modified\nretrospective transition approach. However, this effect would be moderated since the higher the number of\nyears of amortisation to the date of initial application, the smaller the remaining period of the arrangement,\nwhich would reduce the calculated GORTO liability.  \nBC13 The Board rejected Option 2. This is because the modified retrospective transition approach requires the\nservice concession asset and any outstanding financial liability to be measured at fair value as at the initial\napplication date. Deducting the sum of historical amounts \u2013 ignoring the time value of money for the\nconsideration paid prior to the initial application date \u2013 from the fair value of the asset might not result in an\nappropriate GORTO liability amount. The time value of money would be particularly relevant for\nconsideration paid by instalments under the arrangement.  \nBC14 The Board decided against Option 3 because estimation of the fair value of historical consideration\ntransferred might not be a straightforward exercise and further guidance might be required to assist grantors  \n-----  in identifying the factors a market participant would consider when pricing such historical consideration,\nsuch as the appropriate interest rate. Such guidance would be unlikely to be finalised in time for entities\napplying AASB 1059 to the annual reporting period ending 30 June 2021, which is the initial mandatory\napplication of the Standard for most (if not all) Australian public sector grantors.  \nBC15 Under Option 4, applying the proportion of the GORTO liability relative to the total liability calculated at\nthe inception of the service concession arrangement would limit the basic GORTO liability amount at the\ndate of initial application, which is then apportioned again to reflect the remaining period of the\narrangement. However, in order to calculate the proportion of the GORTO liability relative to the total\nliability at inception, an entity would need to know the estimated value of the service concession asset that\nthe operator agreed to provide, as well as the contributions that the grantor agreed to provide to the operator.\nThe Board was concerned that it might be difficult for auditors to obtain sufficient appropriate audit\nevidence to support the estimation of the fair value of the service concession asset at inception. Option 4\nalso does not factor in any changes to the service concession asset, such as improvements or additions to the\nasset between inception and the date of initial application of AASB 1059.  \nBC16 The Board considered the advantages and disadvantages of each option and decided to adopt Option 1. This\nis because:  \n(a) the stakeholder advised that most of the affected hybrid service concession arrangements would\nstill be in the construction phase as at the date of initial application, so that the capitalised grantor\ncontributions would not yet have been amortised. Therefore, the concern described in paragraph\nBC12 would not be a significant issue in practice;  \n(b) deducting the carrying amount of the capitalised grantor contributions from the current\nreplacement cost of the service concession asset conceptually is similar to the way other existing\nassets of the grantor are treated when calculating the grantor\u2019s liability under the general\nrequirements in AASB 1059 paragraph 11 \u2013 when existing assets of the grantor are reclassified as\nservice concession assets, the grantor does not recognise a liability in relation to the reclassified\nassets; and  \n(c) it is the most straightforward option to apply out of the four options considered. Since the\ncarrying amount of the capitalised contributions typically would have been subject to audit in\nprior periods, it is expected that affected grantors would be able to provide sufficient evidence\n(based on their accounting policy) to support the carrying amount of the capitalised contributions\nas at the date of initial application.  \nBC17 The Board acknowledged that, on conceptual grounds, Option 1 might not be the most appropriate option to\napply due to the concern described in paragraph BC12. However, it noted that this is not an ongoing issue,\nas paragraph C4(c) is not expected to be applied in any period later than the annual reporting period ending\n30 June 2021, and the stakeholder advised that the concern described in paragraph BC12 does not appear to\nbe a significant issue in practice. Since there was a need to amend the current GORTO liability calculation\nin paragraph C4(c) promptly prior to the preparation of grantors\u2019 30 June 2021 financial statements, for\npractical reasons the Board decided to amend paragraph C4(c) based on Option 1.  \n-----  ",
