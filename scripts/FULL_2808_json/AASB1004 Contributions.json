However, the costs of long-service leave\nand other employee benefits are part of the cost of the goods and services provided by the government\ndepartment for which those employees work. Employment contracts or employment arrangements may be\nsuch that a government or other entity, rather than the government department, directly incurs the obligation\nto settle liabilities that arise in respect of benefits of the government department\u2019s employees.\nAlternatively, it may be that the government department initially incurs the obligation to settle such\nliabilities, and the government or other entity then assumes that obligation.  \n41 A government or other entity may initially incur, and then settle, obligations in respect of the wages,\nsalaries and other costs of the employees of a government department during the reporting period.\nSimilarly, other expenses of operating the government department during the reporting period, such as\nbuilding occupancy expenses, may be incurred and settled by the government or other entity. In such cases,\nthe government department does not recognise a liability when the expenses are initially incurred. Rather,\nthe government department recognises income equivalent to the fair value of the employee services or other\nassets it receives, and recognises expenses of the same amount to reflect that the economic benefits\nrepresented by those employee services or other benefits have been consumed by the government\ndepartment. For employee services, this normally occurs when the services are provided, but in some\ninstances the costs of these services forms part of the cost of acquiring an asset.  \n42 When an employee transfers from one government department to another government department, the\nliability in respect of employee benefits accrued up to the transfer date is usually transferred to the\ntransferee government department. In such cases, the transferor government department may make a\npayment to the transferee government department for the employee\u2019s accrued benefits. When an employee\ntransfers from one government department to another government department:  \n(a) the transferor government department extinguishes any liability for employee benefits recognised\nin respect of the employee, and recognises income equivalent to the liability extinguished. When\na payment is made or is to be made by the transferor government department in consideration for\nthe assumption of the liability by the transferee government department, the transferor  \n-----  government department extinguishes the liability and recognises a decrease in assets (cash) or an\nincrease in liabilities (cash payable). When the payment is less than the total amount of the\nliability, the transferor government department recognises income equal to the amount of that\nshortfall; and  \n(b) the transferee government department recognises an expense and a liability in respect of any\npresent obligations to pay accrued employee benefits in the future that are assumed as a\nconsequence of the transfer. When a payment is made or is to be made to the transferee\ngovernment department in consideration for the assumption of the liability, the transferee\ngovernment department recognises the liability assumed and an increase in assets (cash or cash\nreceivable). When the payment is less than the total amount of the liability for employee\nentitlements assumed, the transferee government department recognises an expense equal to the\namount of that shortfall.  \n43 As noted in paragraphs 39 to 41, a government may initially incur or subsequently assume all obligations to\nmake payments to employees of a government department in respect of long-service leave and other\nemployee benefits. In such cases, the transfer of employees between government departments will not give\nrise to the need for the transferee government department to recognise expenses and liabilities or for the\ntransferor government department to extinguish liabilities and recognise income as outlined in paragraph\n42.  \n**43A** **A government department shall disclose liabilities that were assumed during the reporting period by**\n**the government or other entity.**  \n44\u2012\n47 [Deleted]",

It may be argued that\ncontributions that are provided on the condition that they be expended on assets that increase the capacity of\nthe entity to provide particular services should be classified as contributions of equity. However, such\ncontributions would be contributions by owners, as defined in Appendix A to this Standard, only when the\ncontributor establishes by way of the contribution a financial interest in the net assets of the entity that:  \n(a) conveys entitlement both to a financial return on the contribution and to distributions of any\nexcess of assets over liabilities in the event of the entity being wound up; and/or  \n(b) can be sold, transferred or redeemed.  \n51 Contributions by owners are examples of non-reciprocal transfers. Examples of contributions by owners\n(and distributions to owners) are non-reciprocal transfers between a government department and the\ncontrolling government acting in its capacity as owner. Transactions with owners in their capacity as\nowners are not common in a local government context. A local government may on occasions receive\ncontributions by owners, as defined in Appendix A to this Standard, such as investments in the capital of\ncompanies controlled by the governing body of the local government. Such contributions would need to be\nrecognised as contributions of equity.  \n52 Contributions by owners can occur upon establishment of the entity or at a subsequent stage of the entity\u2019s\nexistence. Contributions by owners can be in the form of cash, nonmonetary assets such as property, plant\nand equipment, or the provision of services. In some instances, the contribution may result from the\nconversion of the entity\u2019s liabilities into equity.  \n53 Reductions in equity as a result of distributions to owners (either dividends or returns of capital) can be in\nthe form of a transfer of assets, a rendering of services or an increase in liabilities. Distributions from\ngovernment departments to governments are made at the discretion of the government.  \n-----  ",

The Board\nconcluded that differences should be removed, where appropriate and timely, to improve the\noverall quality of financial reporting;  \n(b) bring requirements applicable to local governments, government departments and governments\nup-to-date with contemporary accounting thought;  \n(c) consider the implications of the outcomes of its project on the harmonisation of Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS), in particular,\non the requirements in AAS 31;  \n(d) decide whether the encouragements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 should be made mandatory or\nremoved; and  \n(e) remove uncertainty in the application of cross-references to other Australian Accounting\nStandards and the override provisions in AASs 27, 29 and 31 that made the requirements in AASs\n27, 29 and 31 take precedence over other requirements.  \nBC3 The Board considered the following alternative mechanisms for implementing the approach of updating and\nimproving the requirements for local governments, government departments and governments:  \n(a) review the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 and, where appropriate:  \n(i) amend other Australian Accounting Standards to pick up any issues that are addressed\nin AASs 27, 29 and 31 that are not adequately addressed in the latest Australian\nAccounting Standards and have them apply to local governments, government\ndepartments and governments; or  \n(ii) create public sector specific topic-based Standards; and consequently withdraw\nAASs 27, 29 and 31; or  \n(b) review AASs 27, 29 and 31 and re-issue them in light of the latest Australian Accounting\nStandards, retaining/amending where necessary any issues that are addressed in AASs 27, 29 and\n31 that are not adequately addressed in the latest Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC4 The Board chose alternative (a) given the improvements in the quality of financial reporting by local\ngovernments, government departments and governments since AASs 27, 29 and 31 were first issued.  \nBC5 Where the Board identified that the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 could be improved within time and\nresource constraints, improvements have been made. Much of the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 has been\nretained substantively unamended. Improvements will be progressed in due course in line with the AASB\u2019s\nPublic Sector Policy Paper Australian Accounting Standards and Public Sector Entities.  \nBC6 The first stage of the short-term review of the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 was the preparation of a\nparagraph-by-paragraph analysis of each of AASs 27, 29 and 31, listing each paragraph of each Standard\nalongside corresponding Standards or other pronouncements that would apply to local governments,\ngovernment departments or governments in the absence of AASs 27, 29 and 31. The Board\u2019s conclusions\nand rationale for the treatment of each paragraph in the context of the review were also provided in the  \n-----  analysis. The Board\u2019s primary focus was on dealing with the requirements from the three Standards in such\na way as to not leave a vacuum.  \nBC7 Each paragraph from AASs 27, 29 and 31 was classified as being:  \n(a) no longer needed or adequately dealt with in other Standards;  \n(b) more appropriately dealt with in other Standards; or  \n(c) not adequately and/or appropriately dealt with in other Standards and therefore should be retained\nor improved and incorporated into other Standards.  \nThe paragraph-by-paragraph analyses considered by the AASB in developing the Exposure Draft ED 156\n_Proposals Arising from the Short-term Review of the Requirements in AAS 27, AAS 29 and AAS 31_ that\ngave rise to this Standard are available on the AASB website. They support, but do not form part of, this\nBasis for Conclusions.  \nBC8 In reviewing the paragraphs, the Board noted that some material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 would, under the\ncurrent style of writing Standards, be located in a separate Basis for Conclusions. Given the short-term\nnature of the review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, the Board concluded that explanations of technical issues that\nboth originated in and are being relocated from AASs 27, 29 and 31 should, when appropriate, be located in\nthe body of the Standard to which they are relocated.  \nBC9 The Board decided not to retain the illustrative general purpose financial reports provided in AASs 27, 29\nand 31, because their purpose, which was to provide an educational tool in the initial stages of accrual\nreporting by local governments, government departments and governments is no longer needed.  \nBC10 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions focuses on issues specific to contributions.",

        "page_content=": "## Contributions  \n### General approach\nBC11 The Board decided to broadly retain the material on contributions from AASs 27, 29 and 31 and locate it in\nseparate sections within AASB 1004 because it was not adequately covered in existing Australian\nAccounting Standards.  \nBC12 The Board concluded that, in the short term, minimal changes should be made to the content of the material.\nThe Board considered that it is appropriate to review the requirements and guidance for contributions as\npart of a longer-term project as outlined in the AASB\u2019s Public Sector Policy Paper. A review by the Board\nof non-exchange income, which will incorporate a review of contributions, is in progress at the time of\nrevision of this Standard.  \nBC13 The Board considered two options for relocating the requirements on contributions into AASB 1004:  \n(a) merging the AASs 27, 29 and 31 paragraphs into the then existing AASB 1004 requirements; or  \n(b) adding the AASs 27, 29 and 31 paragraphs into the existing AASB 1004 as separate sections.  \nThe paragraphs in AASs 27, 29 and 31 containing guidance about contributions were very detailed and\ncontained a large amount of commentary whereas the then existing guidance in AASB 1004 was\nsignificantly less detailed. The Board concluded that merging the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 with\nthe AASB 1004 requirements would, in effect, require the redrafting of the entire Standard, which is beyond\nthe scope of this project. The integration approach was also considered more likely to raise controversial\nrevenue recognition issues for all not-for-profit entities that, as noted in paragraph BC12, the Board will\ndeal with as a separate longer-term project applicable to a broader range of entities.  \nBC14 The Board also considered whether the guidance from AASs 27, 29 and 31 should be merged into a single\nset of generic requirements or expressed separately for local governments, government departments or\ngovernments. The Board concluded that the three sets of guidance from AASs 27, 29 and 31 were\nsufficiently similar to be merged to form one set of requirements \u2013 noting that such an approach results in\nsome changes for some entities. One area where this occurs is the disclosure of contributions, where\ngovernment departments and governments are now required to make disclosures not previously required,\nbecause AAS 27 was more onerous than AASs 29 and 31.  \nBC15 The Board decided to include specific references to the application of this Standard to General Government\nSectors (GGSs) to support/clarify the AASB 1049 Financial Reporting of General Government Sectors by\n_Governments requirement for GGSs to adopt other Australian Accounting Standards, including this_\nStandard. As this Standard has many parts, applicable to different groups of entities, the Board considered\nit would aid users to explicitly refer to GGSs in paragraph 1(d) and throughout this Standard.  \n-----  BC16 In addition, the Board decided to extend the application of the requirements relating to \u2018contributions of\nservices\u2019 to apply beyond government departments to local governments, GGSs and whole of governments,\nfor consistency across these types of entities.  \nBC17 Because the guidance from AASs 27, 29 and 31 partly overlapped with the guidance in the superseded\nAASB 1004, the Board amended the requirements to reduce duplication.  \nBC18 The Board considered whether the paragraphs of AAS 29 that address the accounting for parliamentary\nappropriations, which are only applicable to government departments, should be incorporated into this\nStandard as a separate section. The Board noted the view that the requirements are no longer needed given\nthe nature of current arrangements between governments and government departments for parliamentary\nappropriations compared with past arrangements and government departments\u2019 familiarity with accrual\naccounting. However, the Board concluded that the paragraphs should be retained, in keeping with Board\u2019s\nshort-term intention of retaining the guidance from AASs 27, 29 and 31 where there are no comparable\nrequirements in existing Australian Accounting Standards and thereby avoid creating a vacuum.  \nBC19 Paragraph 15.2.1 of AAS 31 dealt with the disclosure of policies adopted for recognising tax revenues.\nGiven the nature of the commentary, the Board concluded that it would be most logical to locate the\ncontents of this paragraph in paragraph 30 of this Standard within the area that relates to recognition of\n\u2018contributions, other than contributions by owners, by local governments, government departments, GGSs\nor whole of governments\u2019 and within the section \u2018control over assets\u2019 in a paragraph that discusses control\nover assets acquired from involuntary non-reciprocal transfers, such as rates, taxes and fines. In doing this,\nthe Board decided to extend the requirements beyond whole of governments to local governments,\ngovernment departments and GGSs.",

The Board concluded\nthat, although the superseded AASB 1004 specified requirements for liabilities that are forgiven, it did not\nexplicitly deal with liabilities that are assumed by other entities.  \nBC21 The Board considered whether to align the requirements in paragraphs 8.2, 8.2.1 and 8.2.3-8.2.5 of AAS 29\nfor derecognition of liabilities with the corresponding requirements in AASB 139 _Financial Instruments:_\n_Recognition and Measurement. The Board noted that the AAS 29 requirements, which reflected a_\nsymmetrical accounting approach, may not be consistent with the criteria for derecognition of a liability in\nAASB 139, which does not necessarily result in symmetry and refers to liabilities arising from contracts.\nGiven the relationship between an entity assuming a government department\u2019s liability (such as the\ncontrolling government) and the government department, the Board concluded that the symmetrical\naccounting adopted in AAS 29 is appropriate for derecognition of liabilities.",

This is because they are disclosures of items of revenue that, for the\npurpose of the short-term review, are considered to be sufficiently related to the scope of the superseded\nAASB 1004.  \nBC23 The Board decided to limit the requirements in paragraphs 12.2(b) and (c) of AAS 29 to government\ndepartments, in keeping with its approach of retaining AASs 27, 29 and 31 requirements in the short term.\nIn keeping with the Board\u2019s decision to extend the application of the section on \u2018contribution of services\u2019 to\napply beyond government departments to local governments, GGSs and whole of governments (see\nparagraph BC16), the Board concluded that the disclosure requirements in paragraph 12.2(d) of AAS 29\nrelating to revenue disclosures about contributions of services should also be extended to apply to local\ngovernments, GGSs and whole of governments.

        "page_content=": "## Restructures of administrative arrangements  \nBC24 The Board considered it timely to amend the requirements in paragraphs 7.4, 7.4.2 and 10.6-10.9.3 of\nAAS 29 for restructures of administrative arrangements as part of the short-term review of AAS 29 and in\nlight of the existing definition of contributions by owners that is contained in this Standard. The Board\ndecided to define restructures of administrative arrangements and to specify that they are in the nature of\ntransactions with owners in their capacity as owners to be recognised on a net basis. In particular, the\nBoard concluded that a transfer of net assets arising as a consequence of a restructure of administrative\narrangements is faithfully represented as a distribution to owners by the transferor and a contribution by\nowners by the transferee. The Board also noted that this would result in greater consistency in accounting\nfor restructures of administrative arrangements. The Board concluded that this approach is preferable to the\nsuperseded approach whereby transfers need to be designated as contributions by owners at the time of the\ntransfer to be treated as such. The Board noted that this would result in a significant change in the current\nAAS 29 requirements as the possibility of treating a transfer as a revenue/expense item would no longer be\navailable, and would give rise to amendments to Interpretation 1038 _Contributions by Owners Made to_\n_Wholly-Owned Public Sector Entities to make it consistent with this Standard. Consistent with the short-_\nterm nature of the review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, the Board intends making amendments to Interpretation\n1038 to make it consistent with this Standard. In the longer term, the Board intends to undertake a\nfundamental review of Interpretation 1038.  \nBC25 The Board concluded that the effect of the requirements should be expanded beyond government\ndepartments to include all government controlled not-for-profit public sector entities and for-profit\ngovernment departments, noting that this would increase the consistency with the scope of\nInterpretation 1038 which applies to all wholly-owned public sector entities that prepare general purpose\nfinancial statements, not just government departments. This will assist in harmonising requirements and\nguidance in relation to contributions by owners. It is not intended that the amended requirements for\nrestructures of administrative arrangements necessarily apply in analogous circumstances. For example, it\nis not intended that the amended requirements apply in the accounting for restructures of commonlycontrolled private sector entities.  \nBC26 Although assets and/or liabilities assumed by another entity as a consequence of a restructure of\nadministrative arrangements were not explicitly dealt with in the superseded AASB 1004, the Board\nconcluded that this Standard is an appropriate location for this material as it is the Standard that is best\nsuited to dealing with contributions, including contributions by owners, to not-for-profit reporting entities\nand for-profit government departments.  \nBC27 In addition, in accordance with its decision to issue AASB 2005-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting\n_Standards [AASB 3], the Board concluded that AASB 3_ _Business Combinations is not an appropriate_\nStandard in which to locate specific requirements relating to restructures of administrative arrangements\nbecause business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control are now excluded\nfrom the scope of AASB 3. However, a cross-reference from AASB 3 to AASB 1004 is provided to assist\nin understanding the relationship between the two Standards.  \nBC28 The Board also concluded that it is not necessary at this time to explicitly address the measurement basis to\nbe adopted for transferred assets and liabilities due to a restructure of administrative arrangements. An\nasset acquired by a government controlled not-for-profit entity or a for-profit government department as a\nconsequence of a restructure of administrative arrangements is considered to be a contribution by owners.\nNot specifying the measurement basis is consistent with Interpretation 1038, which also does not specify the\nmeasurement basis to be adopted with respect to contributions by owners or distributions to owners. In\naddition, AASB 3 does not address the measurement issue for a restructure of entities under common\ncontrol. The Board also noted that measurement requirements in AASB 116 _Property, Plant and_\n_Equipment_ (including paragraph Aus15.1) do not apply to assets transferred under a restructure of\nadministrative arrangements because they are acquired by the transferee as part of a business. The Board\nacknowledges that, as the proposed amendments do not specify the measurement basis to be adopted, assets\nand liabilities transferred in the course of a restructure of administrative arrangements could be measured at\nfair value or book value.  \nBC29 The Board noted that the scope of the requirements relating to restructures of administrative arrangements is\nlimited to the transfer of a business (as defined in AASB 3). The Board does not intend the requirements to\napply where, for example, an individual asset or a group of assets that are not a business are transferred,\nnoting that transfers of an individual asset and a group of assets are scoped out by the definition of a\nbusiness in AASB 3.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "### The need for change\nBC2 Prior to the issue of this Standard and AASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the recognition_\nand measurement requirements for transactions giving rise to income depended on whether the transaction\nwas reciprocal or non-reciprocal in nature. The accounting for income arising from reciprocal transactions\nwas predominantly addressed in AASB 118 _Revenue and AASB 111_ _Construction Contracts. The_\naccounting for income arising from non-reciprocal transactions was addressed in AASB 1004\n_Contributions._  \nBC3 The Board observed determining whether a transaction was reciprocal or non-reciprocal in practice was not\nalways straightforward. Entities found it challenging to determine whether approximately equal value had\nbeen provided in exchange to the other party or parties to the transfer, and contended that in many instances\nthe immediate recognition of income in a non-reciprocal transaction did not faithfully represent the\nunderlying financial performance of the entity. Diverse interpretations existed, with some entities\nrecognising transactions with return obligations and specified performance outcomes as reciprocal\ntransactions and some not.  \nBC4 Constituents were particularly concerned about the income recognition requirements as applied to grants,\nappropriations and other transfers of assets made on the condition that the not-for-profit entity deliver goods\nor services to nominated third parties. The Board heard that constituents who are preparers find it difficult\nto discuss financial information with grantors and donors, and challenging to explain why a not-for-profit\nentity needed additional resources when the financial statements indicated no such need. Users noted they\ndid not think the financial statements were reflective of the economic reality of a not-for-profit entity\u2019s\nfinancial circumstances.  Having regard to the feedback from constituents, the Board decided to undertake\na project to conduct a fundamental review of the income recognition requirements applying to not-for-profit\nentities.  \nBC5 The Board observed that the International Accounting Standards Board had completed developments in the\naccounting for revenue with the issue of IFRS 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014._\nThe Board noted it still needed to determine what, if any, amendments and guidance would be required to\nenable not-for-profit entities to apply the equivalent Australian Accounting Standard, AASB 15. In\naddition, the Board noted that the application of the performance obligation approach to revenue\nrecognition adopted in AASB 15, using a broader concept of customer, had the potential to resolve some of\nthe issues noted with AASB 1004. Consequently, the Board considered that this was an appropriate time to\nundertake a project to review the income recognition requirements applying to not-for-profit entities.  \nBC6 As part of its current project, the Board noted there is currently divergence in practice in the accounting for\nleases with significantly below-market terms and conditions, such as \u2018peppercorn\u2019 leases where a nominal\namount is made as payment to the lessor. Some entities consider AASB 117 Leases takes precedence over\nAASB 1004 and accordingly, currently recognise such leases at nominal values; others consider the reverse\napplies and recognise such leases at fair value, together with a related contribution. The Board decided its\nproject should also clarify the accounting for such leases.  \nBC7 The Board also observed that various Australian Accounting Standards required a not-for-profit entity to\nrecognise assets received at fair value (or current replacement cost, in relation to inventories) only where\nthe asset had been acquired for no or nominal consideration (for example, AASB 116 _Property, Plant and_\n_Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets). The Board perceived there to be a gap in the accounting for_\nthose transactions where an asset has been acquired for consideration that is below market but is more than\nnominal. The Board noted that under existing recognition and measurement rules at that time, an entity\nwould likely not have recognised any income on the transaction, but measured the asset acquired at the\namount of the consideration transferred. The Board considered that, in many instances, such transactions  \n-----  were unlikely to be conceptually different to those for which no consideration was transferred, and\nconsequently decided to also consider the accounting for such transactions as part of this project.",

The Board decided to carry forward\nthese aspects into AASB 1058 as it was concerned that a wide-ranging review of the recognition\nrequirements for volunteer services could take significant time and potentially delay the completion of this\nproject.  \nBC108 AASB 1004 does not specifically indicate the circumstances in which not-for-profit entities other than those\nspecifically identified can recognise volunteer services. Consequently, not-for-profit entities may elect to\nrecognise volunteer services based on an accounting policy developed in accordance with AASB 108.\nED 260 proposed clarifying that not-for-profit entities may elect to recognise volunteer services if the fair  \n-----  value of those services can be measured reliably, without necessarily needing to have been purchased had\nthe services not been donated. In forming the proposal, the Board observed the purchase pre-requisite in\nAASB 1004 was primarily focused on limiting the scope of volunteer services for which recognition by\nparticular public sector not-for-profit entities is required. The Board considered not-for-profit entities\nshould be able to elect to recognise volunteer services with a fair value that can be measured reliably even if\nthose services would not have been purchased if they had not been donated.  \nBC109 The Board noted that carrying forward the treatment of volunteer services from AASB 1004 almost\nunchanged retains an inconsistency between private sector and public sector not-for-profit entities regarding\nthe scope of the recognition requirements for volunteer services. The Board acknowledged the\ninconsistency reflects the transfer of recognition requirements for volunteer services to AASB 1004 upon\nthe withdrawal of Australian Accounting Standards for specific types of public sector entity (namely, AAS\n27 Financial Reporting by Local Governments, AAS 29 Financial Reporting by Government Departments\nand AAS 31 Financial Reporting by Governments) in 2007, rather than a difference in information needs of\nusers of financial statements of not-for-profit entities in the private and public sectors.  \nBC110 Many respondents to ED 260 were of the view that the requirements with respect to the recognition of\nvolunteer services should be the same for all not-for-profit entities. However, many opined that the\nrecognition of volunteer services should be optional, primarily for cost\u2013benefit reasons. Some encouraged\nthe Board to expedite consideration of whether there was differentiation between entities in the sector to\njustify different accounting requirements. Others suggested that the treatment and location of information\nabout volunteer services be reconsidered by the Board.  \nBC111 The Board considered how to progress its consideration of the accounting for volunteer services, having\nregard to the feedback received. The Board noted further consideration and due process would be required\nbefore it could finalise any broad changes to the current accounting requirements in this regard.\nAccordingly, the Board decided, as a short-term solution, to finalise the recognition and measurement\nproposals largely unamended from those exposed. (See also paragraphs BC123\u2013BC124 below.)  \nBC112 The Board expects to consider the accounting requirements for volunteer services as part of a separate\nfuture project.  \n\u2026",

The Board noted that in due\ncourse, it would consider extending the application of the requirements.  \nBC132 As part of this project, the Board reviewed the specified disclosures of compliance with parliamentary\nappropriations and other externally-imposed requirements required of government departments which had\nbeen included in AASB 1004 (now deleted from that Standard). The Board decided, in light of changes in\npublic sector financial management arrangements since originally developing these requirements, to\npropose extending the scope of disclosures in this regard to include other public sector entities that obtain\npart or all of their spending authority from parliamentary appropriations.  \nBC133 In reviewing the disclosures, the Board acknowledged constituent concerns that the interaction between two\nof the specified disclosures was unclear, as the scope of paragraph 64(e) of AASB 1004 was broader than\nthe scope of paragraph 64(d). The Board decided to clarify its requirements in this regard by proposing in\nED 260:  \n(a) not to carry forward the text of paragraph 64(e) into AASB 1058; and  \n(b) to require disclosure of the financial consequences of an unauthorised expenditure.  \nBC134 Respondents to the ED were generally supportive of the Board\u2019s proposals in this regard. In its\nredeliberations, the Board noted a concern raised that by extending the application of these disclosure\nrequirements beyond government departments some might interpret the disclosure requirements as applying\nto for-profit entities in the public sector. The Board observed that the scope of AASB 1058 is limited to\nnot-for-profit entities and therefore for-profit public sector entities would not be subject to these disclosures.  \n-----  BC135 The Board discussed a concern whether the proposed disclosure requirements duplicate existing disclosures\nin AASB 1055 _Budgetary Reporting. The Board reaffirmed its view that these disclosures contain_\nfundamentally different requirements from AASB 1055 and should be retained, as the disclosures are\nfocused on information concerning how appropriations and other advances received have been expended,\nrather than the more broadly based requirements in AASB 1055 for actual to budget variance analysis (see\nparagraph BC28 in AASB 1055).  \nBC136 In addition, as part of its deliberations, the Board discussed whether to relocate disclosures about a\ngovernment department\u2019s compliance with parliamentary appropriations and other externally-imposed\nrequirements from AASB 1004 to AASB 1054 Australian Additional Disclosures, rather than this Standard.\nThe Board concluded it would be more user-friendly to include these disclosure requirements in AASB\n1058 given the nexus between the income of government departments and appropriated amounts.  \nBC137 Having regard to the feedback received, the Board decided to finalise the disclosure in this regard largely as\nexposed in ED 260.  \n\u2026",

The Board observed:  \n(a) the IASB has not defined a similar term employed within the definition of \u2018income\u2019 in IFRS\nStandards; and  \n(b) the IPSASB\u2019s Public Sector Conceptual Framework includes a broader definition of \u2018ownership\ncontributions\u2019 than that in Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC169 Acknowledging constituent concerns about application of the term, the Board decided to invite comment on\nthe defined term \u201ccontributions by owners\u201d as part of this project. The Board did not make a specific\nproposal regarding the definition of \u201ccontributions by owners\u201d. Instead, ED 260 illustrated what a\nreplacement Standard for AASB 1004 would look like without that definition and particular related\nguidance, and posed related questions including whether a definition of \u2018contributions by owners\u2019 is still\nnecessary, or appropriate.  \nBC170 In responding to the ED, constituents noted the definition in AASB 1004 can be problematic, identified a\nneed for a definition of contributions by owners and expressed their support for applying the IPSASB\ndefinition or using the IPSASB definition as the basis for an Australian definition. Many respondents\nconsidered a definition was necessary to minimise diversity in practice.  \nBC171 In addition, the majority of respondents to ED 260 responding on this topic supported the withdrawal of\nInterpretation 1038.  \nBC172 Having regard to the feedback received, the Board considered whether to:  \n(a) withdraw and not replace the current definition in AASB 1004 and Interpretation 1038;  \n(b) replace the current definition in AASB 1004 with the definition of ownership contributions\nadopted by the IPSASB, and separately consider whether to retain an amended Interpretation\n1038; or  \n(c) address the accounting for contributions by owners as part of a separate project.  \nBC173 The Board was conscious of the need to finalise its proposals on other aspects of its current project in a\ntimely manner.

Accordingly, the Board decided to\nprogress consideration of \u2018contributions by owners\u2019 and the related requirements as part of a separate\nproject. Consequently, the Board decided to retain, for the interim:  \n(a) the terms \u2018contributions\u2019 and \u2018contributions by owners\u2019 as presently defined in Australian\nAccounting Standards;  \n-----  (b) the requirements specified in AASB 1004 and AASB Interpretation 1038 _Contributions by_\n_Owners Made to Wholly-Owned Public Sector Entities with respect to contributions by owners_\nand distributions to owners; and  \n(c) the requirements specified in AASB 1004 with respect to contributions by owners and\ndistributions to owners, including those arising in relation to restructures of administrative\narrangements.  \n-----  ",
