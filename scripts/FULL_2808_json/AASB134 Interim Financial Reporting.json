        "page_content=": "## Scope  \n1 This Standard does not mandate which entities should be required to publish interim financial reports, how\nfrequently, or how soon after the end of an interim period. However, governments, securities regulators,\nstock exchanges, and accountancy bodies often require entities whose debt or equity securities are publicly\ntraded to publish interim financial reports. This Standard applies if an entity is required or elects to publish\nan interim financial report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. The International\nAccounting Standards Committee[1] encourages publicly traded entities to provide interim financial reports\nthat conform to the recognition, measurement, and disclosure principles set out in this Standard.\nSpecifically, publicly traded entities are encouraged:  \n(a) to provide interim financial reports at least as of the end of the first half of their financial year;\nand  \n(b) to make their interim financial reports available not later than 60 days after the end of the interim\nperiod.  \nAusCF1 AusCF paragraphs and footnotes included in this Standard apply only to:  \n(a) not-for-profit entities; and  \n(b) for-profit entities that are not applying the _Conceptual Framework for Financial_\n_Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards)._  \nSuch entities are referred to as \u2018AusCF entities\u2019. For AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is\ndefined in AASB 1057 _Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of_\nAccounting Concepts SAC 1 _Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities_\napplying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of\nthe Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF paragraphs or footnotes.  \nAus1.1 Under the Corporations Act, disclosing entities are required to prepare half-year financial reports.\nDisclosing entities may also voluntarily prepare other general purpose interim financial reports.\nThis Standard prescribes the form and content of general purpose interim financial reports,\nincluding half-year financial reports prepared by disclosing entities.  \nAus1.2 Interim financial reports that are intended to be special purpose financial reports do not fall within\nthe scope of this Standard. However, interim financial reports that are purported to be special\npurpose financial reports but have the characteristics of general purpose financial statements fall  \n1 The International Accounting Standards Committee was succeeded by the International Accounting Standards Board, which began\noperations in 2001.  \n-----  within the scope of this Standard. Interim financial reports that are widely available but lack the\ncharacteristics of general purpose financial statements are not regarded as general purpose\nfinancial statements. An example is selected interim summary financial information, such as\nturnover and profit, voluntarily released by some entities. In some cases, professional judgement\nis needed to determine whether particular interim financial reports are general purpose financial\nstatements.  \n2 Each financial report, annual or interim, is evaluated on its own for conformity to Australian Accounting\nStandards. The fact that an entity may not have provided interim financial reports during a particular\nfinancial year or may have provided interim financial reports that do not comply with this Standard does not\nprevent the entity\u2019s annual financial statements from conforming to Australian Accounting Standards if they\notherwise do so.  \n**Aus2.1** **This Standard does not apply to interim financial reports for the General Government**",

This Standard defines the minimum content of an interim financial\nreport as including condensed financial statements and selected explanatory notes. The interim financial\nreport is intended to provide an update on the latest complete set of annual financial statements.\nAccordingly, it focuses on new activities, events, and circumstances and does not duplicate information\npreviously reported.  \n7 Nothing in this Standard is intended to prohibit or discourage an entity from publishing a complete set of\nfinancial statements (as described in AASB 101) in its interim financial report, rather than condensed\nfinancial statements and selected explanatory notes. Nor does this Standard prohibit or discourage an entity\nfrom including in condensed interim financial statements more than the minimum line items or selected\nexplanatory notes as set out in this Standard.

To achieve that objective, measurements for interim reporting**\n**purposes shall be made on a year-to-date basis.**  \n29 Requiring that an entity apply the same accounting policies in its interim financial statements as in its\nannual statements may seem to suggest that interim period measurements are made as if each interim period\nstands alone as an independent reporting period. However, by providing that the frequency of an entity\u2019s\nreporting shall not affect the measurement of its annual results, paragraph 28 acknowledges that an interim\nperiod is a part of a larger financial year. Year-to-date measurements may involve changes in estimates of\namounts reported in prior interim periods of the current financial year. But the principles for recognising\nassets, liabilities, income, and expenses for interim periods are the same as in annual financial statements.  \n30 To illustrate:  \n(a) the principles for recognising and measuring losses from inventory write-downs, restructurings,\nor impairments in an interim period are the same as those that an entity would follow if it\nprepared only annual financial statements. However, if such items are recognised and measured\nin one interim period and the estimate changes in a subsequent interim period of that financial\nyear, the original estimate is changed in the subsequent interim period either by accrual of an\nadditional amount of loss or by reversal of the previously recognised amount;  \n(b) a cost that does not meet the definition of an asset at the end of an interim period is not deferred\nin the statement of financial position either to await future information as to whether it has met\nthe definition of an asset or to smooth earnings over interim periods within a financial year; and  \n(c) income tax expense is recognised in each interim period based on the best estimate of the\nweighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. Amounts accrued\nfor income tax expense in one interim period may have to be adjusted in a subsequent interim\nperiod of that financial year if the estimate of the annual income tax rate changes.  \n31 Under the _Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting_ (Conceptual Framework) (as identified in\nAASB 1048 _Interpretation of Standards), recognition is the process of capturing, for inclusion in the_\nstatement of financial position or the statement(s) of financial performance, an item that meets the definition\nof one of the elements of the financial statements. The definitions of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses\nare fundamental to recognition, at the end of both annual and interim financial reporting periods.  \nAusCF31 Notwithstanding paragraph 31, in respect of AusCF entities, under the _Framework for the_\n_Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements_ (the _Framework) (as identified in_\nAASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards)[AusCF3], recognition is the \u2018process of incorporating in the\nbalance sheet or income statement an item that meets the definition of an element and satisfies the\ncriteria for recognition\u2019. The definitions of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are\nfundamental to recognition, at the end of both annual and interim financial reporting periods.  \n32 For assets, the same tests of future economic benefits apply at interim dates and at the end of an entity\u2019s\nfinancial year. Costs that, by their nature, would not qualify as assets at financial year-end would not qualify\nat interim dates either. Similarly, a liability at the end of an interim reporting period must represent an\nexisting obligation at that date, just as it must at the end of an annual reporting period.  \n33 An essential characteristic of income (revenue) and expenses is that the related inflows and outflows of\nassets and liabilities have already taken place. If those inflows or outflows have taken place, the related\nrevenue and expense are recognised; otherwise they are not recognised. The Conceptual Framework does\nnot allow the recognition of items in the statement of financial position which do not meet the definition of\nassets or liabilities.  \nAusCF33 Notwithstanding paragraph 33, in respect of AusCF entities, an essential characteristic of income\n(revenue) and expenses is that the related inflows and outflows of assets and liabilities have\nalready taken place. If those inflows or outflows have taken place, the related revenue and\nexpense are recognised; otherwise they are not recognised. The Framework says that \u2018expenses\nare recognised in the income statement when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a\ndecrease in an asset or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably \u2026 [The]\n_Framework does not allow the recognition of items in the balance sheet which do not meet the_\ndefinition of assets or liabilities.\u2019  \n34 In measuring the assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows reported in its financial statements, an\nentity that reports only annually is able to take into account information that becomes available throughout\nthe financial year. Its measurements are, in effect, on a year-to-date basis.  \nAusCF3 In December 2013 the AASB amended the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.  \n-----  35 An entity that reports half-yearly uses information available by mid-year or shortly thereafter in making the\nmeasurements in its financial statements for the first six-month period and information available by yearend or shortly thereafter for the twelve-month period. The twelve-month measurements will reflect possible\nchanges in estimates of amounts reported for the first six-month period. The amounts reported in the interim\nfinancial report for the first six-month period are not retrospectively adjusted. Paragraphs 16A(d) and 26\nrequire, however, that the nature and amount of any significant changes in estimates be disclosed.  \n36 An entity that reports more frequently than half-yearly measures income and expenses on a year-to-date\nbasis for each interim period using information available when each set of financial statements is being\nprepared. Amounts of income and expenses reported in the current interim period will reflect any changes\nin estimates of amounts reported in prior interim periods of the financial year. The amounts reported in prior\ninterim periods are not retrospectively adjusted. Paragraphs 16A(d) and 26 require, however, that the nature\nand amount of any significant changes in estimates be disclosed.",

Income taxes are assessed on an annual basis. Interim period income tax expense is calculated\nby applying to an interim period\u2019s pre-tax income the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total\nannual earnings, that is, the estimated average annual effective income tax rate. That estimated average\nannual rate would reflect a blend of the progressive tax rate structure expected to be applicable to the full\nyear\u2019s earnings including enacted or substantively enacted changes in the income tax rates scheduled to take\neffect later in the financial year. AASB 112 _Income Taxes provides guidance on substantively enacted_\nchanges in tax rates. The estimated average annual income tax rate would be re-estimated on a year-to-date\nbasis, consistent with paragraph 28 of the Standard. Paragraph 16A requires disclosure of a significant\nchange in estimate.  \nB14 To the extent practicable, a separate estimated average annual effective income tax rate is determined for\neach taxing jurisdiction and applied individually to the interim period pre-tax income of each jurisdiction.\nSimilarly, if different income tax rates apply to different categories of income (such as capital gains or\nincome earned in particular industries), to the extent practicable a separate rate is applied to each individual\ncategory of interim period pre-tax income. While that degree of precision is desirable, it may not be\nachievable in all cases, and a weighted average of rates across jurisdictions or across categories of income is\nused if it is a reasonable approximation of the effect of using more specific rates.  \nB15 To illustrate the application of the foregoing principle, an entity reporting quarterly expects to earn 10,000\npre-tax each quarter and operates in a jurisdiction with a tax rate of 20 per cent on the first 20,000 of annual\nearnings and 30 per cent on all additional earnings.

It may be sufficient to make estimates at interim dates\nbased on sales margins.  \nC2 **Classifications of current and non-current assets and liabilities: Entities may do a more thorough**\ninvestigation for classifying assets and liabilities as current or non-current at annual reporting dates than at\ninterim dates.  \nC3 **Provisions: Determination of the appropriate amount of a provision (such as a provision for warranties,**\nenvironmental costs, and site restoration costs) may be complex and often costly and time-consuming.\nEntities sometimes engage outside experts to assist in the annual calculations. Making similar estimates at\ninterim dates often entails updating of the prior annual provision rather than the engaging of outside experts\nto do a new calculation.  \nC4 **Pensions: AASB 119 Employee Benefits requires an entity to determine the present value of defined benefit**\nobligations and the fair value of plan assets at the end of each reporting period and encourages an entity to  \n-----  involve a professionally qualified actuary in measurement of the obligations. For interim reporting\npurposes, reliable measurement is often obtainable by extrapolation of the latest actuarial valuation.  \nC5 **Income taxes: Entities may calculate income tax expense and deferred income tax liability at annual dates**\nby applying the tax rate for each individual jurisdiction to measures of income for each jurisdiction.\nParagraph B14 acknowledges that while that degree of precision is desirable at interim reporting dates as\nwell, it may not be achievable in all cases, and a weighted average of rates across jurisdictions or across\ncategories of income is used if it is a reasonable approximation of the effect of using more specific rates.  \nC6 **Contingencies: The measurement of contingencies may involve the opinions of legal experts or other**\nadvisers. Formal reports from independent experts are sometimes obtained with respect to contingencies.\nSuch opinions about litigation, claims, assessments, and other contingencies and uncertainties may or may\nnot also be needed at interim dates.  \nC7 **Revaluations and fair value accounting: AASB 116** _Property, Plant and Equipment allows an entity to_\nchoose as its accounting policy the revaluation model whereby items of property, plant and equipment are\nrevalued to fair value. AASB 16 _Leases allows a lessee to measure right-of-use assets applying the_\nrevaluation model in AASB 116 if those right-of-use assets relate to a class of property, plant and\nequipment to which the lessee applies the revaluation model in AASB 116. Similarly, AASB 140\n_Investment Property requires an entity to measure the fair value of investment property. For those_\nmeasurements, an entity may rely on professionally qualified valuers at annual reporting dates though not at\ninterim reporting dates.  \nC8 **Intercompany reconciliations: Some intercompany balances that are reconciled on a detailed level in**\npreparing consolidated financial statements at financial year-end might be reconciled at a less detailed level\nin preparing consolidated financial statements at an interim date.  \nC9 **Specialised industries: Because of complexity, costliness, and time, interim period measurements in**\nspecialised industries might be less precise than at financial year-end. An example would be calculation of\ninsurance reserves by insurance companies.  \n-----  ",
