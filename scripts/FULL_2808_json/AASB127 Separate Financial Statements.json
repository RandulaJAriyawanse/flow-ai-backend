Earlier\napplication is permitted for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 but before 1 January 2016. If an\nentity applies this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply AASB 10, AASB 11, AASB 12 and\nAASB 128 at the same time.  \n18A AASB 2013-5 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Investment Entities, issued in August_\n2013, amended the previous version of this Standard as follows: amended paragraphs 5, 6, 17 and 18, and\nadded paragraphs 8A, 11A\u201311B, 16A and 18B\u201318I. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Early adoption is permitted. If an entity applies those\namendments earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply all amendments included in _Investment Entities at_\nthe same time.  \n18B If, at the date of initial application of AASB 2013-5 (which, for the purposes of this Standard, is the\nbeginning of the annual reporting period for which those amendments are applied for the first time), a\nparent concludes that it is an investment entity, it shall apply paragraphs 18C\u201318I to its investment in a\nsubsidiary.  \n18C At the date of initial application, an investment entity that previously measured its investment in a\nsubsidiary at cost shall instead measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss as if the\nrequirements of this Standard had always been effective. The investment entity shall adjust retrospectively\nthe annual period immediately preceding the date of initial application and shall adjust retained earnings at\nthe beginning of the immediately preceding period for any difference between:  \n(a) the previous carrying amount of the investment; and  \n(b) the fair value of the investor\u2019s investment in the subsidiary.  \n18D At the date of initial application, an investment entity that previously measured its investment in a\nsubsidiary at fair value through other comprehensive income shall continue to measure that investment at\nfair value. The cumulative amount of any fair value adjustment previously recognised in other\ncomprehensive income shall be transferred to retained earnings at the beginning of the annual period\nimmediately preceding the date of initial application.  \n18E At the date of initial application, an investment entity shall not make adjustments to the previous accounting\nfor an interest in a subsidiary that it had previously elected to measure at fair value through profit or loss in\naccordance with AASB 9, as permitted in paragraph 10.  \n18F Before the date that AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement is adopted, an investment entity shall use the fair\nvalue amounts previously reported to investors or to management, if those amounts represent the amount for\nwhich the investment could have been exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm\u2019s\nlength transaction at the date of the valuation.  \n18G If measuring the investment in the subsidiary in accordance with paragraphs 18C\u201318F is impracticable (as\ndefined in AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors), an investment_\nentity shall apply the requirements of this Standard at the beginning of the earliest period for which\napplication of paragraphs 18C\u201318F is practicable, which may be the current period. The investor shall\nadjust retrospectively the annual period immediately preceding the date of initial application, unless the\nbeginning of the earliest period for which application of this paragraph is practicable is the current period.\nWhen the date that it is practicable for the investment entity to measure the fair value of the subsidiary is\nearlier than the beginning of the immediately preceding period, the investor shall adjust equity at the\nbeginning of the immediately preceding period for any difference between:  \n(a) the previous carrying amount of the investment; and  \n(b) the fair value of the investor\u2019s investment in the subsidiary.  \n-----  If the earliest period for which application of this paragraph is practicable is the current period, the\nadjustment to equity shall be recognised at the beginning of the current period.  \n18H If an investment entity has disposed of, or lost control of, an investment in a subsidiary before the date of\ninitial application of AASB 2013-5, the investment entity is not required to make adjustments to the\nprevious accounting for that investment.  \n18I Notwithstanding the references to the annual period immediately preceding the date of initial application\n(the \u2018immediately preceding period\u2019) in paragraphs 18C\u201318G, an entity may also present adjusted\ncomparative information for any earlier periods presented, but is not required to do so. If an entity does\npresent adjusted comparative information for any earlier periods, all references to the \u2018immediately\npreceding period\u2019 in paragraphs 18C\u201318G shall be read as the \u2018earliest adjusted comparative period\npresented\u2019.
