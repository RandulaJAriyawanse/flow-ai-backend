IFRS 18 aims to improve how entities communicate in their financial statements, with a focus on information_\nabout financial performance in the statement of profit or loss. Better information will contribute to efficient and resilient\ncapital markets by enabling financial statement users to make better decisions.  \nThe Standard responds to stakeholder feedback that:  \n(a) statements of profit or loss varied in structure and content;  \n(b) measures defined by management are useful to investors, but entities might not explain how these measures\nare calculated and why they are used; and  \n(c) investors would like to see information more appropriately grouped (aggregated or disaggregated) in the\nfinancial statements.  \nAASB 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements is the Australian equivalent of IFRS 18.",

        "page_content=": "### Main requirements  \nThe key presentation and disclosure requirements established by AASB 18 are:  \n(a) the presentation of newly defined subtotals in the statement of profit or loss. AASB 18 requires an entity to:  \n(i) classify income and expenses into operating, investing and financing categories in the statement of\nprofit or loss \u2013 plus income taxes and discontinued operations; and  \n(ii) present two newly defined subtotals \u2013 operating profit and profit before financing and income taxes;  \n(b) the disclosure of management-defined performance measures. Management-defined performance measures\nare alternative or non-GAAP performance measures (that is, measures that are not defined by Australian\nAccounting Standards) that are subtotals of income and expenses used in public communications. AASB 18\nrequires disclosure of reconciliation between those measures and the subtotals required by AASB Standards;\nand  \n(c) enhanced requirements for grouping (aggregation and disaggregation) of information. AASB 18 provides\nguidance for entities on grouping transactions and other events into the line items in the primary financial\nstatements and information disclosed in the notes. These principles generally require entities to:  \n(i) aggregate items that share characteristics and disaggregate items that have different characteristics;  \n(ii) group items in a way that does not obscure material information or reduce the understandability of\nthe information presented; and  \n(iii) place items in the primary financial statements and the notes to fulfil their complementary roles.  \nIn combination, these three key sets of requirements strike a balance by introducing defined subtotals that create a\nconsistent structure in the statement of profit or loss to provide a starting point for analysis, while leaving room for\nentities to report their own performance measures. The disclosure requirements for management-defined performance\nmeasures anchor entities\u2019 own performance measures to the defined subtotals, increasing the transparency of these\nmeasures.

This\nStandard also sets out requirements for the disclosure of information in the notes. AASB 107 Statement of\n_Cash Flows sets out requirements for the presentation and disclosure of cash flow information. However, the_\ngeneral requirements for financial statements in paragraphs 9\u201343 and 113\u2013114 apply to the statement of cash\nflows.  \n4 Other Australian Accounting Standards set out the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure\nrequirements for specific transactions and other events.  \n5 This Standard does not apply to the presentation and disclosure of information in condensed interim financial\nstatements prepared applying AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting. However, paragraphs 41\u201345 and 117\u2013\n125 apply to such financial statements.  \n6 This Standard uses terminology that is suitable for profit-oriented entities, including public sector business\nentities. If entities with not-for-profit activities in the private sector or the public sector apply this Standard,\nthey may need to amend the descriptions used for particular line items, categories, subtotals or totals in the\nfinancial statements and for the financial statements themselves.  \n7 Similarly, entities that do not have equity as defined in AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation (for\nexample, some mutual funds) and entities whose share capital is not equity (for example, some co-operative\nentities) may need to adapt the financial statement presentation of members\u2019 or unitholders\u2019 interests.  \n8 Many entities provide a financial review by management, which is separate from the financial statements (see\nparagraph 10), that describes and explains the main features of the entity\u2019s financial performance and financial\nposition, as well as the principal uncertainties it faces. Such a review is outside the scope of Australian\nAccounting Standards.  \n-----  ",

However, it need not provide the\nrelated notes to the statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period.  \n40 The date of that third statement of financial position shall be as at the beginning of the preceding period\nregardless of whether an entity\u2019s financial statements provide comparative information for earlier periods (as\npermitted by paragraphs B14\u2013B15).",

Such information\nincludes information about raw material expense, employee benefit expense, depreciation and amortisation.  \n81 In classifying expenses by function within the entity, an entity allocates and aggregates operating expenses\naccording to the activity to which the consumed resource relates. For example, cost of sales is a function line\nitem that combines expenses relating to an entity\u2019s production or other revenue-generating activities such as:\nraw material expense, employee benefit expense, depreciation and amortisation. Therefore, when classifying\nexpenses by function, an entity might:  \n(a) allocate to several function line items (such as cost of sales and research and development) expenses\nrelating to economic resources of the same nature (such as employee benefit expense); and  \n(b) include in a single function line item an allocation of expenses relating to economic resources of\nseveral natures (such as raw material expense, employee benefit expense, depreciation and\namortisation).  \n82 If an entity presents one or more line items comprising expenses classified by function in the operating\ncategory of the statement of profit or loss, it shall:  \n(a) present a separate line item for its cost of sales, if the entity classifies operating expenses in functions\nthat include a cost of sales function. That line item shall include the total of inventory expense\ndescribed in paragraph 38 of AASB 102 Inventories.  \n(b) disclose a qualitative description of the nature of expenses included in each function line item.  \n**83** **An entity that presents one or more line items comprising expenses classified by function in the**\n**operating category of the statement of profit or loss shall also disclose in a single note:**  \n**(a)** **the total for each of:**  \n**(i)** **depreciation, comprising the amounts required to be disclosed by paragraph**\n**73(e)(vii) of AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraph 79(d)(iv) of AASB**\n**140 Investment Property and paragraph 53(a) of AASB 16 Leases;**  \n**(ii)** **amortisation, comprising the amount required to be disclosed by paragraph**\n**118(e)(vi) of AASB 138 Intangible Assets;**  \n**(iii)** **employee benefits, comprising the amount for employee benefits recognised by an**\n**entity applying AASB 119 Employee Benefits and the amount for services received**\n**from employees recognised by an entity applying AASB 2 Share-based Payment;**  \n**(iv)** **impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses, comprising the amounts**\n**required to be disclosed by paragraphs 126(a) and 126(b) of AASB 136 Impairment**\n**_of Assets; and_**  \n**(v)** **write-downs and reversals of write-downs of inventories, comprising the amounts**\n**required to be disclosed by paragraphs 36(e) and 36(f) of AASB 102; and**  \n**(b)** **for each total listed in (a)(i)\u2013(v):**  \n**(i)** **the amount related to each line item in the operating category (see paragraph B84);**\n**and**  \n**(ii)** **a list of any line items outside the operating category that also include amounts**\n**relating to the total.**  \n-----  84 Paragraph 41 requires an entity to disaggregate items to provide material information.

An entity assesses whether\ninformation, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its\nfinancial statements taken as a whole.  \nB3 Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users of\nfinancial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The following are examples of circumstances\nthat may result in material information being obscured:  \n(a) material information about an item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the financial statements\nbut the language used is vague or unclear;  \n(b) material information about an item, transaction or other event is scattered throughout the financial\nstatements;  \n(c) dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated;  \n(d) similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and  \n(e) the understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a result of material information being\nhidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what\ninformation is material.  \nB4 Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users\nof a specific reporting entity\u2019s general purpose financial statements requires an entity to consider the\ncharacteristics of those users while also considering the entity\u2019s own circumstances.  \nB5 Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to provide\ninformation directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial\ninformation they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose financial statements\nare directed. Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and\neconomic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At times, even well-informed and\ndiligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex economic\nphenomena.",

Paragraphs B78 and B110 set out examples of characteristics an entity considers in\nmaking its judgements.  \nB20 The more similar the characteristics of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows are, the\nmore likely it is that aggregating them will fulfil the role of the primary financial statements (that is, to provide\nuseful structured summaries as described in paragraph 16) or the notes (that is, to provide material information\nas described in paragraph 17). The more dissimilar the characteristics of assets, liabilities, equity, income,\nexpenses and cash flows are, the more likely it is that disaggregating the items will fulfil the roles of the\nprimary financial statements or the notes.  \nB21 The items aggregated and presented as line items in the primary financial statements shall have at least one\nsimilar characteristic other than meeting the definition of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses or cash\nflows. However, because the role of the primary financial statements is to provide useful structured summaries,\nthe line items in the primary financial statements are also likely to aggregate items that have sufficiently\ndissimilar characteristics that information about the disaggregated items is material.  \nB22 Applying paragraph 41, an entity shall disaggregate items that have dissimilar characteristics when the\nresulting information is material. A single dissimilar characteristic could result in information about\ndisaggregated items being material.  \n-----  B23 For example, an entity might present in the statement of financial position financial assets that comprise equity\ninvestments and debt investments separately from non-financial assets. The financial assets have dissimilar\ncharacteristics because they have different measurement bases \u2013 some are measured at fair value through profit\nor loss and others at amortised cost. The entity might therefore determine that to provide a useful structured\nsummary it is necessary to present line items that disaggregate the financial assets based on those measurement\nbases. That disaggregation results in a line item comprising equity investments and debt investments measured\nat fair value through profit or loss and a line item comprising debt investments measured at amortised cost.\nBecause equity investments are dissimilar to debt investments in that each exposes the entity to different risks,\nthe entity would assess whether further disaggregation in the statement of financial position of financial assets\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss into equity investments and debt investments is needed to provide\na useful structured summary. If not, and if the resulting information were material, the entity would need to\ndisclose in the notes the equity investments separately from the debt investments. In addition if, for example,\nthe equity investments had other dissimilar characteristics, the entity would be required to disaggregate further\nthose equity investments in the notes if the resulting information were material.",

        "page_content=": "### Assessment of specified main business activities\nB30 Paragraph 49 requires an entity to assess whether it invests in assets or provides financing to customers as a\nmain business activity. An entity may have more than one main business activity. For example, an entity that\nmanufactures a product and also provides financing to customers may determine that both its manufacturing\nactivity and customer-finance activity are main business activities. To classify income and expenses into the\ncategories of operating, investing and financing as required by this Standard, an entity need only determine\nwhether either of, or both, investing in assets and providing financing to customers are main business\nactivities.  \nB31 Examples of entities that might invest in assets as a main business activity include:  \n(a) investment entities as defined by AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;  \n(b) investment property companies; and  \n(c) insurers.  \nB32 Examples of entities that might provide financing to customers as a main business activity include:  \n(a) banks and other lending institutions;  \n(b) entities that provide financing to customers to enable those customers to buy the entity\u2019s products;\nand  \n(c) lessors that provide financing to customers in finance leases.  \nB33 Whether investing in assets or providing financing to customers is a main business activity of the entity is a\nmatter of fact and not merely an assertion. An entity shall use its judgement to assess whether investing in  \n-----  assets or providing financing to customers is a main business activity and that assessment shall be based on\nevidence.  \nB34 In general, investing in assets or providing financing to customers is likely to be a main business activity of\nan entity if the entity uses a particular type of subtotal as an important indicator of operating performance. The\nparticular type of subtotal is a subtotal similar to gross profit (see paragraph B123) that includes income and\nexpenses that would be classified in the investing or financing categories if investing in assets or providing\nfinancing to customers were not main business activities.  \nB35 Evidence that subtotals similar to gross profit described in paragraph B123 are important indicators of\noperating performance includes using such subtotals to:  \n(a) explain operating performance externally; or  \n(b) assess or monitor operating performance internally.  \nB36 Information about segments may provide evidence that investing in assets or providing financing to customers\nis a main business activity if an entity applies AASB 8 Operating Segments. Specifically:  \n(a) if a reportable segment comprises a single business activity, this indicates that the performance of\nthe reportable segment is an important indicator of the entity\u2019s operating performance and that the\nbusiness activity of the reportable segment is a main business activity of the entity; and  \n(b) if an operating segment comprises a single business activity, this indicates that the business activity\nmight be a main business activity of the entity if the performance of the operating segment is an\nimportant indicator of the entity\u2019s operating performance as described in paragraph B34.  \nB37 An entity shall assess whether investing in assets or providing financing to customers is a main business\nactivity for the reporting entity as a whole. Accordingly, the assessment of whether investing in assets or\nproviding financing to customers is a main business activity by a reporting entity that is a consolidated group\nand a reporting entity that is one of the subsidiaries in the consolidated group could have different outcomes.  \nB38 An entity shall assess whether it invests as a main business activity in associates, joint ventures and\nunconsolidated subsidiaries not accounted for using the equity method (see paragraphs B43(b)\u2013(c) and\nB44(b)\u2013(c)) by individual asset or using groups of assets with shared characteristics. If an entity prepares\nseparate financial statements as specified in AASB 127 _Separate Financial Statements and performs the_\nassessment for groups of assets, the entity shall use groups of assets that are consistent with the categories\nused to determine their measurement basis applying paragraph 10 of AASB 127. An entity need not assess\nwhether it invests as a main business activity in associates, joint ventures and non-consolidated subsidiaries\naccounted for using the equity method (see paragraphs B43(a) and B44(a)) because it is required to classify\nthe income and expenses from those investments in the investing category (see paragraph 55(a)).  \nB39 An entity need not assess whether it invests as a main business activity in cash and cash equivalents (see\nparagraph 53(b)). An entity is required to classify income and expenses from cash and cash equivalents in the\ninvesting category unless paragraphs 56(a) or 56(b) apply.  \nB40 An entity shall assess whether it invests as a main business activity in other assets that generate a return\nindividually and largely independently of the entity\u2019s other resources (see paragraph 53(c)) by assessing an\nindividual asset or groups of assets with shared characteristics. When performing the assessment for groups\nof financial assets an entity shall use groups of financial assets that are consistent with the classes of financial\nassets identified by the entity in applying paragraph 6 of AASB 7.  \nB41 An entity shall assess whether investing in assets or providing financing to customers is a main business\nactivity based on the facts at the time, so a change in the outcome of the assessment does not change the\noutcome of the previous assessments. Accordingly, an entity classifies and presents income and expenses\napplying the change in the outcome of the assessment prospectively from the date of the change and does not\nreclassify amounts presented before the date of the change. Unless it is impracticable to do so, paragraph\n51(c)(ii) requires an entity to disclose the amount and classification of items of income and expense before\nand after the date of the change in the outcome of the assessment in the current period and the amount and\nclassification in the prior period for items for which the classification has changed because of the change in\nthe outcome of the assessment.",

Such liabilities include:  \n(a) payables for goods or services that will be settled in cash \u2013 an entity receives goods or services, not\nfinance in the form described in paragraph B50(a);  \n(b) contract liabilities \u2013 an entity will return goods and services, not cash or its own equity instruments\nas described in paragraph B50(b);  \n(c) lease liabilities \u2013 an entity receives a right-of-use asset, not finance in the form described in\nparagraph B50(a);  \n(d) defined benefit pension liabilities \u2013 an entity receives employee services, not finance in the form\ndescribed in paragraph B50(a);  \n-----  (e) decommissioning or asset restoration provisions \u2013 an entity receives an asset that is not finance in\nthe form described in paragraph B50(a); and  \n(f) a litigation provision \u2013 an entity does not receive finance as described in paragraph B50(a).  \nB54 Examples of income and expenses from such liabilities that paragraph 61 requires an entity to classify in the\nfinancing category include:  \n(a) interest expenses on payables arising from the purchase of goods or services, applying AASB 9;  \n(b) interest expenses on a contract liability with a significant financing component as specified by\nAASB 15;  \n(c) interest expenses on a lease liability, applying AASB 16;  \n(d) net interest expense (income) on a net defined benefit liability (asset), applying AASB 119; and  \n(e) the increase in the discounted amount of a provision arising from the passage of time and the effect\nof any change in the discount rate on provisions, applying AASB 137.  \nB55 Examples of income and expenses that arise from transactions that do not involve only the raising of finance\nbut that are not in the scope of paragraph 61, and accordingly are classified in the operating category, include:  \n(a) expenses recognised for consumption of the purchased goods or services described in paragraph\nB54(a);  \n(b) current and past service cost arising from a defined benefit plan, applying AASB 119; and  \n(c) remeasurements of the fair value of a liability for contingent consideration in a business combination\nrecognised applying AASB 3 Business Combinations.  \n_Classification of income and expenses from hybrid contracts containing a host that is_\n_a liability_  \nB56 How an entity classifies income and expenses from a hybrid contract with a host that is a liability depends on\nwhether the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract. If the embedded derivative:  \n(a) is separated from the host liability:  \n(i) for the separated host liability \u2013 an entity applies the requirements for income and\nexpenses from liabilities, as specified in paragraphs 52, 59\u201361, 64(b) and 65\u201366; and  \n(ii) for the separated embedded derivative \u2013 an entity applies the requirements for income\nand expenses from derivatives, as specified in paragraphs B70\u2013B76;  \n(b) is not separated from the host liability and if the hybrid contract arises from a transaction that\ninvolves only the raising of finance \u2013 an entity applies the requirements for liabilities that arise from\nsuch transactions, as specified in paragraphs 52, 60 and 65\u201366;  \n(c) is not separated from the host liability and if the hybrid contract does not arise from a transaction\nthat involves only the raising of finance:  \n(i) if the host liability is a financial liability within the scope of AASB 9 that is measured at\namortised cost \u2013 an entity classifies in the financing category income and expenses\nspecified in paragraph 60 from the contract after initial recognition (instead of the income\nand expenses specified in paragraph 61) (see paragraph B59);  \n(ii) if the hybrid contract is an insurance contract within the scope of AASB 17 \u2013 an entity\napplies the requirements in paragraphs 52 and 64(b); and  \n(iii) otherwise \u2013 an entity applies the requirements for income and expenses from liabilities\nthat arise from such transactions, as specified in paragraphs 52 and 61.  \nB57 An entity shall apply paragraphs B56(b) and B56(c) to all hybrid contracts containing a host liability for which\nthe embedded derivative is not separated, regardless of whether the embedded derivative is not separated by\nthe entity applying paragraph 4.3.3 of AASB 9 or applying paragraph 4.3.5 of AASB 9.  \n_Liabilities arising from issued investment contracts with participation features_  \nB58 Paragraph 64(a) sets out requirements for income and expenses from liabilities arising from issued investment\ncontracts with participation features recognised applying AASB 9. Examples of such investment contracts are:  \n(a) an investment contract with participation features issued by an insurer that does not meet the\ndefinition in AASB 17 of an investment contract with discretionary participation features; and  \n-----  (b) an investment contract with participation features issued by an investment entity.  \n_Income and expenses classified in the operating category by an entity that provides_\n_financing to customers as a main business activity_  \nB59 Paragraph 65 requires an entity that provides financing to customers as a main business activity to classify in\nthe operating category income and expenses from some or all liabilities that arise from transactions that\ninvolve only the raising of finance. An entity shall also apply the requirements in that paragraph to income\nand expenses from a derivative relating to a transaction that involves only the raising of finance specified in\nparagraph B73(a), but not to the income and expenses from a hybrid contract specified in paragraph B56(c)(i).",

An entity shall classify income and expenses on the derecognition of an asset,\nor its classification as held for sale and any subsequent measurement while held for sale, in the same category\nas it classified the income and expenses from the asset immediately before its derecognition. For example, an\nentity shall classify gains and losses:  \n(a) on the disposal of property, plant and equipment \u2013 in the operating category;  \n(b) on the disposal of an investment property that an entity does not invest in as a main business activity\n\u2013 in the investing category; and  \n(c) from the remeasurement of an investment in an associate previously accounted for using the equity\nmethod on the step acquisition of a subsidiary \u2013 in the investing category.  \nB61 An entity shall classify income and expenses from the derecognition of a liability by applying the requirements\nin paragraphs 52 and 59\u201360. For example, the entity classifies income and expenses from the derecognition\nof a liability:  \n(a) in the financing category \u2013 if the liability arises from a transaction that involves only the raising of\nfinance by an entity that does not provide financing to customers as a main business activity; and  \n(b) in the operating category \u2013 if as part of a supplier finance arrangement an entity derecognises a\npayable to a supplier and recognises a liability under that arrangement.  \n_Change in use of an asset_  \nB62 A transaction or other event might change the category in the statement of profit or loss in which an entity\nclassifies income and expenses from an asset, without the asset being derecognised. In such cases, an entity\nshall classify the income and expenses from the transaction or other event in the category in which it classified\nincome and expenses from the asset immediately before the transaction or event. For example, an entity shall\nclassify in the operating category any income or expenses recognised in the statement of profit or loss on the\ntransfer of property from the scope of AASB 116 to investment property in the scope of AASB 140.  \n_Groups of assets and liabilities_  \nB63 Paragraphs B60\u2013B62 set out requirements for income and expenses from an asset or liability from its\nderecognition, classification and subsequent measurement while held for sale, or from its change in use. A\ntransaction or other event might result in these outcomes for a group of assets (or a group of assets and\nliabilities) that generated income and expenses that an entity classified in different categories immediately\nbefore the transaction or other event. An entity shall classify income or expenses from such a transaction or\nother event:  \n(a) in the investing category if, other than any income tax assets, all the assets in the group generated\nincome and expenses that the entity classified in the investing category immediately before the\ntransaction or other event; and  \n(b) in the operating category otherwise.  \nB64 For example, an entity classifies:  \n(a) in the operating category \u2013 gains and losses on the disposal of a consolidated subsidiary, if the\nsubsidiary included assets that generated income and expenses that the entity classified in the  \n-----  operating category immediately before the disposal. The gains and losses include the reclassification\nfrom equity to profit or loss of foreign exchange differences required by paragraph 48 of AASB 121.  \n(b) in the operating category \u2013 an impairment loss arising on the classification of a disposal group as\nheld for sale by the entity applying AASB 5, if the disposal group included assets that generated\nincome and expenses that the entity classified in the operating category immediately before its\nclassification as held for sale.  \n(c) in the investing category \u2013 gains and losses on disposal of a consolidated subsidiary, if the only\nassets of the subsidiary were investment property that the consolidated reporting entity did not invest\nin as a main business activity and related income tax assets. The gains and losses include the\nreclassification from equity to profit or loss of foreign exchange differences required by paragraph\n48 of AASB 121.  \n**Classification of foreign exchange differences and the gain or loss on the net**\n**monetary position**  \nB65 To apply paragraph 47, an entity shall classify foreign exchange differences included in the statement of profit\nor loss applying AASB 121 in the same category as the income and expenses from the items that gave rise to\nthe foreign exchange differences, unless doing so would involve undue cost or effort (see paragraph B68).  \nB66 For example, an entity classifies foreign exchange differences on:  \n(a) a receivable described in paragraph B48(b) denominated in a foreign currency, in the same category\nas the income and expenses from that asset \u2013 that is, in the operating category; and  \n(b) a debt instrument that is a liability described in paragraph B51(a) denominated in a foreign currency,\nin the same category as the income and expenses on that liability \u2013 that is, in the financing category\n(unless the entity provides financing to customers as a main business activity and classifies the\nincome and expenses from the liability in the operating category applying paragraph 65).  \nB67 An entity might classify in more than one category income and expenses from a transaction that does not\ninvolve only the raising of finance. For example, the purchase of services in a transaction denominated in a\nforeign currency and negotiated on extended credit terms could give rise to an expense for the purchase of the\nservices classified in the operating category (see paragraph B55(a)) and interest expenses classified in the\nfinancing category (see paragraph B54(a)). In such cases, subject to paragraph B68, an entity shall use its\njudgement to determine whether the foreign exchange difference relates to the amount classified in the\nfinancing category \u2013 and classify it in that category \u2013 or whether it relates to the amount classified in another\ncategory \u2013 and classify it in that category. An entity shall not allocate between categories a foreign exchange\ndifference arising on a liability from a transaction that does not involve only the raising of finance. In making\nits judgements about how to classify the foreign exchange differences, an entity need not classify in the same\ncategory the foreign exchange differences on all such liabilities. However, an entity shall classify in the same\ncategory foreign exchange differences on similar liabilities.  \nB68 If applying the requirements in paragraphs B65 and B67 would involve undue cost or effort, an entity shall\ninstead classify the affected foreign exchange differences in the operating category. An entity shall assess\nwhether classifying foreign exchange differences as described in paragraphs B65 and B67 involves undue cost\nor effort for each item that gives rise to foreign exchange differences. The assessment is specific to the facts\nand circumstances related to each item. If the same facts and circumstances relate to a number of items, an\nentity could apply the same assessment to each of the items.  \nB69 Applying paragraph 28 of AASB 129 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, an entity might\npresent the gain or loss on the net monetary position with other income and expense items associated with the\nnet monetary position, such as interest income and expenses and foreign exchange differences. If the entity\ndoes not present the gain or loss on the net monetary position with the associated income and expenses, it shall\nclassify the gain or loss in the operating category.  \n**Classification of gains and losses on derivatives and designated hedging**\n**instruments**  \nB70 Paragraph 47 requires an entity to classify income and expenses in categories in the statement of profit or loss.\nTo apply paragraph 47, an entity shall classify gains and losses included in the statement of profit or loss on a\nfinancial instrument designated as a hedging instrument applying AASB 9 in the same category as the income\nand expenses affected by the risks the financial instrument is used to manage. However, if doing so would\nrequire the grossing up of gains and losses, an entity shall classify all such gains and losses in the operating\ncategory (see paragraphs B74\u2013B75).  \n-----  B71 An entity shall classify gains and losses on an undesignated component of a designated hedging instrument in\nthe same category as gains and losses on the designated component. An entity shall classify ineffective\nportions of a gain or loss in the same category as the effective portions.  \nB72 An entity shall also apply the requirements in paragraph B70 to gains and losses on a derivative that is not\ndesignated as a hedging instrument applying AASB 9, but is used to manage identified risks. However, if\ndoing so would require the grossing up of gains or losses (see paragraphs B74\u2013B75) or involve undue cost or\neffort, the entity shall instead classify all gains and losses on the derivative in the operating category.  \nB73 An entity shall classify gains and losses on a derivative that is not used to manage identified risks:  \n(a) in the financing category, if the derivative relates to a transaction that involves only the raising of\nfinance (for example, a purchased call option that allows the issuing entity to exchange a fixed\namount of a foreign currency for a fixed number of the entity\u2019s equity instruments), unless the entity\nthat provides financing to customers as a main business activity classifies the gains and losses in\nthe operating category applying paragraph B59; and  \n(b) in the operating category, if the conditions in (a) are not met.  \nB74 Paragraphs B70 and B72 prohibit the grossing up of gains and losses on financial instruments designated as\nhedging instruments and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The grossing up of gains and\nlosses might arise from situations in which:  \n(a) an entity uses such financial instruments to manage the risks of a group of items with offsetting risk\npositions (see paragraph 6.6.1 of AASB 9 for the criteria for a group of items to be an eligible\nhedged item); and  \n(b) the risks managed affect line items in more than one category of the statement of profit or loss.  \nB75 For example, an entity may use a derivative to manage both the net foreign currency risk on revenue (classified\nin the operating category) and interest expenses (classified in the financing category). In such cases, the foreign\nexchange differences on the revenue are offset by the foreign exchange differences on the interest expenses\nand the gains or losses on the derivative. However, the entity classifies the foreign exchange differences on\nthe revenue in a different category from the foreign exchange differences on the interest expenses. To present\nthe gain or loss on the derivative in each category, an entity would need to present in each category a larger\ngain or loss than occurred on the derivative. Applying the requirements in paragraphs B70\u2013B73, an entity\nshall not gross up the gains or losses in this manner and instead shall classify any gain or loss on the derivative\nin the operating category.  \nB76 The requirements in paragraphs B70\u2013B75 specify only how to classify income and expenses into categories\nof the statement of profit or loss. They do not prescribe the line item (or line items) in which to include such\nincome and expenses, nor do they override the requirements in other Australian Accounting Standards.",

For example, an entity that\ndoes not invest in assets or provide financing to customers as a main business activity may be required to\npresent the line item specified in paragraph 75(b)(ii) of impairment losses determined in accordance with\nSection 5.5 of AASB 9 in:  \n(a) the operating category \u2013 if it relates to receivables for goods and services as described in paragraph\nB48(b); and  \n(b) the investing category \u2013 if it relates to financial assets that generate a return individually and largely\nindependently of the entity\u2019s other resources as described in paragraph B46.  \nB78 Paragraphs 24 and 41(c) require an entity to present additional line items in the statement of profit or loss if\ndoing so is necessary to provide a useful structured summary of the entity\u2019s income and expenses. An entity\nuses its judgement to make this determination (including whether it is necessary to disaggregate the line items\nlisted in paragraph 75). Paragraphs 20 and 41(d) require an entity to disaggregate items to disclose material\ninformation in the notes. An entity also uses its judgement to make this determination. Paragraph 41 requires\nthe entity to base its judgements on an assessment of whether the items have characteristics that are shared\n(similar characteristics) or characteristics that are not shared (dissimilar characteristics). Such characteristics\ninclude:  \n(a) nature (see paragraph 80);  \n(b) function (role) within the entity\u2019s business activities (see paragraph 81);  \n-----  (c) persistence (including the frequency of the item of income or expense or whether it is recurring or\nnon-recurring);  \n(d) measurement basis;  \n(e) measurement uncertainty or outcome uncertainty (or other risks associated with an item);  \n(f) size;  \n(g) geographical location or regulatory environment;  \n(h) tax effects (for example, if different tax rates apply to items of income or expense); and  \n(i) whether the income or expenses arise on initial recognition of a transaction or event or from a\nsubsequent change in estimate relating to the transaction or event.  \nB79 Income and expenses that might have sufficiently dissimilar characteristics that presentation in the statement\nof profit or loss is necessary to provide a useful structured summary or disclosure in the notes is necessary to\nprovide material information include:  \n(a) write-downs of inventories, as well as reversals of such write-downs;  \n(b) impairment losses for property, plant and equipment, as well as reversals of such impairment losses;  \n(c) income and expenses from restructurings of an entity\u2019s activities and reversals of any provisions for\nrestructuring;  \n(d) income and expenses from disposals of property, plant and equipment;  \n(e) income and expenses from disposals of investments;  \n(f) income and expenses from litigation settlements;  \n(g) reversals of provisions; and  \n(h) non-recurring income and expenses not included in (a)\u2013(g).",

        "page_content=": "### Presentation and disclosure of expenses classified in the operating category\n_Use of characteristics of nature and function_  \nB80 In determining how to use the characteristics of nature and function to provide the most useful structured\nsummary as required by paragraph 78, an entity shall consider:  \n(a) what line items provide the most useful information about the main components or drivers of the\nentity\u2019s profitability. For example, for a retail entity a main component or driver of profitability\nmight be cost of sales. Presenting a cost of sales line item might provide relevant information about\nwhether the revenue generated from the sale of goods covers what, for retailers, are mainly direct\ncosts, and by what margin. However, cost of sales is unlikely to provide relevant information about\nthe important components or drivers of profitability if the link between revenue and costs is less\ndirect. For example, for some service entities, information about operating expenses classified by\nnature, such as employee benefits, might be more relevant to users of financial statements because\nthese expenses are the main drivers of profitability.  \n(b) what line items most closely represent the way the business is managed and how management\nreports internally. For example, a manufacturing entity managed on the basis of major functions\nmight classify expenses by function for internal reporting purposes. In contrast, an entity that has a\nsingle predominant function, such as providing financing to customers, might determine that line\nitems comprising expenses classified by nature provide the most useful information for internal\nreporting purposes.  \n(c) what standard industry practice entails. If expenses are classified in the same way by entities in an\nindustry, users of financial statements can more easily compare expenses between entities in the\nsame industry.  \n(d) whether the allocation of particular expenses to functions would be arbitrary to the extent that the\nline items presented would not provide a faithful representation of the functions. In such cases, an\nentity shall classify these expenses by nature.  \nB81 In some cases, an entity considering the factors set out in paragraph B80 could determine that classifying and\npresenting some expenses by nature and other expenses by function provides the most useful structured\nsummary. For example:  \n-----  (a) the factors in paragraphs B80(a)\u2013(b) might indicate that classifying and presenting expenses by\nfunction provides the most useful structured summary, except for particular expenses for which the\nallocation to functions would be arbitrary (see paragraph B80(d)); and  \n(b) an entity having two different types of main business activities might classify and present some\nexpenses by function and other expenses by nature to provide information about the main drivers\nof its profitability.  \nB82 If an entity classifies and presents some expenses by nature and other expenses by function in the statement\nof profit or loss, it shall label the resulting line items in a way that clearly identifies what expenses are included\nin each line item. For example, if an entity includes some employee benefits in a function line item and other\nemployee benefits in a nature line item, the label for the nature line item would clearly identify that it does not\ninclude all employee benefits (for example, \u2018employee benefits other than those included in cost of sales\u2019).  \nB83 Applying paragraph 30, an entity shall classify and present expenses consistently from one reporting period\nto the next unless paragraphs 30(a) or 30(b) apply. For example, if an entity presents impairment of goodwill\nas a nature line item in one reporting period, it shall also present any similar impairment of goodwill as a\nnature line item in subsequent reporting periods unless paragraphs 30(a) or 30(b) apply. If there is no similar\nimpairment of goodwill in a subsequent period, the fact that there is an expense of nil in that subsequent period\ndoes not constitute a change in classification and presentation.  \nB84 An entity will either present expenses by nature, or applying paragraph 83, disclose some expenses by nature.\nThe amounts presented or disclosed need not be the amounts recognised as an expense in the period. They\ncould include amounts that have been recognised as part of the carrying amount of an asset. If an entity:  \n(a) presents amounts that are not the amounts recognised as an expense in the period, it will also present\nan additional line item for the change in the carrying amount of the affected assets. For example,\napplying paragraph 39 of AASB 102, an entity might present a line item for changes in inventories\nof finished goods and work in progress.  \n(b) discloses, applying paragraph 83(b), amounts that are not the amounts recognised as an expense in\nthe period, the entity shall give a qualitative explanation of that fact, identifying the assets involved.  \n_Aggregation of operating expenses_  \nB85 To apply paragraph 78, an entity shall consider what level of aggregation for operating expenses provides the\nmost useful structured summary. For example, an entity might have various administrative activities (such as\nhuman resources, information technology, legal and accounting). To provide a useful structured summary, the\nentity might aggregate operating expenses relating to those activities based on their shared characteristic \u2013 all\nare expenses for resources consumed in administrative activities. Accordingly the entity might present them\nin a line item labelled as \u2018administrative expenses\u2019. The entity might also have expenses for resources\nconsumed in selling activities. These expenses have a dissimilar characteristic from the administrative\nexpenses \u2013 selling expenses arise from resources consumed in selling activities and administrative expenses\narise from resources consumed in administrative activities. These characteristics are sufficiently dissimilar\nthat disaggregation \u2013 presentation in separate line items for selling expenses and administrative expenses \u2013\nmight be necessary to provide a useful structured summary of the entity\u2019s expenses.",

The components of other comprehensive income include:  \n(a) changes in revaluation surplus (see AASB 116 and AASB 138);  \n(b) remeasurements of defined benefit plans (see AASB 119);  \n(c) gains and losses arising from translating the financial statements of a foreign operation (see\nAASB 121);  \n(d) gains and losses from investments in equity instruments designated at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9;  \n(e) gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in\naccordance with paragraph 4.1.2A of AASB 9;  \n(f) the effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge and the gains\nand losses on hedging instruments that hedge investments in equity instruments designated at fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9 (see\nChapter 6 of AASB 9);  \n(g) for particular liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of the change\nin fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability\u2019s credit risk (see paragraph 5.7.7 of\nAASB 9);  \n(h) changes in the value of the time value of options when separating the intrinsic value and time value\nof an option contract and designating as the hedging instrument only the changes in the intrinsic\nvalue (see Chapter 6 of AASB 9);  \n(i) changes in the value of the forward elements of forward contracts when separating the forward\nelement and spot element of a forward contract and designating as the hedging instrument only the\nchanges in the spot element, and changes in the value of the foreign currency basis spread of a\nfinancial instrument when excluding it from the designation of that financial instrument as the\nhedging instrument (see Chapter 6 of AASB 9);  \n(j) insurance finance income and expenses from contracts issued within the scope of AASB 17\nexcluded from profit or loss when total insurance finance income or expenses is disaggregated to\ninclude in profit or loss an amount determined by a systematic allocation applying paragraph 88(b)\nof AASB 17, or by an amount that eliminates accounting mismatches with the finance income or\nexpenses arising on the underlying items, applying paragraph 89(b) of AASB 17; and  \n(k) finance income and expenses from reinsurance contracts held excluded from profit or loss when\ntotal reinsurance finance income or expenses is disaggregated to include in profit or loss an amount\ndetermined by a systematic allocation, applying paragraph 88(b) of AASB 17.  \nB88 Reclassification adjustments arise, for example, on disposal of a foreign operation (see AASB 121) and when\nsome hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss (see paragraph 6.5.11(d) of AASB 9 in relation to cash\nflow hedges).  \nB89 Paragraph 90 requires an entity to present in the statement presenting comprehensive income or disclose in\nthe notes reclassification adjustments relating to components of other comprehensive income. Reclassification\nadjustments do not arise on changes in revaluation surplus recognised in accordance with AASB 116 or\nAASB 138 or on remeasurements of defined benefit plans recognised in accordance with AASB 119. An\nentity recognises these components in other comprehensive income and does not reclassify them to profit or\nloss in subsequent reporting periods. An entity may transfer changes in revaluation surplus to retained earnings\nin subsequent periods as the asset is used or when it is derecognised (see AASB 116 and AASB 138). In\naccordance with AASB 9, reclassification adjustments do not arise if a cash flow hedge or the accounting for\nthe time value of an option (or the forward element of a forward contract or the foreign currency basis spread\nof a financial instrument) results in amounts that an entity removes from the cash flow hedge reserve or a\nseparate component of equity, respectively, and includes directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount\nof an asset or a liability. An entity transfers these amounts directly to assets or liabilities.  \nAusCF1 The Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements was amended by the AASB in December 2013.  \n-----  ",

Such separate classification also\nhighlights assets that an entity expects to realise within the current operating cycle and liabilities that are due\nfor settlement within the same period.  \nB91 For some entities, such as financial institutions, a presentation of assets and liabilities in increasing or\ndecreasing order of liquidity provides a more useful structured summary than a current/non-current\npresentation because the entity does not supply goods or services within a clearly identifiable operating cycle.  \nB92 In applying paragraph 96, an entity is permitted to present some of its assets and liabilities using a current/noncurrent classification and others in order of liquidity when doing so provides a more useful structured\nsummary. The need for a mixed basis of presentation might arise when an entity has diverse operations.  \nB93 Information about expected dates of realisation of assets and liabilities is useful in assessing the liquidity and\nsolvency of an entity. AASB 7 requires disclosure of the maturity analysis of financial assets and financial\nliabilities. Financial assets include trade and other receivables, and financial liabilities include trade and other\npayables. Information on the expected date of recovery of non-monetary assets, such as inventories, and the\nexpected date of settlement for liabilities, such as provisions, is also useful, whether assets and liabilities are\nclassified as current or as non-current. For example, an entity discloses in the notes the amount of inventories\nthat it expects to recover more than 12 months after the reporting period.",

        "page_content=": "### Current liabilities\n_Normal operating cycle (see paragraph 101(a))_  \nB96 Some current liabilities, such as trade payables and some accruals for employee and other operating costs, are\npart of the working capital used in an entity\u2019s normal operating cycle. An entity classifies such items as current\nliabilities even if they are due to be settled more than 12 months after the reporting period. The same normal\noperating cycle applies to the classification of the entity\u2019s assets and liabilities. When the entity\u2019s normal\noperating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be 12 months.  \n_Held primarily for the purpose of trading (see paragraph 101(b)) or due to be settled_\n_within 12 months (see paragraph 101(c))_  \nB97 Other current liabilities are not settled as part of the normal operating cycle, but are due for settlement within\n12 months after the reporting period or held primarily for the purpose of trading. Examples are some financial\nliabilities that meet the definition of held for trading in AASB 9, bank overdrafts, and the current portion of\nnon-current financial liabilities, dividends payable, income taxes and other non-trade payables. Financial\nliabilities that provide financing on a long-term basis (that is, are not part of the working capital used in the\nentity\u2019s normal operating cycle) and are not due for settlement within 12 months after the reporting period are\nnon-current liabilities, subject to paragraphs B99\u2013B103.  \nB98 An entity classifies its financial liabilities as current when they are due to be settled within 12 months after\nthe reporting period, even if:  \n-----  (a) the original term was for a period longer than 12 months; and  \n(b) an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the\nreporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue.  \n_Right to defer settlement for at least 12 months (paragraph 101(d))_  \nB99 An entity\u2019s right to defer settlement of a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period must have\nsubstance and, as illustrated in paragraphs B100\u2013B103, must exist at the end of the reporting period.  \nB100 An entity\u2019s right to defer settlement of a liability arising from a loan arrangement for at least 12 months after\nthe reporting period may be subject to the entity complying with conditions specified in that loan arrangement\n(hereafter referred to as \u2018covenants\u2019). For the purposes of applying paragraph 101(d), such covenants:  \n(a) affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period \u2013 as illustrated in paragraphs B102\u2013\nB103 \u2013 if an entity is required to comply with the covenant on or before the end of the reporting\nperiod. Such a covenant affects whether the right exists at the end of the reporting period even if\ncompliance with the covenant is assessed only after the reporting period (for example, a covenant\nbased on the entity\u2019s financial position at the end of the reporting period but assessed for compliance\nonly after the reporting period).  \n(b) do not affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period if an entity is required to\ncomply with the covenant only after the reporting period (for example, a covenant based on the\nentity\u2019s financial position six months after the end of the reporting period).  \nB101 If an entity has the right, at the end of the reporting period, to roll over an obligation for at least 12 months\nafter the reporting period under an existing loan facility, it classifies the obligation as non-current, even if it\nwould otherwise be due within a shorter period. If the entity has no such right, the entity does not consider the\npotential to refinance the obligation and classifies the obligation as current.  \nB102 When an entity breaches a covenant of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end of the reporting\nperiod with the effect that the liability becomes payable on demand, it classifies the liability as current, even\nif the lender agreed, after the reporting period and before the authorisation of the financial statements for issue,\nnot to demand payment as a consequence of the breach. The entity classifies the liability as current because,\nat the end of the reporting period, it does not have the right to defer its settlement for at least 12 months after\nthat date.  \nB103 However, an entity classifies the liability as non-current if the lender agreed by the end of the reporting period\nto provide a period of grace ending at least 12 months after the reporting period, within which the entity can\nrectify the breach and during which the lender cannot demand immediate repayment.  \nB104 Classification of a liability is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer\nsettlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. If a liability meets the criteria in\nparagraphs 101\u2013102 for classification as non-current, it is classified as non-current even if management\nintends or expects the entity to settle the liability within 12 months after the reporting period, or even if the\nentity settles the liability between the end of the reporting period and the date the financial statements are\nauthorised for issue. However, in either of those circumstances, the entity may need to disclose information\nabout the timing of settlement to enable users of financial statements to understand the impact of the liability\non the entity\u2019s financial position (see paragraphs 6C(c) of AASB 108 and B105(d)).  \nB105 If the following events occur between the end of the reporting period and the date the financial statements are\nauthorised for issue, those events are disclosed as non-adjusting events in accordance with AASB 110 Events\n_after the Reporting Period:_  \n(a) refinancing on a long-term basis of a liability classified as current (see paragraph B98);  \n(b) rectification of a breach of a long-term loan arrangement classified as current (see paragraph B102);  \n(c) the granting by the lender of a period of grace to rectify a breach of a long-term loan arrangement\nclassified as current (see paragraph B103); and  \n(d) settlement of a liability classified as non-current (see paragraph B104).  \nB106 In applying paragraphs 101\u2013102 and B96\u2013B103 an entity might classify liabilities arising from loan\narrangements as non-current when the entity\u2019s right to defer settlement of those liabilities is subject to the\nentity complying with covenants within 12 months after the reporting period (see paragraph B100(b)). In such\nsituations, the entity shall disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial statements to\nunderstand the risk that the liabilities could become repayable within 12 months after the reporting period,\nincluding:  \n(a) information about the covenants (including the nature of the covenants and when the entity is\nrequired to comply with them) and the carrying amount of related liabilities.  \n-----  (b) facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have difficulty complying with the\ncovenants \u2013 for example, the entity having acted during or after the reporting period to avoid or\nmitigate a potential breach. Such facts and circumstances could also include the fact that the entity\nwould not have complied with the covenants if they were to be assessed for compliance based on\nthe entity\u2019s circumstances at the end of the reporting period.  \n_Settlement (paragraphs 101(a), 101(c) and 101(d))_  \nB107 For the purpose of classifying a liability as current or non-current, settlement refers to a transfer to the\ncounterparty that results in the extinguishment of the liability. The transfer could be of:  \n(a) cash or other economic resources \u2013 for example, goods or services; or  \n(b) the entity\u2019s own equity instruments, unless paragraph B108 applies.  \nB108 Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the transfer of the\nentity\u2019s own equity instruments do not affect its classification as current or non-current if, applying\nAASB 132, the entity classifies the option as an equity instrument, recognising it separately from the liability\nas an equity component of a compound financial instrument.",

An\nentity uses its judgement to make this determination (including whether it is necessary to disaggregate the line\nitems listed in paragraph 103).

        "page_content=": "### Identification of management-defined performance measures\nB113 Paragraph 117 defines management-defined performance measures. An entity might have no managementdefined performance measures, one management-defined performance measure or more than one. For\nexample, an entity that publicly communicates its financial performance to users of financial statements using\nonly totals and subtotals required to be presented or disclosed by Australian Accounting Standards does not\nhave a management-defined performance measure.  \nB114 To meet the definition of a management-defined performance measure, the measure must communicate to\nusers of financial statements management\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a\nwhole. For example, if a subtotal of income and expenses that relates to a reportable segment disclosed in\naccordance with AASB 8 does not provide information about an aspect of the financial performance of the\nentity as a whole, that subtotal cannot meet the definition of a management-defined performance measure.  \nB115 However, sometimes a subtotal of income and expenses that relates to a reportable segment could provide\ninformation about an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole. For example, if a reportable\nsegment contains a single main business activity of the entity and a subtotal of income and expenses relating\nto that segment is presented in the statement of profit or loss, that would indicate that the subtotal provides\ninformation about an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole. In such cases, a subtotal of\nincome and expenses related to that reportable segment would meet the definition of a management-defined\nperformance measure if it met the other parts of the definition of a management-defined performance measure.  \n-----  _Subtotals of income and expenses_  \nB116 A management-defined performance measure is a subtotal of income and expenses. Examples of measures\nthat are not management-defined performance measures because they are not subtotals of income and expenses\ninclude:  \n(a) subtotals of only income or only expenses (for example, a stand-alone measure of adjusted revenue\nthat is not part of a subtotal that also includes expenses);  \n(b) assets, liabilities, equity or combinations of these elements;  \n(c) financial ratios (for example, return on assets) (see paragraph B117);  \n(d) measures of liquidity or cash flows (for example, free cash flow); or  \n(e) non-financial performance measures.  \nB117 A financial ratio is not a management-defined performance measure because it is not a subtotal of income and\nexpenses. However, a subtotal that is the numerator or denominator in a financial ratio is a managementdefined performance measure if the subtotal would meet the definition of a management-defined performance\nmeasure if it were not part of a ratio. Accordingly, an entity shall apply the disclosure requirements in\nparagraphs 121\u2013125 to such a numerator or denominator.  \nB118 A subtotal of income and expenses that meets the definition of a management-defined performance measure\nin paragraph 117 is a management-defined performance measure whether or not it is presented in the statement\nof profit or loss.  \n_Public communications_  \nB119 A subtotal meets the definition of a management-defined performance measure only if an entity uses it in\npublic communications outside its financial statements. Public communications include management\ncommentary, press releases and investor presentations. For the purpose of defining management-defined\nperformance measures, public communications exclude oral communications, written transcripts of oral\ncommunications and social media posts.  \nB120 Management-defined performance measures relate to the same reporting period as the financial statements.\nSpecifically, a subtotal:  \n(a) relating to interim financial statements but not to the annual financial statements can only be a\nmanagement-defined performance measure in the interim financial statements; and  \n(b) relating to annual financial statements but not to interim financial statements can only be a\nmanagement-defined performance measure in the annual financial statements.  \nB121 An entity shall consider only public communications related to the reporting period to identify managementdefined performance measures for the reporting period, unless as part of its financial reporting process it\nroutinely issues such public communications after the date of issue of its financial statements. If that is the\ncase, an entity shall consider public communications related to the previous reporting period to identify\nmanagement-defined performance measures for the current reporting period.  \nB122 However, a measure used in the public communications related to the previous reporting period is not required\nto be identified as a management-defined performance measure for the current reporting period if there is\nevidence that indicates it will not be included in the public communications to be issued relating to the current\nreporting period. If such a measure had been disclosed as a management-defined performance measure in the\nprevious reporting period and is not identified as such for the current reporting period, that would be a change\nto, or a cessation of, a management-defined performance measure to which the disclosure requirements in\nparagraph 124 apply.  \n_Subtotals similar to gross profit_  \nB123 In accordance with paragraph 118(a), subtotals similar to gross profit are not management-defined\nperformance measures. A subtotal is similar to gross profit when it depicts the difference between a type of\nrevenue and directly related expenses incurred in generating that revenue. Examples include:  \n(a) net interest income;  \n(b) net fee and commission income;  \n(c) insurance service result;  \n(d) net financial result (investment income minus insurance finance income and expenses); and  \n-----  (e) net rental income.  \n_Presumption about communicating management\u2019s view_  \nB124 Paragraph 119 states that a subtotal of income and expenses used in public communications outside its\nfinancial statements is presumed to communicate to users of financial statements management\u2019s view of an\naspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole. Applying paragraph 120, an entity is permitted to\nrebut that presumption if it has reasonable and supportable information available that demonstrates that:  \n(a) the subtotal does not communicate to users of financial statements management\u2019s view of an aspect\nof the financial performance of the entity as a whole (see paragraphs B125\u2013B128); and  \n(b) the entity has a reason for using the subtotal in its public communications other than communicating\nmanagement\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole (see paragraph\nB129).  \nB125 Examples of reasonable and supportable information that demonstrate that a subtotal does not communicate\nto users of financial statements management\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial performance of an entity as\na whole are:  \n(a) an entity communicating the subtotal without prominence (see paragraph B126); and  \n(b) management not using the subtotal internally to assess or monitor the entity\u2019s financial performance\n(see paragraphs B127\u2013B128).  \nB126 Whether an entity communicates a subtotal without prominence is a matter of judgement based on a number\nof factors, for example:  \n(a) the extent of references to the subtotal \u2013 few references indicate a lack of prominence, numerous\nreferences indicate prominence; and  \n(b) the content of commentary or analysis about or relying on the subtotal, for example:  \n(i) a description of the subtotal as information that does not communicate management\u2019s\nview and that is provided only in response to frequent requests from some users of\nfinancial statements indicates a lack of prominence;  \n(ii) use of the subtotal to support management analysis and commentary on the entity\u2019s\nfinancial performance and to provide explanations of the reasons for changes in the\nsubtotal from period to period indicates prominence; and  \n(iii) a comparison of the subtotal to competitors\u2019 subtotals or industry benchmarks indicates\nprominence.  \nB127 Management\u2019s use of a subtotal to assess or monitor an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a\nwhole demonstrates that the subtotal communicates management\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial\nperformance of the entity as a whole. However, if management uses a subtotal internally but not in an entity\u2019s\npublic communications, the subtotal does not meet the definition of a management-defined performance\nmeasure.  \nB128 An entity might adjust a subtotal communicated in its public communications for use internally by\nmanagement to assess or monitor the entity\u2019s financial performance. In such cases, the entity shall use its\njudgement to assess whether the subtotal it uses internally is sufficiently similar to the subtotal it uses in its\npublic communications so that paragraph B127 applies. The more similar the subtotals are, the more likely it\nis that the subtotal used in the entity\u2019s public communications communicates to users of financial statements\nmanagement\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole.  \nB129 Examples of reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates an entity has a reason for using a\nsubtotal in its public communications other than to communicate to users of its financial statements\nmanagement\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole are that the subtotal:  \n(a) is required in a public communication by law or regulation;  \n(b) communicates performance related to financial statements prepared in accordance with an\naccounting framework other than Australian Accounting Standards;  \n(c) is used in a public communication to satisfy a request from an external party; or  \n(d) is used in a public communication for the purpose of communicating information other than\nfinancial performance.  \nB130 Paragraph 120 applies to a subtotal and not to individual items of income and expense that comprise the\nsubtotal. Accordingly, an entity cannot assert that a subtotal does not communicate management\u2019s view of an  \n-----  aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole based on information that demonstrates that an\nindividual item (or items) of income or expense within the subtotal does not represent such a view.  \nB131 An entity might change its use of a subtotal to communicate to users of its financial statements management\u2019s\nview of an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole. As a result a subtotal might become,\nor cease to be, a management-defined performance measure. Judgement is required to identify whether a\nmeasure not originally identified as a management-defined performance measure has become one, or whether\na measure previously identified as a management-defined performance measure has ceased to be one. For\nexample, an entity might be required by a regulator to report a particular subtotal that, when first used, does\nnot communicate management\u2019s view of an aspect of the financial performance of the entity as a whole. Over\ntime the process of producing the subtotal might lead to management using the measure internally to assess\nand monitor the entity\u2019s financial performance or expanding the commentary and explanations in public\ncommunications beyond the regulatory requirements, with the result that the measure meets the definition of\na management-defined performance measure.",

        "page_content=": "### Disclosure of management-defined performance measures\n_Single note for information about management-defined performance measures_  \nB132 Paragraph 122 requires an entity to include in a single note all information about management-defined\nperformance measures required by paragraphs 121\u2013125. If an entity also discloses other information in that\nnote, the information in the note shall be labelled in a way that clearly distinguishes the information required\nby paragraphs 121\u2013125 from the other information.  \nB133 For example, if an entity applies AASB 8 and the reportable segment information includes a managementdefined performance measure, the entity may disclose the required information about the management-defined\nperformance measure in the same note as other reportable segment information, provided the entity either:  \n(a) includes in that note the information required by paragraphs 121\u2013125 for all its management-defined\nperformance measures and, to fulfil the requirements in paragraph B132, labels the information in\nthe note in a way that clearly distinguishes the information required by paragraphs 121\u2013125 from\nthe information required by AASB 8; or  \n(b) provides a separate note that includes the information required for all its management-defined\nperformance measures, including those for which the entity includes information in the reportable\nsegment information.  \n_A clear and understandable manner_  \nB134 Paragraph 123 requires an entity to label and describe its management-defined performance measures in a\nclear and understandable manner that does not mislead users of financial statements. To provide such a\ndescription, an entity shall disclose information that enables a user of financial statements to understand the\nitems of income or expense included and excluded from the subtotal. Therefore, an entity shall:  \n(a) label and describe the measure in a way that faithfully represents its characteristics in accordance\nwith paragraph 43 (see paragraph B135); and  \n(b) provide information specific to management-defined performance measures \u2013 that is:  \n(i) if the entity has calculated the measure other than by using the accounting policies it used\nfor items in the statement(s) of financial performance, the entity shall state that fact and\nthe calculations it has used for the measure; and  \n(ii) if, in addition, the calculation of the measure differs from accounting policies required or\npermitted by Australian Accounting Standards, the entity shall state that additional fact\nand, if necessary, an explanation of the meaning of terms it uses (see paragraph B135(b)).  \nB135 To label and describe the measure in a way that faithfully represents its characteristics, an entity shall:  \n(a) label the measure in a way that represents the characteristics of the subtotal (for example, using the\nlabel \u2018operating profit before non-recurring expenses\u2019 only for a subtotal that excludes from\noperating profit all expenses identified by the entity as non-recurring); and  \n(b) explain the meaning of terms it uses in its descriptions that are necessary to understand the aspect\nof financial performance being communicated (for example, explaining how the entity defines \u2018nonrecurring expenses\u2019).  \n-----  _Reconciliation to the most directly comparable total or subtotal_  \nB136 Paragraph 123(c) requires an entity to reconcile each management-defined performance measure to the most\ndirectly comparable subtotal listed in paragraph 118 or total or subtotal specifically required to be presented\nor disclosed by Australian Accounting Standards. For example, an entity that discloses in the notes a\nmanagement-defined performance measure of adjusted operating profit or loss shall reconcile that measure to\noperating profit or loss. In aggregating or disaggregating the reconciling items disclosed, an entity shall apply\nthe requirements in paragraphs 41\u201343.  \nB137 For each reconciling item, an entity shall disclose:  \n(a) the amount(s) related to each line item in the statement(s) of financial performance; and  \n(b) a description of how the item is calculated and contributes to the management-defined performance\nmeasure providing useful information (see paragraphs B138\u2013B140), if necessary to provide the\ninformation required by paragraphs 123(a) and 123(b).  \nB138 The description required in paragraph B137(b) is required if there is more than one reconciling item and each\nitem is calculated using a different method or contributes to providing useful information in a different way.\nFor example, an entity might exclude from a management-defined performance measure several items of\nexpense, some because they were identified as outside management\u2019s control and others because they were\nidentified as non-recurring. In such cases, disclosure of which items contributed to which type of adjustment\nwould be required to explain how the management-defined performance measure provides useful information.  \nB139 A single explanation might apply to more than one item or might apply to all reconciling items collectively.\nFor example, an entity might exclude several items of income or expense in calculating a management-defined\nperformance measure based on an entity-specific application of \u2018non-recurring\u2019. In such a case, a single\nexplanation that includes the entity\u2019s definition of \u2018non-recurring\u2019 that applies to all reconciling items might\nsatisfy the requirement in paragraph B137(b).  \nB140 Applying paragraph 123(c), an entity is permitted to reconcile a management-defined performance measure\nto a total or subtotal that is not presented in the statement(s) of financial performance. In such cases, an entity:  \n(a) shall reconcile that total or subtotal to the most directly comparable total or subtotal presented in\nthe statement(s) of financial performance; and  \n(b) is not required to disclose the information required by paragraphs 123(d) and 123(e) for the\nreconciliation in (a).  \n_Income tax effect for each item disclosed in the reconciliation_  \nB141 An entity is required by paragraph 123(d) to disclose the income tax effect for each item disclosed in the\nreconciliation between a management-defined performance measure and the most directly comparable\nsubtotal listed in paragraph 118 or total or subtotal specifically required to be presented or disclosed by\nAustralian Accounting Standards. An entity shall determine the income tax effect required by paragraph\n123(d) by calculating the income tax effects of the underlying transaction(s):  \n(a) at the statutory tax rate(s) applicable to the transaction(s) in the tax jurisdiction(s) concerned;  \n(b) based on a reasonable pro rata allocation of the current and deferred tax of the entity in the tax\njurisdiction(s) concerned; or  \n(c) by using another method that achieves a more appropriate allocation in the circumstances.  \nB142 If, applying paragraph B141, an entity uses more than one method to calculate the income tax effects of\nreconciling items, it shall disclose how it determined the tax effects for each reconciling item.  \n-----  ",

Consequently, this assessment is not performed on the basis of scenarios\nthat the entity does not reasonably expect to occur, such as so-called \u2018worst case\u2019 or \u2018stress case\u2019 scenarios.\nFor example, if an entity expects that it will sell a particular portfolio of financial assets only in a stress case  \n-----  scenario, that scenario would not affect the entity\u2019s assessment of the business model for those assets if the\nentity reasonably expects that such a scenario will not occur. If cash flows are realised in a way that is different\nfrom the entity\u2019s expectations at the date that the entity assessed the business model (for example, if the entity\nsells more or fewer financial assets than it expected when it classified the assets), that does not give rise to a\nprior period error in the entity\u2019s financial statements (see AASB 108 _Basis of Preparation of Financial_\n_StatementsAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors) nor does it change the_\nclassification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model (ie those assets that the entity\nrecognised in prior periods and still holds) as long as the entity considered all relevant information that was\navailable at the time that it made the business model assessment.

However, there is no consensus on the classification of these cash flows for other entities.  \n-----  Interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as operating cash flows because they enter\ninto the determination of profit or loss. Alternatively, interest paid and interest and dividends received may be\nclassified as financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are costs of obtaining\nfinancial resources or returns on investments.  \n33A An entity shall classify dividends paid as cash flows from financing activities.  \n34 [Deleted]Dividends paid may be classified as a financing cash flow because they are a cost of obtaining\nfinancial resources. Alternatively, dividends paid may be classified as a component of cash flows from\noperating activities in order to assist users to determine the ability of an entity to pay dividends out of operating\ncash flows.  \n34A An entity, other than those entities described in paragraph 34B, shall classify:  \n(a) interest paid (as described in paragraph 32) as cash flows from financing activities.  \n(b) interest and dividends received as cash flows from investing activities.  \n34B An entity that invests in assets or provides financing to customers as a main business activity (as determined\napplying paragraphs B30\u2013B41 of AASB 18) shall determine how to classify dividends received, interest\nreceived and interest paid in the statement of cash flows by referring to how \u2013 applying AASB 18 \u2013 it classifies\ndividend income, interest income and interest expenses in the statement of profit or loss. An entity shall\nclassify the total of each of these cash flows in a single category in the statement of cash flows (that is, either\nas operating, investing or financing activities).  \n34C In applying paragraph 34B, if an entity classifies the total of each of dividend income, interest income and\ninterest expenses in a single category of the statement of profit or loss, the entity shall classify the total of each\nof dividends received, interest received and interest paid as cash flows arising from the associated activity in\nthe statement of cash flows. For example, if an entity classifies all its interest expenses in the financing\ncategory of the statement of profit or loss, the entity would classify all its interest paid as cash flows from\nfinancing activities.  \n34D In applying AASB 18, an entity may be required to classify each of dividend income, interest income and\ninterest expenses in more than one category of the statement of profit or loss. In such a case, in applying\nparagraph 34B the entity shall make an accounting policy choice to classify the related cash flows in one of\nthe associated activities in the statement of cash flows. For example, if an entity classifies interest expenses in\nthe operating category and the financing category of the statement of profit or loss, the entity would classify\nall its interest paid in accordance with its accounting policy as either cash flows from operating activities or\ncash flows from financing activities.",

        "page_content=": "### Disclosure\n_Disclosure of selection and application of accounting policies_  \n**27A** **An entity shall disclose material accounting policy information (see paragraph 5). Accounting policy**\n**information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity\u2019s**  \n-----  **financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of**\n**general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.**  \n27B Accounting policy information that relates to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions is immaterial\nand need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may nevertheless be material because of the nature\nof the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all\naccounting policy information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material.  \n27C Accounting policy information is expected to be material if users of an entity\u2019s financial statements would\nneed it to understand other material information in the financial statements. For example, an entity is likely to\nconsider accounting policy information material to its financial statements if that information relates to\nmaterial transactions, other events or conditions and:  \n(a) the entity changed its accounting policy during the reporting period and this change resulted in a\nmaterial change to the information in the financial statements;  \n(b) the entity chose the accounting policy from one or more options permitted by Australian Accounting\nStandards \u2013 such a situation could arise if the entity chose to measure investment property at\nhistorical cost rather than fair value;  \n(c) the accounting policy was developed in accordance with this Standard in the absence of an\nAustralian Accounting Standard that specifically applies;  \n(d) the accounting policy relates to an area for which an entity is required to make significant\njudgements or assumptions in applying an accounting policy, and the entity discloses those\njudgements or assumptions in accordance with paragraphs 27G and 31A; or  \n(e) the accounting required for them is complex and users of the entity\u2019s financial statements would\notherwise not understand those material transactions, other events or conditions \u2013 such a situation\ncould arise if an entity applies more than one Standard to a class of material transactions.  \n27D Accounting policy information that focuses on how an entity has applied the requirements in the Australian\nAccounting Standards to its own circumstances provides entity-specific information that is more useful to\nusers of financial statements than standardised information, or information that only duplicates or summarises\nthe requirements of the Standards.  \n27E If an entity discloses immaterial accounting policy information, such information shall not obscure material\naccounting policy information.  \n27F An entity\u2019s conclusion that accounting policy information is immaterial does not affect the related disclosure\nrequirements set out in other Australian Accounting Standards.  \n**27G** **An entity shall disclose, along with its material accounting policy information or other notes, the**\n**judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see paragraph 31A), that management has made**\n**in the process of applying the entity\u2019s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on**\n**the amounts recognised in the financial statements.**  \n27H In the process of applying the entity\u2019s accounting policies, management makes various judgements, apart from\nthose involving estimations, that can significantly affect the amounts it recognises in the financial statements.\nFor example, management makes judgements in determining:  \n(a) when substantially all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of financial assets and, for\nlessors, assets subject to leases are transferred to other entities;  \n(b) whether, in substance, particular sales of goods are financing arrangements and therefore do not\ngive rise to revenue; and  \n(c) whether the contractual terms of a financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.  \n27I Some of the disclosures made in accordance with paragraph 27G are required by other Australian Accounting\nStandards. For example, AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities requires an entity to disclose the\njudgements it has made in determining whether it controls another entity. AASB 140 Investment Property\nrequires disclosure of the criteria developed by the entity to distinguish investment property from owneroccupied property and from property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, when classification of\nthe property is difficult.  \n_Disclosure of changes in accounting policies_  \n**28** **When initial application of an Australian Accounting Standard has an effect on the current period or**\n**any prior period, would have such an effect except that it is impracticable to determine the amount of**\n**the adjustment, or might have an effect on future periods, an entity shall disclose:**  \n-----  ...  \n_Disclosure of sources of estimation uncertainty_  \n**31A** **An entity shall disclose information about the assumptions it makes about the future, and other major**\n**sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of**\n**resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next**\n**financial year. In respect of those assets and liabilities, the notes shall include details of:**  \n**(a)** **their nature; and**  \n**(b)** **their carrying amount as at the end of the reporting period.**  \n31B Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of uncertain\nfuture events on those assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. For example, in the absence of\nrecently observed market prices, future-oriented estimates are necessary to measure the recoverable amount\nof classes of property, plant and equipment, the effect of technological obsolescence on inventories, provisions\nsubject to the future outcome of litigation in progress, and long-term employee benefit liabilities such as\npension obligations. These estimates involve assumptions about such items as the risk adjustment to cash\nflows or discount rates, future changes in salaries and future changes in prices affecting other costs.  \n31C The assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty disclosed in accordance with paragraph 31A\nrelate to the estimates that require management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the\nnumber of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increases,\nthose judgements become more subjective and complex, and the potential for a consequential material\nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities normally increases accordingly.  \n31D The disclosures in paragraph 31A are not required for assets and liabilities with a significant risk that their\ncarrying amounts might change materially within the next financial year if, at the end of the reporting period,\nthey are measured at fair value based on a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability.\nSuch fair values might change materially within the next financial year but these changes would not arise from\nassumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period.  \n31E An entity provides the disclosures in paragraph 31A in a manner that helps users of financial statements to\nunderstand the judgements that management makes about the future and about other sources of estimation\nuncertainty. The nature and extent of the information provided vary according to the nature of the assumption\nand other circumstances. Examples of the types of disclosures an entity makes are:  \n(a) the nature of the assumption or other estimation uncertainty;  \n(b) the sensitivity of carrying amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying their\ncalculation, including the reasons for the sensitivity;  \n(c) the expected resolution of an uncertainty and the range of reasonably possible outcomes within the\nnext financial year in respect of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities affected; and  \n(d) an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning those assets and liabilities, if the\nuncertainty remains unresolved.  \n31F This Standard does not require an entity to disclose budget information or forecasts in making the disclosures\nin paragraph 31A.  \n31G Sometimes it is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of an assumption or another source\nof estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period. In such cases, the entity discloses that it is\nreasonably possible, on the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that are\ndifferent from the assumption could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or\nliability affected. In all cases, the entity discloses the nature and carrying amount of the specific asset or\nliability (or class of assets or liabilities) affected by the assumption.  \n31H The disclosures in paragraph 27G of particular judgements that management made in the process of applying\nthe entity\u2019s accounting policies do not relate to the disclosures of sources of estimation uncertainty in\nparagraph 31A.  \n31I Other Australian Accounting Standards require the disclosure of some of the assumptions that would otherwise\nbe required in accordance with paragraph 31A. For example, AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities\n_and Contingent Assets requires disclosure, in specified circumstances, of major assumptions concerning future_\nevents affecting classes of provisions. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of significant\nassumptions (including the valuation technique(s) and inputs) the entity uses when measuring the fair values\nof assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value.  \n-----  ",

In the not-for-profit public sector, many entities are likely to\nengage frequently with persons who are a related party of that entity in the course of delivering the entity\u2019s\npublic service objectives, including the raising of funds (for example, rates and taxes) to meet those objectives.\nThese related party transactions often occur on terms and conditions no different to those applying to the\ngeneral public (for example, the Medicare rebate or public school fees). A not-for-profit public sector entity\nmay determine that information about related party transactions occurring during the course of delivering its\npublic service objectives and which occur on no different terms to that of the general public is not material for\ndisclosure in its general purpose financial statements and accordingly need not be disclosed.

When a subsidiary in a group\nissues a financial instrument and a parent or other group entity agrees additional terms directly with the holders\nof the instrument (eg a guarantee), the group may not have discretion over distributions or redemption.\nAlthough the subsidiary may appropriately classify the instrument without regard to these additional terms in\nits individual financial statements, the effect of other agreements between members of the group and the\nholders of the instrument is considered in order to ensure that consolidated financial statements reflect the\ncontracts and transactions entered into by the group as a whole.

In these cases, the legislation provides that the related GST is\napportioned between input-taxed and other activities in measuring the recognised amount of the acquisition\ncost. In some cases, periodic adjustments will need to be made in respect of the apportionment. Where the\nrelated item is a depreciable asset, consequential adjustments will need to be made to reflect revisions of the\nacquisition cost and carrying amount of the asset. These adjustments are in the nature of revisions of the\ndepreciable amount and would be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of AASB 108 Basis of\n_Preparation of Financial StatementsAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._  \n-----  ",

For example, an entity\u2019s total\nassets, total liabilities, total equity, total income, total expenses and total cash flows provide some information\nabout the entity\u2019s financial position, financial performance and cash flows, but are too aggregated to be useful\non their own. Conversely, disaggregated information about individual transactions or other events provides\ndetailed information, but may be so detailed as to obscure material information. Accordingly, an entity uses\nits judgement to determine how much detail is necessary to provide useful information.  \nParagraph 30A was added to IAS 1 to highlight that when an entity decides how it aggregates information in\nthe financial statements, it should take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances. Paragraph 30A\nemphasises that an entity should not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by providing\nimmaterial information that obscures the material information in financial statements or by aggregating\nmaterial items that have different natures or functions. Obscuring material information with immaterial\ninformation in financial statements makes the material information less visible and therefore makes the\nfinancial statements less understandable.

For example, an entity\u2019s total\nassets, total liabilities, total equity, total income, total expenses and total cash flows provide some information\nabout the entity\u2019s financial position, financial performance and cash flows, but are too aggregated to be useful\non their own. Conversely, disaggregated information about individual transactions or other events provides\ndetailed information, but may be so detailed as to obscure material information. Accordingly, an entity uses\nits judgement to determine how much detail is necessary to provide useful information.  \nParagraph 30A was added to IAS 1 to highlight that when an entity decides how it aggregates information in\nthe financial statements, it should take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances. Paragraph 30A\nemphasises that an entity should not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by providing\nimmaterial information that obscures the material information in financial statements or by aggregating\nmaterial items that have different natures or functions. Obscuring material information with immaterial\ninformation in financial statements makes the material information less visible and therefore makes the\nfinancial statements less understandable. The amendments do not actually prohibit entities from disclosing\nimmaterial information, because the Board thinks that such a requirement would not be operational; however,\nthe amendments emphasise that disclosure should not result in material information being obscured.",

Based on outreach conducted by the AASB among Australian stakeholders across a range of sectors\nusing Exposure Draft ED 298 General Presentation and Disclosures (January 2020), the Board is aware that\nmany, but potentially not all, aspects of IFRS 18 are suitable for application by all types of Australian entities\npreparing Tier 1 GPFS.  \nBC5 The AASB noted that, while not all the proposals in ED 298 have been retained in IFRS 18 and more guidance\nhas been provided on some matters, a number of concerns raised by entities that are not publicly accountable\nfor-profit private sector entities (such as not-for-profit private and public sector entities) may remain.  \nBC6 Based on the feedback received on ED 298 and the changes made by the IASB in finalising IFRS 18, and the\npost-implementation review of AASB 1056 _Superannuation Entities, the AASB has been able to give_\npreliminary consideration to the suitability of IFRS 18 for all types of entities preparing Tier 1 GPFS. The\nAASB decided to:  \n(a) make AASB 18 applicable to for-profit entities preparing Tier 1 GPFS, other than superannuation\nentities, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027;  \n(b) make AASB 18 applicable to not-for-profit private sector entities, not-for-profit public sector\nentities and superannuation entities preparing Tier 1 GPFS for annual periods beginning on or after\n1 January 2028 and to commence, as soon as feasible, further outreach with stakeholders on\napplying AASB 18 to these entities; and  \n(c) depending on the outcomes of the outreach, consider making modifications to AASB 18 for\napplication by not-for-profit private sector entities, not-for-profit public sector entities and\nsuperannuation entities.  \nBC7 The AASB expects that any modifications to AASB 18 for application by entities noted in paragraph BC6(c)\ncould take the form of guidance, exemptions and alternative requirements.",
