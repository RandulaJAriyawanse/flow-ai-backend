In particular, this Standard requires:  \n(a) limited improvements to accounting by insurers for insurance contracts.  \n(b) disclosure that identifies and explains the amounts in an insurer\u2019s financial statements arising\nfrom insurance contracts and helps users of those financial statements understand the amount,\ntiming and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts.",

AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 address all aspects of recognition, measurement and\ndisclosure of general insurance contracts and life insurance contracts. The requirements of those\nStandards address a wider range of accounting requirements than this Standard, but enable\nsimultaneous compliance with this Standard.  \n-----  4 An entity shall not apply this Standard to:  \n(a) product warranties issued directly by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer (see AASB 15 _Revenue_\n_from Contracts with Customers and AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent_\n_Assets)._  \n(b) employers\u2019 assets and liabilities under employee benefit plans (see AASB 119 Employee Benefits\nand AASB 2 _Share-based Payment) and retirement benefit obligations reported by defined_\nbenefit retirement plans (see AASB 1056 Superannuation Entities).  \n(c) contractual rights or contractual obligations that are contingent on the future use of, or right to\nuse, a non-financial item (for example, some licence fees, royalties, variable lease payments and\nsimilar items), as well as a lessee\u2019s residual value guarantee embedded in a lease (see AASB 16\n_Leases, AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and AASB 138 Intangible Assets)._  \n(d) financial guarantee contracts unless the issuer has previously asserted explicitly that it regards\nsuch contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts,\nin which case the issuer may elect to apply either AASB 132, AASB 7 and AASB 9 or\nAASB 1023 to such financial guarantee contracts. The issuer may make that election contract by\ncontract, but the election for each contract is irrevocable.  \n(e) contingent consideration payable or receivable in a business combination (see AASB 3 Business\n_Combinations)._  \n(f) _direct insurance contracts that the entity holds (ie direct insurance contracts in which the entity is_\nthe _policyholder). However, a_ _cedant shall apply this Standard to reinsurance contracts that it_\nholds.  \n5 For ease of reference, this Standard describes any entity that issues an insurance contract as an insurer,\nwhether or not the issuer is regarded as an insurer for legal or supervisory purposes. All references in\nparagraphs 3(a)\u20133(b), 20A\u201320Q, 35B\u201335N, 39B\u201339M and 46\u201349 to an insurer shall be read as also\nreferring to an issuer of a financial instrument that contains a discretionary participation feature.  \n6 A reinsurance contract is a type of insurance contract. Accordingly, all references in this Standard to\ninsurance contracts also apply to reinsurance contracts.  \nAus6.1 This Standard applies to fixed-fee service contracts, described in paragraphs B6 and B7, which\nmeet the definition of an insurance contract under this Standard.",

Furthermore, those requirements also apply if the holder\u2019s ability to exercise a put\noption or cash surrender option is triggered by a change in such a variable (for example, a put option that\ncan be exercised if a stock market index reaches a specified level).  \n9 Paragraph 8 applies equally to options to surrender a financial instrument containing a discretionary\nparticipation feature.",

In some cases, an\ninsurer is required or permitted to unbundle those components:  \n(a) unbundling is required if both the following conditions are met:  \n(i) the insurer can measure the deposit component (including any embedded surrender\noptions) separately (ie without considering the insurance component).  \n(ii) the insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not otherwise require it to recognise all obligations\nand rights arising from the deposit component.  \n-----  (b) unbundling is permitted, but not required, if the insurer can measure the deposit component\nseparately as in (a)(i) but its accounting policies require it to recognise all obligations and rights\narising from the deposit component, regardless of the basis used to measure those rights and\nobligations.  \n(c) unbundling is prohibited if an insurer cannot measure the deposit component separately as in\n(a)(i).  \n11 The following is an example of a case when an insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not require it to recognise\nall obligations arising from a deposit component. A cedant receives compensation for losses from a\n_reinsurer, but the contract obliges the cedant to repay the compensation in future years. That obligation_\narises from a deposit component. If the cedant\u2019s accounting policies would otherwise permit it to recognise\nthe compensation as income without recognising the resulting obligation, unbundling is required.  \n12 To unbundle a contract, an insurer shall:  \n(a) apply this Standard to the insurance component.  \n(b) apply AASB 9 to the deposit component.",

If that**\n**assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities (less related deferred**\n**acquisition costs and related intangible assets, such as those discussed in paragraphs 31 and 32) is**\n**inadequate in the light of the estimated future cash flows, the entire deficiency shall be recognised in**\n**profit or loss.**  \n16 If an insurer applies a liability adequacy test that meets specified minimum requirements, this Standard\nimposes no further requirements. The minimum requirements are the following:  \n(a) The test considers current estimates of all contractual cash flows, and of related cash flows such\nas claims handling costs, as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees.  \n-----  (b) If the test shows that the liability is inadequate, the entire deficiency is recognised in profit or\nloss.  \n17 If an insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not require a liability adequacy test that meets the minimum\nrequirements of paragraph 16, the insurer shall:  \n(a) determine the carrying amount of the relevant insurance liabilities[1] less the carrying amount of:  \n(i) any related deferred acquisition costs; and  \n(ii) any related intangible assets, such as those acquired in a business combination or\nportfolio transfer (see paragraphs 31 and 32).

If it is less, the\ninsurer shall recognise the entire difference in profit or loss and decrease the carrying amount of\nthe related deferred acquisition costs or related intangible assets or increase the carrying amount\nof the relevant insurance liabilities.  \n18 If an insurer\u2019s liability adequacy test meets the minimum requirements of paragraph 16, the test is applied at\nthe level of aggregation specified in that test. If its liability adequacy test does not meet those minimum\nrequirements, the comparison described in paragraph 17 shall be made at the level of a portfolio of contracts\nthat are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a single portfolio.  \n19 The amount described in paragraph 17(b) (ie the result of applying AASB 137) shall reflect future\ninvestment margins (see paragraphs 27\u201329) if, and only if, the amount described in paragraph 17(a) also\nreflects those margins.",

If an\ninsurer elects to apply those requirements, it shall apply the relevant transition provisions in AASB 9,\ndisclose the fact that it has applied those requirements and provide on an ongoing basis the related\ndisclosures set out in paragraphs 10\u201311 of AASB 7 (as amended by AASB 9 (2010)).  \n20D An insurer\u2019s activities are predominantly connected with insurance if, and only if:  \n(a) the carrying amount of its liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of this Standard,\nAASB 1023 and AASB 1038, which includes any deposit components or embedded derivatives\nunbundled from insurance contracts applying paragraphs 7\u201312 of this Standard, is significant\ncompared to the total carrying amount of all its liabilities; and  \n(b) the percentage of the total carrying amount of its liabilities connected with insurance (see\nparagraph 20E) relative to the total carrying amount of all its liabilities is:  \n(i) greater than 90 per cent; or  \n(ii) less than or equal to 90 per cent but greater than 80 per cent, and the insurer does not\nengage in a significant activity unconnected with insurance (see paragraph 20F).  \n20E For the purposes of applying paragraph 20D(b), liabilities connected with insurance comprise:  \n(a) liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of this Standard, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038,\nas described in paragraph 20D(a);  \n(b) non-derivative investment contract liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\napplying AASB 139 (including those designated as at fair value through profit or loss to which\nthe insurer has applied the requirements in AASB 9 for the presentation of gains and losses (see\nparagraphs 20B(a) and 20C)); and  \n(c) liabilities that arise because the insurer issues, or fulfils obligations arising from, the contracts in\n(a) and (b). Examples of such liabilities include derivatives used to mitigate risks arising from\nthose contracts and from the assets backing those contracts, relevant tax liabilities such as the\ndeferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences on liabilities arising from those contracts,\nand debt instruments issued that are included in the insurer\u2019s regulatory capital.  \n20F In assessing whether it engages in a significant activity unconnected with insurance for the purposes of\napplying paragraph 20D(b)(ii), an insurer shall consider:  \n(a) only those activities from which it may earn income and incur expenses; and  \n(b) quantitative or qualitative factors (or both), including publicly available information such as the\nindustry classification that users of financial statements apply to the insurer.  \n20G Paragraph 20B(b) requires an entity to assess whether it qualifies for the temporary exemption from\nAASB 9 at its annual reporting date that immediately precedes 1 April 2016. After that date:  \n(a) an entity that previously qualified for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 shall reassess\nwhether its activities are predominantly connected with insurance at a subsequent annual\nreporting date if, and only if, there was a change in the entity\u2019s activities, as described in\nparagraphs 20H\u201320I, during the annual period that ended on that date.  \n(b) an entity that previously did not qualify for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 is permitted\nto reassess whether its activities are predominantly connected with insurance at a subsequent\nannual reporting date before 31 December 2018 if, and only if, there was a change in the entity\u2019s\nactivities, as described in paragraphs 20H\u201320I, during the annual period that ended on that date.  \n20H For the purposes of applying paragraph 20G, a change in an entity\u2019s activities is a change that:  \n(a) is determined by the entity\u2019s senior management as a result of external or internal changes;  \n(b) is significant to the entity\u2019s operations; and  \n(c) is demonstrable to external parties.  \nAccordingly, such a change occurs only when the entity begins or ceases to perform an activity that is\nsignificant to its operations or significantly changes the magnitude of one of its activities; for example,\nwhen the entity has acquired, disposed of or terminated a business line.  \n20I A change in an entity\u2019s activities, as described in paragraph 20H, is expected to be very infrequent. The\nfollowing are not changes in an entity\u2019s activities for the purposes of applying paragraph 20G:  \n-----  (a) a change in the entity\u2019s funding structure that in itself does not affect the activities from which the\nentity earns income and incurs expenses.  \n(b) the entity\u2019s plan to sell a business line, even if the assets and liabilities are classified as held for\nsale applying AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. A plan to\nsell a business line could change the entity\u2019s activities and give rise to a reassessment in the\nfuture but has yet to affect the liabilities recognised on its statement of financial position.  \n20J If an entity no longer qualifies for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 as a result of a reassessment (see\nparagraph 20G(a)), then the entity is permitted to continue to apply the temporary exemption from AASB 9\nonly until the end of the annual period that began immediately after that reassessment. Nevertheless, the\nentity must apply AASB 9 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. For example, if an\nentity determines that it no longer qualifies for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 applying paragraph\n20G(a) on 31 December 2018 (the end of its annual period), then the entity is permitted to continue to apply\nthe temporary exemption from AASB 9 only until 31 December 2019.  \n20K An insurer that previously elected to apply the temporary exemption from AASB 9 may at the beginning of\nany subsequent annual period irrevocably elect to apply AASB 9.",

However, there is a rebuttable presumption that an insurer\u2019s financial statements will become less\nrelevant and reliable if it introduces an accounting policy that reflects future investment margins in the\nmeasurement of insurance contracts, unless those margins affect the contractual payments. Two examples\nof accounting policies that reflect those margins are:  \n(a) using a discount rate that reflects the estimated return on the insurer\u2019s assets; or  \n(b) projecting the returns on those assets at an estimated rate of return, discounting those projected\nreturns at a different rate and including the result in the measurement of the liability.  \n28 An insurer may overcome the rebuttable presumption described in paragraph 27 if, and only if, the other\ncomponents of a change in accounting policies increase the relevance and reliability of its financial\nstatements sufficiently to outweigh the decrease in relevance and reliability caused by the inclusion of\nfuture investment margins. For example, suppose that an insurer\u2019s existing accounting policies for insurance\ncontracts involve excessively prudent assumptions set at inception and a discount rate prescribed by a\nregulator without direct reference to market conditions, and ignore some embedded options and guarantees.\nThe insurer might make its financial statements more relevant and no less reliable by switching to a\ncomprehensive investor-oriented basis of accounting that is widely used and involves:  \n(a) current estimates and assumptions;  \n(b) a reasonable (but not excessively prudent) adjustment to reflect risk and uncertainty;  \n(c) measurements that reflect both the intrinsic value and time value of embedded options and\nguarantees; and  \n(d) a current market discount rate, even if that discount rate reflects the estimated return on the\ninsurer\u2019s assets.  \n29 In some measurement approaches, the discount rate is used to determine the present value of a future profit\nmargin. That profit margin is then attributed to different periods using a formula. In those approaches, the\ndiscount rate affects the measurement of the liability only indirectly. In particular, the use of a less\nappropriate discount rate has a limited or no effect on the measurement of the liability at inception.\nHowever, in other approaches, the discount rate determines the measurement of the liability directly. In the\nlatter case, because the introduction of an asset-based discount rate has a more significant effect, it is highly\nunlikely that an insurer could overcome the rebuttable presumption described in paragraph 27.",

In other insurance\ncontracts, the insured event is an event that occurs during the term of the contract, even if the resulting loss\nis discovered after the end of the contract term.  \nB4 Some insurance contracts cover events that have already occurred, but whose financial effect is still\nuncertain. An example is a reinsurance contract that covers the direct insurer against adverse development\nof claims already reported by policyholders.

        "page_content=": "## Payments in kind  \nB5 Some insurance contracts require or permit payments to be made in kind. An example is when the insurer\nreplaces a stolen article directly, instead of reimbursing the policyholder. Another example is when an\ninsurer uses its own hospitals and medical staff to provide medical services covered by the contracts.  \nB6 Some fixed-fee service contracts in which the level of service depends on an uncertain event meet the\ndefinition of an insurance contract in this Standard but are not regulated as insurance contracts in some\ncountries. One example is a maintenance contract in which the service provider agrees to repair specified\nequipment after a malfunction. The fixed service fee is based on the expected number of malfunctions, but\nit is uncertain whether a particular machine will break down. The malfunction of the equipment adversely\naffects its owner and the contract compensates the owner (in kind, rather than cash). Another example is a\ncontract for car breakdown services in which the provider agrees, for a fixed annual fee, to provide roadside\nassistance or tow the car to a nearby garage. The latter contract could meet the definition of an insurance\ncontract even if the provider does not agree to carry out repairs or replace parts.  \nB7 Applying the Standard to the contracts described in paragraph B6 is likely to be no more burdensome than\napplying the Australian Accounting Standards that would be applicable if such contracts were outside the\nscope of this Standard:  \n(a) There are unlikely to be material liabilities for malfunctions and breakdowns that have already\noccurred.  \n(b) If AASB 15 applied, the service provider would recognise revenue when (or as) it transfers\nservices to the customer (subject to other specified criteria). That approach is also acceptable\nunder this Standard, which permits the service provider (i) to continue its existing accounting\npolicies for these contracts unless they involve practices prohibited by paragraph 14 and (ii) to\nimprove its accounting policies if so permitted by paragraphs 22\u201330.  \n-----  (c) The service provider considers whether the cost of meeting its contractual obligation to provide\nservices exceeds the revenue received in advance. To do this, it applies the liability adequacy test\ndescribed in paragraphs 15\u201319 of this Standard. If this Standard did not apply to these contracts,\nthe service provider would apply AASB 137 to determine whether the contracts are onerous.  \n(d) For these contracts, the disclosure requirements in this Standard are unlikely to add significantly\nto disclosures required by other Australian Accounting Standards.",

        "page_content=": "## Distinction between insurance risk and other risks  \nB8 The definition of an insurance contract refers to insurance risk, which this Standard defines as risk, other\nthan financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the issuer. A contract that exposes the issuer\nto financial risk without significant insurance risk is not an insurance contract.  \nB9 The definition of financial risk in Appendix A includes a list of financial and non-financial variables. That\nlist includes non-financial variables that are not specific to a party to the contract, such as an index of\nearthquake losses in a particular region or an index of temperatures in a particular city. It excludes nonfinancial variables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a\nfire that damages or destroys an asset of that party. Furthermore, the risk of changes in the fair value of a\nnon-financial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects not only changes in market prices for such\nassets (a financial variable) but also the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a party to a\ncontract (a non-financial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car\nexposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car\u2019s physical condition, that risk is insurance risk, not\nfinancial risk.  \nB10 Some contracts expose the issuer to financial risk, in addition to significant insurance risk. For example,\nmany life insurance contracts both guarantee a minimum rate of return to policyholders (creating financial\nrisk) and promise death benefits that at some times significantly exceed the policyholder\u2019s account balance\n(creating insurance risk in the form of mortality risk). Such contracts are insurance contracts.  \nB11 Under some contracts, an insured event triggers the payment of an amount linked to a price index. Such\ncontracts are insurance contracts, provided the payment that is contingent on the insured event can be\nsignificant. For example, a life-contingent annuity linked to a cost-of-living index transfers insurance risk\nbecause payment is triggered by an uncertain event\u2014the survival of the annuitant. The link to the price\nindex is an embedded derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk. If the resulting transfer of insurance\nrisk is significant, the embedded derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract, in which case it\nneed not be separated and measured at fair value (see paragraph 7 of this Standard).  \nB12 The definition of insurance risk refers to risk that the insurer accepts from the policyholder. In other words,\ninsurance risk is a pre-existing risk transferred from the policyholder to the insurer. Thus, a new risk created\nby the contract is not insurance risk.  \nB13 The definition of an insurance contract refers to an adverse effect on the policyholder. The definition does\nnot limit the payment by the insurer to an amount equal to the financial impact of the adverse event. For\nexample, the definition does not exclude \u2018new-for-old\u2019 coverage that pays the policyholder sufficient to\npermit replacement of a damaged old asset by a new asset. Similarly, the definition does not limit payment\nunder a term life insurance contract to the financial loss suffered by the deceased\u2019s dependants, nor does it\npreclude the payment of predetermined amounts to quantify the loss caused by death or an accident.  \nB14 Some contracts require a payment if a specified uncertain event occurs, but do not require an adverse effect\non the policyholder as a precondition for payment. Such a contract is not an insurance contract even if the\nholder uses the contract to mitigate an underlying risk exposure. For example, if the holder uses a derivative\nto hedge an underlying non-financial variable that is correlated with cash flows from an asset of the entity,\nthe derivative is not an insurance contract because payment is not conditional on whether the holder is\nadversely affected by a reduction in the cash flows from the asset. Conversely, the definition of an\ninsurance contract refers to an uncertain event for which an adverse effect on the policyholder is a\ncontractual precondition for payment. This contractual precondition does not require the insurer to\ninvestigate whether the event actually caused an adverse effect, but permits the insurer to deny payment if it\nis not satisfied that the event caused an adverse effect.  \nB15 Lapse or persistency risk (ie the risk that the counterparty will cancel the contract earlier or later than the\nissuer had expected in pricing the contract) is not insurance risk because the payment to the counterparty is\nnot contingent on an uncertain future event that adversely affects the counterparty. Similarly, expense risk\n(ie the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract,\nrather than in costs associated with insured events) is not insurance risk because an unexpected increase in\nexpenses does not adversely affect the counterparty.  \n-----  B16 Therefore, a contract that exposes the issuer to lapse risk, persistency risk or expense risk is not an\ninsurance contract unless it also exposes the issuer to insurance risk. However, if the issuer of that contract\nmitigates that risk by using a second contract to transfer part of that risk to another party, the second\ncontract exposes that other party to insurance risk.  \nB17 An insurer can accept significant insurance risk from the policyholder only if the insurer is an entity\nseparate from the policyholder. In the case of a mutual insurer, the mutual accepts risk from each\npolicyholder and pools that risk. Although policyholders bear that pooled risk collectively in their capacity\nas owners, the mutual has still accepted the risk that is the essence of an insurance contract.",

        "page_content=": "## Examples of insurance contracts  \nB18 The following are examples of contracts that are insurance contracts, if the transfer of insurance risk is\nsignificant:  \n(a) insurance against theft or damage to property.  \n(b) insurance against product liability, professional liability, civil liability or legal expenses.  \n(c) life insurance and prepaid funeral plans (although death is certain, it is uncertain when death will\noccur or, for some types of life insurance, whether death will occur within the period covered by\nthe insurance).  \n(d) life-contingent annuities and pensions (ie contracts that provide compensation for the uncertain\nfuture event\u2014the survival of the annuitant or pensioner\u2014to assist the annuitant or pensioner in\nmaintaining a given standard of living, which would otherwise be adversely affected by his or her\nsurvival).  \n(e) disability and medical cover.  \n(f) surety bonds, fidelity bonds, performance bonds and bid bonds (ie contracts that provide\ncompensation if another party fails to perform a contractual obligation, for example an obligation\nto construct a building).  \n(g) credit insurance that provides for specified payments to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss\nit incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or\nmodified terms of a debt instrument. These contracts could have various legal forms, such as that\nof a guarantee, some types of letter of credit, a credit derivative default contract or an insurance\ncontract. However, although these contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract, they also\nmeet the definition of a financial guarantee contract in AASB 9 and are within the scope of\nAASB 132[4] and AASB 9, not this Standard (see paragraph 4(d)). Nevertheless, if an issuer of\nfinancial guarantee contracts has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such contracts as\ninsurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts, the issuer may\nelect to apply either AASB 132[5] and AASB 9 or AASB 1023 to such financial guarantee\ncontracts.  \n(h) product warranties. Product warranties issued by another party for goods sold by a manufacturer,\ndealer or retailer are within the scope of this Standard. However, product warranties issued\ndirectly by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer are outside its scope, because they are within the\nscope of AASB 15 and AASB 137.  \n(i) title insurance (ie insurance against the discovery of defects in title to land that were not apparent\nwhen the insurance contract was written). In this case, the insured event is the discovery of a\ndefect in the title, not the defect itself.  \n(j) travel assistance (ie compensation in cash or in kind to policyholders for losses suffered while\nthey are travelling). Paragraphs B6 and B7 discuss some contracts of this kind.  \n(k) catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both if a specified\nevent adversely affects the issuer of the bond (unless the specified event does not create\nsignificant insurance risk, for example if the event is a change in an interest rate or foreign\nexchange rate).  \n(l) insurance swaps and other contracts that require a payment based on changes in climatic,\ngeological or other physical variables that are specific to a party to the contract.  \n(m) reinsurance contracts.  \n4 When an entity applies AASB 7, the reference to AASB 132 is replaced by a reference to AASB 7.  \n5 When an entity applies AASB 7, the reference to AASB 132 is replaced by a reference to AASB 7.  \n-----  B19 The following are examples of items that are not insurance contracts:  \n(a) investment contracts that have the legal form of an insurance contract but do not expose the\ninsurer to significant insurance risk, for example life insurance contracts in which the insurer\nbears no significant mortality risk (such contracts are non-insurance financial instruments or\nservice contracts, see paragraphs B20 and B21).  \n(b) contracts that have the legal form of insurance, but pass all significant insurance risk back to the\npolicyholder through non-cancellable and enforceable mechanisms that adjust future payments by\nthe policyholder as a direct result of insured losses, for example some financial reinsurance\ncontracts or some group contracts (such contracts are normally non-insurance financial\ninstruments or service contracts, see paragraphs B20 and B21).  \n(c) self-insurance, in other words retaining a risk that could have been covered by insurance (there is\nno insurance contract because there is no agreement with another party).  \n(d) contracts (such as gambling contracts) that require a payment if a specified uncertain future event\noccurs, but do not require, as a contractual precondition for payment, that the event adversely\naffects the policyholder. However, this does not preclude the specification of a predetermined\npayout to quantify the loss caused by a specified event such as death or an accident (see also\nparagraph B13).  \n(e) derivatives that expose one party to financial risk but not insurance risk, because they require that\nparty to make payment based solely on changes in one or more of a specified interest rate,\nfinancial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit\nrating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the\nvariable is not specific to a party to the contract (see AASB 9).  \n(f) a credit-related guarantee (or letter of credit, credit derivative default contract or credit insurance\ncontract) that requires payments even if the holder has not incurred a loss on the failure of the\ndebtor to make payments when due (see AASB 9).  \n(g) contracts that require a payment based on a climatic, geological or other physical variable that is\nnot specific to a party to the contract (commonly described as weather derivatives).  \n(h) catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, based on a\nclimatic, geological or other physical variable that is not specific to a party to the contract.  \nB20 If the contracts described in paragraph B19 create financial assets or financial liabilities, they are within the\nscope of AASB 9. Among other things, this means that the parties to the contract use what is sometimes\ncalled deposit accounting, which involves the following:  \n(a) one party recognises the consideration received as a financial liability, rather than as revenue.  \n(b) the other party recognises the consideration paid as a financial asset, rather than as an expense.  \nB21 If the contracts described in paragraph B19 do not create financial assets or financial liabilities, AASB 15\napplies. Under AASB 15, revenue is recognised when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation by\ntransferring a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which\nthe entity expects to be entitled.",

        "page_content=": "## Significant insurance risk  \nB22 A contract is an insurance contract only if it transfers significant insurance risk. Paragraphs B8\u2013B21 discuss\ninsurance risk. The following paragraphs discuss the assessment of whether insurance risk is significant.  \nB23 Insurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant\nadditional benefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance (ie have no\ndiscernible effect on the economics of the transaction). If significant additional benefits would be payable in\nscenarios that have commercial substance, the condition in the previous sentence may be met even if the\ninsured event is extremely unlikely or even if the expected (ie probability-weighted) present value of\ncontingent cash flows is a small proportion of the expected present value of all the remaining contractual\ncash flows.  \nB24 The additional benefits described in paragraph B23 refer to amounts that exceed those that would be\npayable if no insured event occurred (excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance). Those additional\namounts include claims handling and claims assessment costs, but exclude:  \n(a) the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future services. For example, in an\ninvestment-linked life insurance contract, the death of the policyholder means that the insurer can\nno longer perform investment management services and collect a fee for doing so. However, this  \n-----  economic loss for the insurer does not reflect insurance risk, just as a mutual fund manager does\nnot take on insurance risk in relation to the possible death of the client. Therefore, the potential\nloss of future investment management fees is not relevant in assessing how much insurance risk is\ntransferred by a contract.  \n(b) waiver on death of charges that would be made on cancellation or surrender. Because the contract\nbrought those charges into existence, the waiver of these charges does not compensate the\npolicyholder for a pre-existing risk. Hence, they are not relevant in assessing how much insurance\nrisk is transferred by a contract.  \n(c) a payment conditional on an event that does not cause a significant loss to the holder of the\ncontract. For example, consider a contract that requires the issuer to pay one million currency\nunits if an asset suffers physical damage causing an insignificant economic loss of one currency\nunit to the holder. In this contract, the holder transfers to the insurer the insignificant risk of\nlosing one currency unit. At the same time, the contract creates non-insurance risk that the issuer\nwill need to pay 999,999 currency units if the specified event occurs. Because the issuer does not\naccept significant insurance risk from the holder, this contract is not an insurance contract.  \n(d) possible reinsurance recoveries. The insurer accounts for these separately.  \nB25 An insurer shall assess the significance of insurance risk contract by contract, rather than by reference to\nmateriality to the financial statements.[6] Thus, insurance risk may be significant even if there is a minimal\nprobability of material losses for a whole book of contracts. This contract-by-contract assessment makes it\neasier to classify a contract as an insurance contract. However, if a relatively homogeneous book of small\ncontracts is known to consist of contracts that all transfer insurance risk, an insurer need not examine each\ncontract within that book to identify a few non-derivative contracts that transfer insignificant insurance risk.  \nB26 It follows from paragraphs B23\u2013B25 that if a contract pays a death benefit exceeding the amount payable\non survival, the contract is an insurance contract unless the additional death benefit is insignificant (judged\nby reference to the contract rather than to an entire book of contracts). As noted in paragraph B24(b), the\nwaiver on death of cancellation or surrender charges is not included in this assessment if this waiver does\nnot compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk. Similarly, an annuity contract that pays out regular\nsums for the rest of a policyholder\u2019s life is an insurance contract, unless the aggregate life-contingent\npayments are insignificant.  \nB27 Paragraph B23 refers to additional benefits. These additional benefits could include a requirement to pay\nbenefits earlier if the insured event occurs earlier and the payment is not adjusted for the time value of\nmoney. An example is whole life insurance for a fixed amount (in other words, insurance that provides a\nfixed death benefit whenever the policyholder dies, with no expiry date for the cover). It is certain that the\npolicyholder will die, but the date of death is uncertain. The insurer will suffer a loss on those individual\ncontracts for which policyholders die early, even if there is no overall loss on the whole book of contracts.  \nB28 If an insurance contract is unbundled into a deposit component and an insurance component, the\nsignificance of insurance risk transfer is assessed by reference to the insurance component. The significance\nof insurance risk transferred by an embedded derivative is assessed by reference to the embedded\nderivative.",

        "page_content=": "## Changes in the level of insurance risk  \nB29 Some contracts do not transfer any insurance risk to the issuer at inception, although they do transfer\ninsurance risk at a later time. For example, consider a contract that provides a specified investment return\nand includes an option for the policyholder to use the proceeds of the investment on maturity to buy a lifecontingent annuity at the current annuity rates charged by the insurer to other new annuitants when the\npolicyholder exercises the option. The contract transfers no insurance risk to the issuer until the option is\nexercised, because the insurer remains free to price the annuity on a basis that reflects the insurance risk\ntransferred to the insurer at that time. However, if the contract specifies the annuity rates (or a basis for\nsetting the annuity rates), the contract transfers insurance risk to the issuer at inception.  \nB30 A contract that qualifies as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and\nobligations are extinguished or expire.  \n6 For this purpose, contracts entered into simultaneously with a single counterparty (or contracts that are otherwise interdependent) form a\nsingle contract.  \n-----  ",
