The objective of AASB 17 is to**\n**ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. This**\n**information gives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that insurance contracts**\n**have on the entity\u2019s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.**  \nAusCF1 AusCF entities are:  \n(a) not-for-profit entities; and  \n(b) for-profit entities that are not applying the _Conceptual Framework for Financial_\n_Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards)._  \nFor AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is defined in AASB 1057 _Application of_\n_Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the_\n_Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities applying the_ _Conceptual Framework for_\n_Financial Reporting are set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework._  \n2 An entity shall consider its substantive rights and obligations, whether they arise from a contract, law or\nregulation, when applying AASB 17. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates\nenforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of\nlaw. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity\u2019s customary business practices. Contractual terms\ninclude all terms in a contract, explicit or implied, but an entity shall disregard terms that have no\ncommercial substance (ie no discernible effect on the economics of the contract). Implied terms in a\ncontract include those imposed by law or regulation. The practices and processes for establishing contracts\nwith customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an\nentity (for example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or\nservices).",

The issuer may make that choice contract by contract, but the\nchoice for each contract is irrevocable.  \n(f) contingent consideration payable or receivable in a business combination (see AASB 3 Business\n_Combinations)._  \n(g) insurance contracts in which the entity is the policyholder, unless those contracts are reinsurance\ncontracts held (see paragraph 3(b)).  \n(h) credit card contracts, or similar contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements, that meet\nthe definition of an insurance contract if, and only if, the entity does not reflect an assessment of\nthe insurance risk associated with an individual customer in setting the price of the contract with\nthat customer (see AASB 9 and other applicable Australian Accounting Standards). However, if,\nand only if, AASB 9 requires an entity to separate an insurance coverage component (see\nparagraph 2.1(e)(iv) of AASB 9) that is embedded in such a contract, the entity shall apply AASB\n17 to that component.  \n8 Some contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract but have as their primary purpose the provision\nof services for a fixed fee. An entity may choose to apply AASB 15 instead of AASB 17 to such contracts\nthat it issues if, and only if, specified conditions are met. The entity may make that choice contract by\ncontract, but the choice for each contract is irrevocable.

An entity shall choose to apply either AASB 17 or AASB 9 to such contracts that\nit issues unless such contracts are excluded from the scope of AASB 17 by paragraph 7.

For example, an insurance contract may include an _investment_\n_component or a component for services other than_ _insurance contract services (or both). An entity shall_\napply paragraphs 11\u201313 to identify and account for the components of the contract.  \n11 An entity shall:  \n(a) apply AASB 9 to determine whether there is an embedded derivative to be separated and, if there\nis, how to account for that derivative.  \n(b) separate from a host insurance contract an investment component if, and only if, that investment\ncomponent is distinct (see paragraphs B31\u2013B32). The entity shall apply AASB 9 to account for\nthe separated investment component unless it is an investment contract with discretionary\nparticipation features within the scope of AASB 17 (see paragraph 3(c)).  \n12 After applying paragraph 11 to separate any cash flows related to embedded derivatives and distinct\ninvestment components, an entity shall separate from the host insurance contract any promise to transfer to\na policyholder distinct goods or services other than insurance contract services, applying paragraph 7 of\nAASB 15. The entity shall account for such promises applying AASB 15. In applying paragraph 7 of\nAASB 15 to separate the promise, the entity shall apply paragraphs B33\u2013B35 of AASB 17 and, on initial\nrecognition, shall:  \n(a) apply AASB 15 to attribute the cash inflows between the insurance component and any promises\nto provide distinct goods or services other than insurance contract services; and  \n(b) attribute the cash outflows between the insurance component and any promised goods or services\nother than insurance contract services, accounted for applying AASB 15 so that:  \n(i) cash outflows that relate directly to each component are attributed to that component;\nand  \n(ii) any remaining cash outflows are attributed on a systematic and rational basis, reflecting\nthe cash outflows the entity would expect to arise if that component were a separate\ncontract.  \n13 After applying paragraphs 11\u201312, an entity shall apply AASB 17 to all remaining components of the host\ninsurance contract. Hereafter, all references in AASB 17 to embedded derivatives refer to derivatives that\nhave not been separated from the host insurance contract and all references to investment components refer\nto investment components that have not been separated from the host insurance contract (except those\nreferences in paragraphs B31\u2013B32).",

The requirements for the level of aggregation**\n**of reinsurance contracts held are set out in paragraph 61.**  \n**16** **An entity shall divide a portfolio of insurance contracts issued into a minimum of:**  \n**(a)** **a group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, if any;**  \n**(b)** **a group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming**\n**onerous subsequently, if any; and**  \n**(c)** **a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio, if any.**  \n17 If an entity has reasonable and supportable information to conclude that a set of contracts will all be in the\nsame group applying paragraph 16, it may measure the set of contracts to determine if the contracts are\nonerous (see paragraph 47) and assess the set of contracts to determine if the contracts have no significant\npossibility of becoming onerous subsequently (see paragraph 19). If the entity does not have reasonable and  \n-----  supportable information to conclude that a set of contracts will all be in the same group, it shall determine\nthe group to which contracts belong by considering individual contracts.  \n18 For contracts issued to which an entity applies the premium allocation approach (see paragraphs 53\u201359), the\nentity shall assume no contracts in the portfolio are onerous at initial recognition, unless facts and\ncircumstances indicate otherwise. An entity shall assess whether contracts that are not onerous at initial\nrecognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently by assessing the likelihood of\nchanges in applicable facts and circumstances.  \n19 For contracts issued to which an entity does not apply the premium allocation approach (see paragraphs 53\u2013\n54), an entity shall assess whether contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition have no significant\npossibility of becoming onerous:  \n(a) based on the likelihood of changes in assumptions which, if they occurred, would result in the\ncontracts becoming onerous.  \n(b) using information about estimates provided by the entity\u2019s internal reporting. Hence, in assessing\nwhether contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition have no significant possibility of\nbecoming onerous:  \n(i) an entity shall not disregard information provided by its internal reporting about the\neffect of changes in assumptions on different contracts on the possibility of their\nbecoming onerous; but  \n(ii) an entity is not required to gather additional information beyond that provided by the\nentity\u2019s internal reporting about the effect of changes in assumptions on different\ncontracts.  \n20 If, applying paragraphs 14\u201319, contracts within a portfolio would fall into different groups only because law\nor regulation specifically constrains the entity\u2019s practical ability to set a different price or level of benefits\nfor policyholders with different characteristics, the entity may include those contracts in the same group.\nThe entity shall not apply this paragraph by analogy to other items.  \n21 An entity is permitted to subdivide the groups described in paragraph 16. For example, an entity may\nchoose to divide the portfolios into:  \n(a) more groups that are not onerous at initial recognition \u2013 if the entity\u2019s internal reporting provides\ninformation that distinguishes:  \n(i) different levels of profitability; or  \n(ii) different possibilities of contracts becoming onerous after initial recognition; and  \n(b) more than one group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition \u2013 if the entity\u2019s internal\nreporting provides information at a more detailed level about the extent to which the contracts are\nonerous.  \n**22** **An entity shall not include contracts issued more than one year apart in the same group. To achieve**\n**this the entity shall, if necessary, further divide the groups described in paragraphs 16\u201321.**  \n23 A _group of insurance contracts shall comprise a single contract if that is the result of applying_\nparagraphs 14\u201322.  \n24 An entity shall apply the recognition and measurement requirements of AASB 17 to the groups of contracts\ndetermined by applying paragraphs 14\u201323. An entity shall establish the groups at initial recognition and add\ncontracts to the groups applying paragraph 28. The entity shall not reassess the composition of the groups\nsubsequently. To measure a group of contracts, an entity may estimate the fulfilment cash flows at a higher\nlevel of aggregation than the group or portfolio, provided the entity is able to include the appropriate\nfulfilment cash flows in the measurement of the group, applying paragraphs 32(a), 40(a)(i) and 40(b), by\nallocating such estimates to groups of contracts.",

Applying paragraph 16(a), an entity shall\ngroup such contracts separately from contracts that are not onerous. To the extent that paragraph 17 applies,\nan entity may identify the group of onerous contracts by measuring a set of contracts rather than individual\ncontracts. An entity shall recognise a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow for the group of onerous\ncontracts, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash\nflows and the contractual service margin of the group being zero.  \n48 A group of insurance contracts becomes onerous (or more onerous) on subsequent measurement if the\nfollowing amounts exceed the carrying amount of the contractual service margin:  \n(a) unfavourable changes relating to future service in the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group\narising from changes in estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-financial\nrisk; and  \n(b) for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features, the decrease in the amount of\nthe entity\u2019s share of the fair value of the underlying items.  \nApplying paragraphs 44(c)(i), 45(b)(ii) and 45(c)(ii), an entity shall recognise a loss in profit or loss to the\nextent of that excess.  \n49 An entity shall establish (or increase) a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage for an\nonerous group depicting the losses recognised applying paragraphs 47\u201348.

Variability in the fulfilment cash flows increases\nwith, for example:  \n(a) the extent of future cash flows relating to any derivatives embedded in the contracts; and  \n(b) the length of the coverage period of the group of contracts.  \n55 Using the premium allocation approach, an entity shall measure the liability for remaining coverage as\nfollows:  \n(a) on initial recognition, the carrying amount of the liability is:  \n(i) the premiums, if any, received at initial recognition;  \n(ii) minus any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, unless the entity chooses to\nrecognise the payments as an expense applying paragraph 59(a); and  \n(iii) plus or minus any amount arising from the derecognition at that date of:  \n1. any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows applying paragraph 28C; and  \n2. any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the\ngroup of contracts as specified in paragraph B66A.  \n(b) at the end of each subsequent reporting period, the carrying amount of the liability is the carrying\namount at the start of the reporting period:  \n(i) plus the premiums received in the period;  \n(ii) minus insurance acquisition cash flows; unless the entity chooses to recognise the\npayments as an expense applying paragraph 59(a);  \n(iii) plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows\nrecognised as an expense in the reporting period; unless the entity chooses to recognise\ninsurance acquisition cash flows as an expense applying paragraph 59(a);  \n(iv) plus any adjustment to a financing component, applying paragraph 56;  \n(v) minus the amount recognised as insurance revenue for services provided in that period\n(see paragraph B126); and  \n(vi) minus any investment component paid or transferred to the liability for incurred claims.  \n56 If insurance contracts in the group have a significant financing component, an entity shall adjust the\ncarrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage to reflect the time value of money and the effect of\nfinancial risk using the discount rates specified in paragraph 36, as determined on initial recognition. The\nentity is not required to adjust the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage to reflect the time\nvalue of money and the effect of financial risk if, at initial recognition, the entity expects that the time\nbetween providing each part of the services and the related premium due date is no more than a year.  \n57 If at any time during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance\ncontracts is onerous, an entity shall calculate the difference between:  \n(a) the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage determined applying paragraph 55;\nand  \n(b) the fulfilment cash flows that relate to remaining coverage of the group, applying paragraphs 33\u2013\n37 and B36\u2013B92. However, if, in applying paragraph 59(b), the entity does not adjust the liability  \n-----  for incurred claims for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk, it shall not include\nin the fulfilment cash flows any such adjustment.  \n58 To the extent that the fulfilment cash flows described in paragraph 57(b) exceed the carrying amount\ndescribed in paragraph 57(a), the entity shall recognise a loss in profit or loss and increase the liability for\nremaining coverage.  \n59 In applying the premium allocation approach, an entity:  \n(a) may choose to recognise any insurance acquisition cash flows as expenses when it incurs those\ncosts, provided that the coverage period of each contract in the group at initial recognition is no\nmore than one year.  \n(b) shall measure the liability for incurred claims for the group of insurance contracts at the\nfulfilment cash flows relating to incurred claims, applying paragraphs 33\u201337 and B36\u2013B92.\nHowever, the entity is not required to adjust future cash flows for the time value of money and\nthe effect of financial risk if those cash flows are expected to be paid or received in one year or\nless from the date the claims are incurred.",

In addition, the entity shall include in the estimates of the present value of\nthe future cash flows for the group of reinsurance contracts held the effect of any risk of non-performance\nby the issuer of the reinsurance contract, including the effects of collateral and losses from disputes.  \n64 Instead of applying paragraph 37, an entity shall determine the risk adjustment for non-financial risk so that\nit represents the amount of risk being transferred by the holder of the group of reinsurance contracts to the\nissuer of those contracts.  \n65 The requirements of paragraph 38 that relate to determining the contractual service margin on initial\nrecognition are modified to reflect the fact that for a group of reinsurance contracts held there is no\nunearned profit but instead a net cost or net gain on purchasing the reinsurance. Hence, unless paragraph\n65A applies, on initial recognition the entity shall recognise any net cost or net gain on purchasing the\ngroup of reinsurance contracts held as a contractual service margin measured at an amount equal to the sum\nof:  \n(a) the fulfilment cash flows;  \n(b) the amount derecognised at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows\nrelated to the group of reinsurance contracts held;  \n-----  (c) any cash flows arising at that date; and  \n(d) any income recognised in profit or loss applying paragraph 66A.  \n65A If the net cost of purchasing reinsurance coverage relates to events that occurred before the purchase of the\ngroup of reinsurance contracts held, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph B5, the entity shall\nrecognise such a cost immediately in profit or loss as an expense.  \n66 Instead of applying paragraph 44, an entity shall measure the contractual service margin at the end of the\nreporting period for a group of reinsurance contracts held as the carrying amount determined at the start of\nthe reporting period, adjusted for:  \n(a) the effect of any new contracts added to the group (see paragraph 28);  \n(b) interest accreted on the carrying amount of the contractual service margin, measured at the\ndiscount rates specified in paragraph B72(b);  \n(ba) income recognised in profit or loss in the reporting period applying paragraph 66A;  \n(bb) reversals of a loss-recovery component recognised applying paragraph 66B (see paragraph\nB119F) to the extent those reversals are not changes in the fulfilment cash flows of the group of\nreinsurance contracts held;  \n(c) changes in the fulfilment cash flows, measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph\nB72(c), to the extent that the change relates to future service, unless:  \n(i) the change results from a change in fulfilment cash flows allocated to a group of\nunderlying insurance contracts that does not adjust the contractual service margin for\nthe group of underlying insurance contracts; or  \n(ii) the change results from applying paragraphs 57\u201258 (on onerous contracts), if the entity\nmeasures a group of underlying insurance contracts applying the premium allocation\napproach.  \n(d) the effect of any currency exchange differences arising on the contractual service margin; and  \n(e) the amount recognised in profit or loss because of services received in the period, determined by\nthe allocation of the contractual service margin remaining at the end of the reporting period\n(before any allocation) over the current and remaining coverage period of the group of\nreinsurance contracts held, applying paragraph B119.  \n66A An entity shall adjust the contractual service margin of a group of reinsurance contracts held, and as a result\nrecognise income, when the entity recognises a loss on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying\ninsurance contracts or on addition of onerous underlying insurance contracts to a group (see paragraphs\nB119C\u2012B119E).  \n66B An entity shall establish (or adjust) a loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining coverage for a\ngroup of reinsurance contracts held depicting the recovery of losses recognised applying paragraphs\n66(c)(i)\u2012(ii) and 66A. The loss-recovery component determines the amounts that are presented in profit or\nloss as reversals of recoveries of losses from reinsurance contracts held and are consequently excluded from\nthe allocation of premiums paid to the reinsurer (see paragraph B119F).  \n67 Changes in the fulfilment cash flows that result from changes in the risk of non-performance by the issuer\nof a reinsurance contract held do not relate to future service and shall not adjust the contractual service\nmargin.  \n68 Reinsurance contracts held cannot be onerous.

        "page_content=": "## The distinction between insurance risk and other risks  \nB7 The definition of an insurance contract requires that one party accepts significant insurance risk from\nanother party. AASB 17 defines insurance risk as \u2018risk, other than financial risk, transferred from the holder\nof a contract to the issuer\u2019. A contract that exposes the issuer to financial risk without significant insurance\nrisk is not an insurance contract.  \nB8 The definition of financial risk in Appendix A refers to financial and non-financial variables. Examples of\nnon-financial variables not specific to a party to the contract include an index of earthquake losses in a\nparticular region or temperatures in a particular city. Financial risk excludes risk from non-financial\nvariables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a fire that\ndamages or destroys an asset of that party. Furthermore, the risk of changes in the fair value of a nonfinancial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects changes in the market prices for such assets (ie\na financial variable) and the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a party to a contract (ie a\nnon-financial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car in which the\npolicyholder has an insurable interest exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car\u2019s physical\ncondition, that risk is insurance risk, not financial risk.  \nB9 Some contracts expose the issuer to financial risk in addition to significant insurance risk. For example,\nmany life insurance contracts guarantee a minimum rate of return to policyholders, creating financial risk,\nand at the same time promise death benefits that may significantly exceed the policyholder\u2019s account\nbalance, creating insurance risk in the form of mortality risk. Such contracts are insurance contracts.  \nB10 Under some contracts, an insured event triggers the payment of an amount linked to a price index. Such\ncontracts are insurance contracts, provided that the payment contingent on the insured event could be\nsignificant. For example, a life-contingent annuity linked to a cost-of-living index transfers insurance risk\nbecause the payment is triggered by an uncertain future event \u2013 the survival of the person who receives the\nannuity. The link to the price index is a derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk because the number of\npayments to which the index applies depends on the survival of the annuitant. If the resulting transfer of\ninsurance risk is significant, the derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract, in which case it\nshall not be separated from the host contract (see paragraph 11(a)).  \nB11 Insurance risk is the risk the entity accepts from the policyholder. This means the entity must accept, from\nthe policyholder, a risk to which the policyholder was already exposed. Any new risk created by the\ncontract for the entity or the policyholder is not insurance risk.  \nB12 The definition of an insurance contract refers to an adverse effect on the policyholder. This definition does\nnot limit the payment by the entity to an amount equal to the financial effect of the adverse event. For\nexample, the definition includes \u2018new for old\u2019 insurance coverage that pays the policyholder an amount that\npermits the replacement of a used and damaged asset with a new one. Similarly, the definition does not limit\nthe payment under a life insurance contract to the financial loss suffered by the deceased\u2019s dependants, nor\ndoes it exclude contracts that specify the payment of predetermined amounts to quantify the loss caused by\ndeath or an accident.  \nB13 Some contracts require a payment if a specified uncertain future event occurs, but do not require an adverse\neffect on the policyholder as a precondition for the payment. This type of contract is not an insurance\ncontract even if the holder uses it to mitigate an underlying risk exposure. For example, if the holder uses a\nderivative to hedge an underlying financial or non-financial variable correlated with the cash flows from an\nasset of the entity, the derivative is not an insurance contract because the payment is not conditional on\nwhether the holder is adversely affected by a reduction in the cash flows from the asset. The definition of an\ninsurance contract refers to an uncertain future event for which an adverse effect on the policyholder is a\ncontractual precondition for payment. A contractual precondition does not require the entity to investigate\nwhether the event actually caused an adverse effect, but it does permit the entity to deny the payment if it is\nnot satisfied that the event did cause an adverse effect.  \nB14 Lapse or persistency risk (the risk that the policyholder will cancel the contract earlier or later than the\nissuer had expected when pricing the contract) is not insurance risk because the resulting variability in the\npayment to the policyholder is not contingent on an uncertain future event that adversely affects the\npolicyholder. Similarly, expense risk (ie the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs\nassociated with the servicing of a contract, rather than in the costs associated with insured events) is not\ninsurance risk because an unexpected increase in such expenses does not adversely affect the policyholder.  \nB15 Consequently, a contract that exposes the entity to lapse risk, persistency risk or expense risk is not an\ninsurance contract unless it also exposes the entity to significant insurance risk. However, if the entity\nmitigates its risk by using a second contract to transfer part of the non-insurance risk to another party, the\nsecond contract exposes the other party to insurance risk.  \n-----  B16 An entity can accept significant insurance risk from the policyholder only if the entity is separate from the\npolicyholder. In the case of a mutual entity, the mutual entity accepts risk from each policyholder and pools\nthat risk. Although policyholders bear that pooled risk collectively because they hold the residual interest in\nthe entity, the mutual entity is a separate entity that has accepted the risk.",

        "page_content=": "## Significant insurance risk  \nB17 A contract is an insurance contract only if it transfers significant insurance risk. Paragraphs B7\u2013B16 discuss\ninsurance risk. Paragraphs B18\u2013B23 discuss the assessment of whether the insurance risk is significant.  \nB18 Insurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause the issuer to pay additional amounts\nthat are significant in any single scenario, excluding scenarios that have no commercial substance (ie no\ndiscernible effect on the economics of the transaction). If an insured event could mean significant additional\namounts would be payable in any scenario that has commercial substance, the condition in the previous\nsentence can be met even if the insured event is extremely unlikely, or even if the expected (ie probabilityweighted) present value of the contingent cash flows is a small proportion of the expected present value of\nthe remaining cash flows from the insurance contract.  \nB19 In addition, a contract transfers significant insurance risk only if there is a scenario that has commercial\nsubstance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a present value basis. However, even if a\nreinsurance contract does not expose the issuer to the possibility of a significant loss, that contract is\ndeemed to transfer significant insurance risk if it transfers to the reinsurer substantially all the insurance risk\nrelating to the reinsured portions of the underlying insurance contracts.  \nB20 The additional amounts described in paragraph B18 are determined on a present-value basis. If an insurance\ncontract requires payment when an event with uncertain timing occurs and if the payment is not adjusted for\nthe time value of money, there may be scenarios in which the present value of the payment increases, even\nif its nominal value is fixed. An example is insurance that provides a fixed death benefit when the\npolicyholder dies, with no expiry date for the cover (often referred to as whole-life insurance for a fixed\namount). It is certain that the policyholder will die, but the date of death is uncertain. Payments may be\nmade when an individual policyholder dies earlier than expected. Because those payments are not adjusted\nfor the time value of money, significant insurance risk could exist even if there is no overall loss on the\nportfolio of contracts. Similarly, contractual terms that delay timely reimbursement to the policyholder can\neliminate significant insurance risk. An entity shall use the discount rates required in paragraph 36 to\ndetermine the present value of the additional amounts.  \nB21 The additional amounts described in paragraph B18 refer to the present value of amounts that exceed those\nthat would be payable if no insured event had occurred (excluding scenarios that lack commercial\nsubstance). Those additional amounts include claims handling and assessment costs, but exclude:  \n(a) the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future service. For example, in an investmentlinked life insurance contract, the death of the policyholder means that the entity can no longer\nperform investment management services and collect a fee for doing so. However, this economic\nloss for the entity does not result from insurance risk, just as a mutual fund manager does not take\non insurance risk in relation to the possible death of a client. Consequently, the potential loss of\nfuture investment management fees is not relevant when assessing how much insurance risk is\ntransferred by a contract.  \n(b) a waiver, on death, of charges that would be made on cancellation or surrender. Because the\ncontract brought those charges into existence, their waiver does not compensate the policyholder\nfor a pre-existing risk. Consequently, they are not relevant when assessing how much insurance\nrisk is transferred by a contract.  \n(c) a payment conditional on an event that does not cause a significant loss to the holder of the\ncontract. For example, consider a contract that requires the issuer to pay CU1 million [1] if an asset\nsuffers physical damage that causes an insignificant economic loss of CU1 to the holder. In this\ncontract, the holder transfers the insignificant risk of losing CU1 to the issuer. At the same time,\nthe contract creates a non-insurance risk that the issuer will need to pay CU999,999 if the\nspecified event occurs. Because there is no scenario in which an insured event causes a significant\nloss to the holder of the contract, the issuer does not accept significant insurance risk from the\nholder and this contract is not an insurance contract.  \n(d) possible reinsurance recoveries. The entity accounts for these separately.  \n1 CU denotes currency unit.  \n-----  B22 An entity shall assess the significance of insurance risk contract by contract. Consequently, the insurance\nrisk can be significant even if there is minimal probability of significant losses for a portfolio or group of\ncontracts.  \nB23 It follows from paragraphs B18\u2013B22 that, if a contract pays a death benefit that exceeds the amount payable\non survival, the contract is an insurance contract unless the additional death benefit is not significant\n(judged by reference to the contract itself rather than to an entire portfolio of contracts). As noted in\nparagraph B21(b), the waiver on death of cancellation or surrender charges is not included in this\nassessment if that waiver does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk. Similarly, an annuity\ncontract that pays out regular sums for the rest of a policyholder\u2019s life is an insurance contract, unless the\naggregate life-contingent payments are insignificant.",

        "page_content=": "## Changes in the level of insurance risk  \nB24 For some contracts, the transfer of insurance risk to the issuer occurs after a period of time. For example,\nconsider a contract that provides a specified investment return and includes an option for the policyholder to\nuse the proceeds of the investment on maturity to buy a life-contingent annuity at the same rates the entity\ncharges other new annuitants at the time the policyholder exercises that option. Such a contract transfers\ninsurance risk to the issuer only after the option is exercised, because the entity remains free to price the\nannuity on a basis that reflects the insurance risk that will be transferred to the entity at that time.\nConsequently, the cash flows that would occur on the exercise of the option fall outside the boundary of the\ncontract, and before exercise there are no insurance cash flows within the boundary of the contract.\nHowever, if the contract specifies the annuity rates (or a basis other than market rates for setting the annuity\nrates), the contract transfers insurance risk to the issuer because the issuer is exposed to the risk that the\nannuity rates will be unfavourable to the issuer when the policyholder exercises the option. In that case, the\ncash flows that would occur when the option is exercised are within the boundary of the contract.  \nB25 A contract that meets the definition of an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights\nand obligations are extinguished (ie discharged, cancelled or expired), unless the contract is derecognised\napplying paragraphs 74\u201377, because of a contract modification.",

Product warranties issued by another party for goods sold by a manufacturer,\ndealer or retailer are within the scope of AASB 17. However, product warranties issued directly\nby a manufacturer, dealer or retailer are outside the scope of AASB 17 applying paragraph 7(a),\nand are instead within the scope of AASB 15 or AASB 137 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities_\n_and Contingent Assets._  \n(h) title insurance (insurance against the discovery of defects in the title to land or buildings that were\nnot apparent when the insurance contract was issued). In this case, the insured event is the\ndiscovery of a defect in the title, not the defect itself.  \n(i) travel insurance (compensation in cash or in kind to policyholders for losses suffered in advance\nof, or during, travel).  \n-----  (j) catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, if a specified\nevent adversely affects the issuer of the bond (unless the specified event does not create\nsignificant insurance risk; for example, if the event is a change in an interest rate or a foreign\nexchange rate).  \n(k) insurance swaps and other contracts that require a payment depending on changes in climatic,\ngeological or other physical variables that are specific to a party to the contract.  \nB27 The following are examples of items that are not insurance contracts:  \n(a) investment contracts that have the legal form of an insurance contract but do not transfer\nsignificant insurance risk to the issuer. For example, life insurance contracts in which the entity\nbears no significant mortality or morbidity risk are not insurance contracts; such contracts are\nfinancial instruments or service contracts \u2013 see paragraph B28. Investment contracts with\ndiscretionary participation features do not meet the definition of an insurance contract; however,\nthey are within the scope of AASB 17 provided they are issued by an entity that also issues\ninsurance contracts, applying paragraph 3(c).  \n(b) contracts that have the legal form of insurance, but return all significant insurance risk to the\npolicyholder through non-cancellable and enforceable mechanisms that adjust future payments by\nthe policyholder to the issuer as a direct result of insured losses. For example, some financial\nreinsurance contracts or some group contracts return all significant insurance risk to the\npolicyholders; such contracts are normally financial instruments or service contracts (see\nparagraph B28).  \n(c) self-insurance (ie retaining a risk that could have been covered by insurance). In such situations,\nthere is no insurance contract because there is no agreement with another party. Thus, if an entity\nissues an insurance contract to its parent, subsidiary or fellow subsidiary, there is no insurance\ncontract in the consolidated financial statements because there is no contract with another party.\nHowever, for the individual or separate financial statements of the issuer or holder, there is an\ninsurance contract.  \n(d) contracts (such as gambling contracts) that require a payment if a specified uncertain future event\noccurs, but do not require, as a contractual precondition for payment, the event to adversely affect\nthe policyholder. However, this does not exclude from the definition of an insurance contract\ncontracts that specify a predetermined payout to quantify the loss caused by a specified event\nsuch as a death or an accident (see paragraph B12).  \n(e) derivatives that expose a party to financial risk but not insurance risk, because the derivatives\nrequire that party to make (or give them the right to receive) payment solely based on the changes\nin one or more of a specified interest rate, a financial instrument price, a commodity price, a\nforeign exchange rate, an index of prices or rates, a credit rating or a credit index or any other\nvariable, provided that, in the case of a non-financial variable, the variable is not specific to a\nparty to the contract.  \n(f) credit-related guarantees that require payments even if the holder has not incurred a loss on the\nfailure of the debtor to make payments when due; such contracts are accounted for applying\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (see paragraph B29).  \n(g) contracts that require a payment that depends on a climatic, geological or any other physical\nvariable not specific to a party to the contract (commonly described as weather derivatives).  \n(h) contracts that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, that depend on a\nclimatic, geological or any other physical variable, the effect of which is not specific to a party to\nthe contract (commonly referred to as catastrophe bonds).  \nB28 An entity shall apply other applicable Standards, such as AASB 9 and AASB 15, to the contracts described\nin paragraph B27.  \nB29 The credit-related guarantees and credit insurance contracts discussed in paragraph B27(f) can have various\nlegal forms, such as that of a guarantee, some types of letters of credit, a credit default contract or an\ninsurance contract. Those contracts are insurance contracts if they require the issuer to make specified\npayments to reimburse the holder for a loss that the holder incurs because a specified debtor fails to make\npayment when due to the policyholder applying the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\nHowever, such insurance contracts are excluded from the scope of AASB 17 unless the issuer has\npreviously asserted explicitly that it regards the contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting\napplicable to insurance contracts (see paragraph 7(e)).  \nB30 Credit-related guarantees and credit insurance contracts that require payment, even if the policyholder has\nnot incurred a loss on the failure of the debtor to make payments when due, are outside the scope of  \n-----  AASB 17 because they do not transfer significant insurance risk. Such contracts include those that require\npayment:  \n(a) regardless of whether the counterparty holds the underlying debt instrument; or  \n(b) on a change in the credit rating or the credit index, rather than on the failure of a specified debtor\nto make payments when due.",

Reasonable and supportable information\navailable at the reporting date without undue cost or effort includes information about past events and\ncurrent conditions, and forecasts of future conditions (see paragraph B41). Information available from an\nentity\u2019s own information systems is considered to be available without undue cost or effort.  \nB38 The starting point for an estimate of the cash flows is a range of scenarios that reflects the full range of\npossible outcomes. Each scenario specifies the amount and timing of the cash flows for a particular\noutcome, and the estimated probability of that outcome. The cash flows from each scenario are discounted\nand weighted by the estimated probability of that outcome to derive an expected present value.\nConsequently, the objective is not to develop a most likely outcome, or a more-likely-than-not outcome, for\nfuture cash flows.  \nB39 When considering the full range of possible outcomes, the objective is to incorporate all reasonable and\nsupportable information available without undue cost or effort in an unbiased way, rather than to identify  \n-----  every possible scenario. In practice, developing explicit scenarios is unnecessary if the resulting estimate is\nconsistent with the measurement objective of considering all reasonable and supportable information\navailable without undue cost or effort when determining the mean. For example, if an entity estimates that\nthe probability distribution of outcomes is broadly consistent with a probability distribution that can be\ndescribed completely with a small number of parameters, it will be sufficient to estimate the smaller number\nof parameters. Similarly, in some cases, relatively simple modelling may give an answer within an\nacceptable range of precision, without the need for many detailed simulations. However, in some cases, the\ncash flows may be driven by complex underlying factors and may respond in a non-linear fashion to\nchanges in economic conditions. This may happen if, for example, the cash flows reflect a series of\ninterrelated options that are implicit or explicit. In such cases, more sophisticated stochastic modelling is\nlikely to be necessary to satisfy the measurement objective.  \nB40 The scenarios developed shall include unbiased estimates of the probability of catastrophic losses under\nexisting contracts. Those scenarios exclude possible claims under possible future contracts.  \nB41 An entity shall estimate the probabilities and amounts of future payments under existing contracts on the\nbasis of information obtained including:  \n(a) information about claims already reported by policyholders.  \n(b) other information about the known or estimated characteristics of the insurance contracts.  \n(c) historical data about the entity\u2019s own experience, supplemented when necessary with historical\ndata from other sources. Historical data is adjusted to reflect current conditions, for example, if:  \n(i) the characteristics of the insured population differ (or will differ, for example, because\nof adverse selection) from those of the population that has been used as a basis for the\nhistorical data;  \n(ii) there are indications that historical trends will not continue, that new trends will emerge\nor that economic, demographic and other changes may affect the cash flows that arise\nfrom the existing insurance contracts; or  \n(iii) there have been changes in items such as underwriting procedures and claims\nmanagement procedures that may affect the relevance of historical data to the insurance\ncontracts.  \n(d) current price information, if available, for reinsurance contracts and other financial instruments (if\nany) covering similar risks, such as catastrophe bonds and weather derivatives, and recent market\nprices for transfers of insurance contracts. This information shall be adjusted to reflect the\ndifferences between the cash flows that arise from those reinsurance contracts or other financial\ninstruments, and the cash flows that would arise as the entity fulfils the underlying contracts with\nthe policyholder.",

        "page_content=": "### Market variables and non-market variables\nB42 AASB 17 identifies two types of variables:  \n(a) market variables \u2013 variables that can be observed in, or derived directly from, markets (for\nexample, prices of publicly traded securities and interest rates); and  \n(b) non-market variables \u2013 all other variables (for example, the frequency and severity of insurance\nclaims and mortality).  \nB43 Market variables will generally give rise to financial risk (for example, observable interest rates) and nonmarket variables will generally give rise to non-financial risk (for example, mortality rates). However, this\nwill not always be the case. For example, there may be assumptions that relate to financial risks for which\nvariables cannot be observed in, or derived directly from, markets (for example, interest rates that cannot be\nobserved in, or derived directly from, markets).  \n_Market variables (paragraph 33(b))_  \nB44 Estimates of market variables shall be consistent with observable market prices at the measurement date. An\nentity shall maximise the use of observable inputs and shall not substitute its own estimates for observable\nmarket data except as described in paragraph 79 of AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement. Consistent with_\nAASB 13, if variables need to be derived (for example, because no observable market variables exist) they\nshall be as consistent as possible with observable market variables.  \n-----  B45 Market prices blend a range of views about possible future outcomes and also reflect the risk preferences of\nmarket participants. Consequently, they are not a single-point forecast of the future outcome. If the actual\noutcome differs from the previous market price, this does not mean that the market price was \u2018wrong\u2019.  \nB46 An important application of market variables is the notion of a replicating asset or a replicating portfolio of\nassets. A replicating asset is one whose cash flows exactly match, in all scenarios, the contractual cash flows\nof a group of insurance contracts in amount, timing and uncertainty. In some cases, a replicating asset may\nexist for some of the cash flows that arise from a group of insurance contracts. The fair value of that asset\nreflects both the expected present value of the cash flows from the asset and the risk associated with those\ncash flows. If a replicating portfolio of assets exists for some of the cash flows that arise from a group of\ninsurance contracts, the entity can use the fair value of those assets to measure the relevant fulfilment cash\nflows instead of explicitly estimating the cash flows and discount rate.  \nB47 AASB 17 does not require an entity to use a replicating portfolio technique. However, if a replicating asset\nor portfolio does exist for some of the cash flows that arise from insurance contracts and an entity chooses\nto use a different technique, the entity shall satisfy itself that a replicating portfolio technique would be\nunlikely to lead to a materially different measurement of those cash flows.  \nB48 Techniques other than a replicating portfolio technique, such as stochastic modelling techniques, may be\nmore robust or easier to implement if there are significant interdependencies between cash flows that vary\nbased on returns on assets and other cash flows. Judgement is required to determine the technique that best\nmeets the objective of consistency with observable market variables in specific circumstances. In particular,\nthe technique used must result in the measurement of any options and guarantees included in the insurance\ncontracts being consistent with observable market prices (if any) for such options and guarantees.  \n_Non-market variables_  \nB49 Estimates of non-market variables shall reflect all reasonable and supportable evidence available without\nundue cost or effort, both external and internal.  \nB50 Non-market external data (for example, national mortality statistics) may have more or less relevance than\ninternal data (for example, internally developed mortality statistics), depending on the circumstances. For\nexample, an entity that issues life insurance contracts shall not rely solely on national mortality statistics,\nbut shall consider all other reasonable and supportable internal and external sources of information available\nwithout undue cost or effort when developing unbiased estimates of probabilities for mortality scenarios for\nits insurance contracts. In developing those probabilities, an entity shall give more weight to the more\npersuasive information. For example:  \n(a) internal mortality statistics may be more persuasive than national mortality data if national data is\nderived from a large population that is not representative of the insured population. This might be\nbecause, for example, the demographic characteristics of the insured population could\nsignificantly differ from those of the national population, meaning that an entity would need to\nplace more weight on the internal data and less weight on the national statistics.  \n(b) conversely, if the internal statistics are derived from a small population with characteristics that\nare believed to be close to those of the national population, and the national statistics are current,\nan entity shall place more weight on the national statistics.  \nB51 Estimated probabilities for non-market variables shall not contradict observable market variables. For\nexample, estimated probabilities for future inflation rate scenarios shall be as consistent as possible with\nprobabilities implied by market interest rates.  \nB52 In some cases, an entity may conclude that market variables vary independently of non-market variables. If\nso, the entity shall consider scenarios that reflect the range of outcomes for the non-market variables, with\neach scenario using the same observed value of the market variable.  \nB53 In other cases, market variables and non-market variables may be correlated. For example, there may be\nevidence that lapse rates (a non-market variable) are correlated with interest rates (a market variable).\nSimilarly, there may be evidence that claim levels for house or car insurance are correlated with economic\ncycles and therefore with interest rates and expense amounts. The entity shall ensure that the probabilities\nfor the scenarios and the risk adjustments for the non-financial risk that relates to the market variables are\nconsistent with the observed market prices that depend on those market variables.",

An entity shall review the estimates that it made at the\nend of the previous reporting period and update them. In doing so, an entity shall consider whether:  \n-----  (a) the updated estimates faithfully represent the conditions at the end of the reporting period.  \n(b) the changes in estimates faithfully represent the changes in conditions during the period. For\nexample, suppose that estimates were at one end of a reasonable range at the beginning of the\nperiod. If the conditions have not changed, shifting the estimates to the other end of the range at\nthe end of the period would not faithfully represent what has happened during the period. If an\nentity\u2019s most recent estimates are different from its previous estimates, but conditions have not\nchanged, it shall assess whether the new probabilities assigned to each scenario are justified. In\nupdating its estimates of those probabilities, the entity shall consider both the evidence that\nsupported its previous estimates and all newly available evidence, giving more weight to the more\npersuasive evidence.  \nB55 The probability assigned to each scenario shall reflect the conditions at the end of the reporting period.\nConsequently, applying AASB 110 Events after the Reporting Period, an event occurring after the end of\nthe reporting period that resolves an uncertainty that existed at the end of the reporting period does not\nprovide evidence of the conditions that existed at that date. For example, there may be a 20 per cent\nprobability at the end of the reporting period that a major storm will strike during the remaining six months\nof an insurance contract. After the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are\nauthorised for issue, a major storm strikes. The fulfilment cash flows under that contract shall not reflect the\nstorm that, with hindsight, is known to have occurred. Instead, the cash flows included in the measurement\ninclude the 20 per cent probability apparent at the end of the reporting period (with disclosure applying\nAASB 110 that a non-adjusting event occurred after the end of the reporting period).  \nB56 Current estimates of expected cash flows are not necessarily identical to the most recent actual experience.\nFor example, suppose that mortality experience in the reporting period was 20 per cent worse than the\nprevious mortality experience and previous expectations of mortality experience. Several factors could have\ncaused the sudden change in experience, including:  \n(a) lasting changes in mortality;  \n(b) changes in the characteristics of the insured population (for example, changes in underwriting or\ndistribution, or selective lapses by policyholders in unusually good health);  \n(c) random fluctuations; or  \n(d) identifiable non-recurring causes.  \nB57 An entity shall investigate the reasons for the change in experience and develop new estimates of cash flows\nand probabilities in the light of the most recent experience, the earlier experience and other information.\nThe result for the example in paragraph B56 would typically be that the expected present value of death\nbenefits changes, but not by as much as 20 per cent. In the example in paragraph B56, if mortality rates\ncontinue to be significantly higher than the previous estimates for reasons that are expected to continue, the\nestimated probability assigned to the high-mortality scenarios will increase.  \nB58 Estimates of non-market variables shall include information about the current level of insured events and\ninformation about trends. For example, mortality rates have consistently declined over long periods in many\ncountries. The determination of the fulfilment cash flows reflects the probabilities that would be assigned to\neach possible trend scenario, taking account of all reasonable and supportable information available without\nundue cost or effort.  \nB59 Similarly, if cash flows allocated to a group of insurance contracts are sensitive to inflation, the\ndetermination of the fulfilment cash flows shall reflect current estimates of possible future inflation rates.\nBecause inflation rates are likely to be correlated with interest rates, the measurement of fulfilment cash\nflows shall reflect the probabilities for each inflation scenario in a way that is consistent with the\nprobabilities implied by the market interest rates used in estimating the discount rate (see paragraph B51).  \nB60 When estimating the cash flows, an entity shall take into account current expectations of future events that\nmight affect those cash flows. The entity shall develop cash flow scenarios that reflect those future events,\nas well as unbiased estimates of the probability of each scenario. However, an entity shall not take into\naccount current expectations of future changes in legislation that would change or discharge the present\nobligation or create new obligations under the existing insurance contract until the change in legislation is\nsubstantively enacted.",

An entity shall apply paragraph 2 in determining the boundary of an existing\ncontract.  \n-----  B62 Many insurance contracts have features that enable policyholders to take actions that change the amount,\ntiming, nature or uncertainty of the amounts they will receive. Such features include renewal options,\nsurrender options, conversion options and options to stop paying premiums while still receiving benefits\nunder the contracts. The measurement of a group of insurance contracts shall reflect, on an expected value\nbasis, the entity\u2019s current estimates of how the policyholders in the group will exercise the options\navailable, and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall reflect the entity\u2019s current estimates of how\nthe actual behaviour of the policyholders may differ from the expected behaviour. This requirement to\ndetermine the expected value applies regardless of the number of contracts in a group; for example it\napplies even if the group comprises a single contract. Thus, the measurement of a group of insurance\ncontracts shall not assume a 100 per cent probability that policyholders will:  \n(a) surrender their contracts, if there is some probability that some of the policyholders will not; or  \n(b) continue their contracts, if there is some probability that some of the policyholders will not.  \nB63 When an issuer of an insurance contract is required by the contract to renew or otherwise continue the\ncontract, it shall apply paragraph 34 to assess whether premiums and related cash flows that arise from the\nrenewed contract are within the boundary of the original contract.  \nB64 Paragraph 34 refers to an entity\u2019s practical ability to set a price at a future date (a renewal date) that fully\nreflects the risks in the contract from that date. An entity has that practical ability in the absence of\nconstraints that prevent the entity from setting the same price it would for a new contract with the same\ncharacteristics as the existing contract issued on that date, or if it can amend the benefits to be consistent\nwith the price it will charge. Similarly, an entity has that practical ability to set a price when it can reprice\nan existing contract so that the price reflects overall changes in the risks in a portfolio of insurance\ncontracts, even if the price set for each individual policyholder does not reflect the change in risk for that\nspecific policyholder. When assessing whether the entity has the practical ability to set a price that fully\nreflects the risks in the contract or portfolio, it shall consider all the risks that it would consider when\nunderwriting equivalent contracts on the renewal date for the remaining service. In determining the\nestimates of future cash flows at the end of a reporting period, an entity shall reassess the boundary of an\ninsurance contract to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the entity\u2019s substantive rights and\nobligations.  \nB65 Cash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract are those that relate directly to the fulfilment of the\ncontract, including cash flows for which the entity has discretion over the amount or timing. The cash flows\nwithin the boundary include:  \n(a) premiums (including premium adjustments and instalment premiums) from a policyholder and\nany additional cash flows that result from those premiums.  \n(b) payments to (or on behalf of) a policyholder, including claims that have already been reported but\nhave not yet been paid (ie reported claims), incurred claims for events that have occurred but for\nwhich claims have not been reported and all future claims for which the entity has a substantive\nobligation (see paragraph 34).  \n(c) payments to (or on behalf of) a policyholder that vary depending on returns on underlying items.  \n(d) payments to (or on behalf of) a policyholder resulting from derivatives, for example, options and\nguarantees embedded in the contract, to the extent that those options and guarantees are not\nseparated from the insurance contract (see paragraph 11(a)).  \n(e) an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows attributable to the portfolio to which the contract\nbelongs.  \n(f) claim handling costs (ie the costs the entity will incur in investigating, processing and resolving\nclaims under existing insurance contracts, including legal and loss-adjusters\u2019 fees and internal\ncosts of investigating claims and processing claim payments).  \n(g) costs the entity will incur in providing contractual benefits paid in kind.  \n(h) policy administration and maintenance costs, such as costs of premium billing and handling\npolicy changes (for example, conversions and reinstatements). Such costs also include recurring\ncommissions that are expected to be paid to intermediaries if a particular policyholder continues\nto pay the premiums within the boundary of the insurance contract.  \n(i) transaction-based taxes (such as premium taxes, value added taxes and goods and services taxes)\nand levies (such as fire service levies and guarantee fund assessments) that arise directly from\nexisting insurance contracts, or that can be attributed to them on a reasonable and consistent\nbasis.  \n(j) payments by the insurer in a fiduciary capacity to meet tax obligations incurred by the\npolicyholder, and related receipts.  \n-----  (k) potential cash inflows from recoveries (such as salvage and subrogation) on future claims covered\nby existing insurance contracts and, to the extent that they do not qualify for recognition as\nseparate assets, potential cash inflows from recoveries on past claims.  \n(ka) costs the entity will incur:  \n(i) performing investment activity, to the extent the entity performs that activity to\nenhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders. Investment activities\nenhance benefits from insurance coverage if the entity performs those activities\nexpecting to generate an investment return from which policyholders will benefit if an\ninsured event occurs.  \n(ii) providing investment-return service to policyholders of insurance contracts without\ndirect participation features (see paragraph B119B).  \n(iii) providing investment-related service to policyholders of insurance contracts with direct\nparticipation features.  \n(l) an allocation of fixed and variable overheads (such as the costs of accounting, human resources,\ninformation technology and support, building depreciation, rent, and maintenance and utilities)\ndirectly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts. Such overheads are allocated to groups of\ncontracts using methods that are systematic and rational, and are consistently applied to all costs\nthat have similar characteristics.  \n(m) any other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract.  \nB66 The following cash flows shall not be included when estimating the cash flows that will arise as the entity\nfulfils an existing insurance contract:  \n(a) investment returns. Investments are recognised, measured and presented separately.  \n(b) cash flows (payments or receipts) that arise under reinsurance contracts held. Reinsurance\ncontracts held are recognised, measured and presented separately.  \n(c) cash flows that may arise from future insurance contracts, ie cash flows outside the boundary of\nexisting contracts (see paragraphs 34\u201335).  \n(d) cash flows relating to costs that cannot be directly attributed to the portfolio of insurance\ncontracts that contain the contract, such as some product development and training costs. Such\ncosts are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.  \n(e) cash flows that arise from abnormal amounts of wasted labour or other resources that are used to\nfulfil the contract. Such costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.  \n(f) income tax payments and receipts the insurer does not pay or receive in a fiduciary capacity or\nthat are not specifically chargeable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract.  \n(g) cash flows between different components of the reporting entity, such as policyholder funds and\nshareholder funds, if those cash flows do not change the amount that will be paid to the\npolicyholders.  \n(h) cash flows arising from components separated from the insurance contract and accounted for\nusing other applicable Standards (see paragraphs 10\u201313).  \nB66A Before the recognition of a group of insurance contracts, an entity might be required to recognise an asset or\nliability for cash flows related to the group of insurance contracts other than insurance acquisition cash\nflows either because of the occurrence of the cash flows or because of the requirements of another\nAustralian Accounting Standard. Cash flows are related to the group of insurance contracts if those cash\nflows would have been included in the fulfilment cash flows at the date of initial recognition of the group\nhad they been paid or received after that date. To apply paragraph 38(c)(ii) an entity shall derecognise such\nan asset or liability to the extent that the asset or liability would not be recognised separately from the group\nof insurance contracts if the cash flow or the application of the Australian Accounting Standard occurred at\nthe date of initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts.  \n_Contracts with cash flows that affect or are affected by cash flows to policyholders of_\n_other contracts_  \nB67 Some insurance contracts affect the cash flows to policyholders of other contracts by requiring:  \n(a) the policyholder to share with policyholders of other contracts the returns on the same specified\npool of underlying items; and  \n(b) either:  \n-----  (i) the policyholder to bear a reduction in their share of the returns on the underlying items\nbecause of payments to policyholders of other contracts that share in that pool,\nincluding payments arising under guarantees made to policyholders of those other\ncontracts; or  \n(ii) policyholders of other contracts to bear a reduction in their share of returns on the\nunderlying items because of payments to the policyholder, including payments arising\nfrom guarantees made to the policyholder.  \nB68 Sometimes, such contracts will affect the cash flows to policyholders of contracts in other groups. The\nfulfilment cash flows of each group reflect the extent to which the contracts in the group cause the entity to\nbe affected by expected cash flows, whether to policyholders in that group or to policyholders in another\ngroup. Hence the fulfilment cash flows for a group:  \n(a) include payments arising from the terms of existing contracts to policyholders of contracts in\nother groups, regardless of whether those payments are expected to be made to current or future\npolicyholders; and  \n(b) exclude payments to policyholders in the group that, applying (a), have been included in the\nfulfilment cash flows of another group.  \nB69 For example, to the extent that payments to policyholders in one group are reduced from a share in the\nreturns on underlying items of CU350 to CU250 because of payments of a guaranteed amount to\npolicyholders in another group, the fulfilment cash flows of the first group would include the payments of\nCU100 (ie would be CU350) and the fulfilment cash flows of the second group would exclude CU100 of\nthe guaranteed amount.  \nB70 Different practical approaches can be used to determine the fulfilment cash flows of groups of contracts that\naffect or are affected by cash flows to policyholders of contracts in other groups. In some cases, an entity\nmight be able to identify the change in the underlying items and resulting change in the cash flows only at a\nhigher level of aggregation than the groups. In such cases, the entity shall allocate the effect of the change\nin the underlying items to each group on a systematic and rational basis.  \nB71 After all insurance contract services have been provided to the contracts in a group, the fulfilment cash\nflows may still include payments expected to be made to current policyholders in other groups or future\npolicyholders. An entity is not required to continue to allocate such fulfilment cash flows to specific groups\nbut can instead recognise and measure a liability for such fulfilment cash flows arising from all groups.",

The variability is a relevant factor regardless of whether it arises\nbecause of contractual terms or because the entity exercises discretion, and regardless of whether the entity\nholds the underlying items.  \nB76 Cash flows that vary with returns on underlying items with variable returns, but that are subject to a\nguarantee of a minimum return, do not vary solely based on the returns on the underlying items, even when\nthe guaranteed amount is lower than the expected return on the underlying items. Hence, an entity shall\nadjust the rate that reflects the variability of the returns on the underlying items for the effect of the\nguarantee, even when the guaranteed amount is lower than the expected return on the underlying items.  \nB77 AASB 17 does not require an entity to divide estimated cash flows into those that vary based on the returns\non underlying items and those that do not. If an entity does not divide the estimated cash flows in this way,\nthe entity shall apply discount rates appropriate for the estimated cash flows as a whole; for example, using\nstochastic modelling techniques or risk-neutral measurement techniques.  \nB78 Discount rates shall include only relevant factors, ie factors that arise from the time value of money, the\ncharacteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. Such discount\nrates may not be directly observable in the market. Hence, when observable market rates for an instrument\nwith the same characteristics are not available, or observable market rates for similar instruments are\navailable but do not separately identify the factors that distinguish the instrument from the insurance\ncontracts, an entity shall estimate the appropriate rates. AASB 17 does not require a particular estimation\ntechnique for determining discount rates. In applying an estimation technique, an entity shall:  \n(a) maximise the use of observable inputs (see paragraph B44) and reflect all reasonable and\nsupportable information on non-market variables available without undue cost or effort, both\nexternal and internal (see paragraph B49). In particular, the discount rates used shall not\ncontradict any available and relevant market data, and any non-market variables used shall not\ncontradict observable market variables.  \n(b) reflect current market conditions from the perspective of a market participant.  \n(c) exercise judgement to assess the degree of similarity between the features of the insurance\ncontracts being measured and the features of the instrument for which observable market prices\nare available and adjust those prices to reflect the differences between them.  \nB79 For cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items, the discount\nrate reflects the yield curve in the appropriate currency for instruments that expose the holder to no or\nnegligible credit risk, adjusted to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the group of insurance contracts.\nThat adjustment shall reflect the difference between the liquidity characteristics of the group of insurance\ncontracts and the liquidity characteristics of the assets used to determine the yield curve. Yield curves  \n-----  reflect assets traded in active markets that the holder can typically sell readily at any time without incurring\nsignificant costs. In contrast, under some insurance contracts the entity cannot be forced to make payments\nearlier than the occurrence of insured events, or dates specified in the contracts.  \nB80 Hence, for cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items, an\nentity may determine discount rates by adjusting a liquid risk-free yield curve to reflect the differences\nbetween the liquidity characteristics of the financial instruments that underlie the rates observed in the\nmarket and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts (a bottom-up approach).  \nB81 Alternatively, an entity may determine the appropriate discount rates for insurance contracts based on a\nyield curve that reflects the current market rates of return implicit in a fair value measurement of a reference\nportfolio of assets (a top-down approach). An entity shall adjust that yield curve to eliminate any factors\nthat are not relevant to the insurance contracts, but is not required to adjust the yield curve for differences in\nliquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts and the reference portfolio.  \nB82 In estimating the yield curve described in paragraph B81:  \n(a) if there are observable market prices in active markets for assets in the reference portfolio, an\nentity shall use those prices (consistent with paragraph 69 of AASB 13).  \n(b) if a market is not active, an entity shall adjust observable market prices for similar assets to make\nthem comparable to market prices for the assets being measured (consistent with paragraph 83 of\nAASB 13).  \n(c) if there is no market for assets in the reference portfolio, an entity shall apply an estimation\ntechnique. For such assets (consistent with paragraph 89 of AASB 13) an entity shall:  \n(i) develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances.\nSuch inputs might include the entity\u2019s own data and, in the context of AASB 17, the\nentity might place more weight on long-term estimates than on short-term fluctuations;\nand  \n(ii) adjust those data to reflect all information about market participant assumptions that is\nreasonably available.  \nB83 In adjusting the yield curve, an entity shall adjust market rates observed in recent transactions in\ninstruments with similar characteristics for movements in market factors since the transaction date, and\nshall adjust observed market rates to reflect the degree of dissimilarity between the instrument being\nmeasured and the instrument for which transaction prices are observable. For cash flows of insurance\ncontracts that do not vary based on the returns on the assets in the reference portfolio, such adjustments\ninclude:  \n(a) adjusting for differences between the amount, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows of the\nassets in the portfolio and the amount, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows of the insurance\ncontracts; and  \n(b) excluding market risk premiums for credit risk, which are relevant only to the assets included in\nthe reference portfolio.  \nB84 In principle, for cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns of the assets in the\nreference portfolio, there should be a single illiquid risk-free yield curve that eliminates all uncertainty\nabout the amount and timing of cash flows. However, in practice the top-down approach and the bottom-up\napproach may result in different yield curves, even in the same currency. This is because of the inherent\nlimitations in estimating the adjustments made under each approach, and the possible lack of an adjustment\nfor different liquidity characteristics in the top-down approach. An entity is not required to reconcile the\ndiscount rate determined under its chosen approach with the discount rate that would have been determined\nunder the other approach.  \nB85 AASB 17 does not specify restrictions on the reference portfolio of assets used in applying paragraph B81.\nHowever, fewer adjustments would be required to eliminate factors that are not relevant to the insurance\ncontracts when the reference portfolio of assets has similar characteristics. For example, if the cash flows\nfrom the insurance contracts do not vary based on the returns on underlying items, fewer adjustments would\nbe required if an entity used debt instruments as a starting point rather than equity instruments. For debt\ninstruments, the objective would be to eliminate from the total bond yield the effect of credit risk and other\nfactors that are not relevant to the insurance contracts. One way to estimate the effect of credit risk is to use\nthe market price of a credit derivative as a reference point.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk (paragraph 37)  \nB86 The risk adjustment for non-financial risk relates to risk arising from insurance contracts other than\nfinancial risk. Financial risk is included in the estimates of the future cash flows or the discount rate used to\nadjust the cash flows. The risks covered by the risk adjustment for non-financial risk are insurance risk and\nother non-financial risks such as lapse risk and expense risk (see paragraph B14).  \nB87 The risk adjustment for non-financial risk for insurance contracts measures the compensation that the entity\nwould require to make the entity indifferent between:  \n(a) fulfilling a liability that has a range of possible outcomes arising from non-financial risk; and  \n(b) fulfilling a liability that will generate fixed cash flows with the same expected present value as\nthe insurance contracts.  \nFor example, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk would measure the compensation the entity would\nrequire to make it indifferent between fulfilling a liability that \u2013 because of non-financial risk \u2013 has a 50 per\ncent probability of being CU90 and a 50 per cent probability of being CU110, and fulfilling a liability that is\nfixed at CU100. As a result, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk conveys information to users of\nfinancial statements about the amount charged by the entity for the uncertainty arising from non-financial\nrisk about the amount and timing of cash flows.  \nB88 Because the risk adjustment for non-financial risk reflects the compensation the entity would require for\nbearing the non-financial risk arising from the uncertain amount and timing of the cash flows, the risk\nadjustment for non-financial risk also reflects:  \n(a) the degree of diversification benefit the entity includes when determining the compensation it\nrequires for bearing that risk; and  \n(b) both favourable and unfavourable outcomes, in a way that reflects the entity\u2019s degree of risk\naversion.  \nB89 The purpose of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is to measure the effect of uncertainty in the cash\nflows that arise from insurance contracts, other than uncertainty arising from financial risk. Consequently,\nthe risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall reflect all non-financial risks associated with the insurance\ncontracts. It shall not reflect the risks that do not arise from the insurance contracts, such as general\noperational risk.  \nB90 The risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall be included in the measurement in an explicit way. The risk\nadjustment for non-financial risk is conceptually separate from the estimates of future cash flows and the\ndiscount rates that adjust those cash flows. The entity shall not double-count the risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk by, for example, also including the risk adjustment for non-financial risk implicitly when\ndetermining the estimates of future cash flows or the discount rates. The discount rates that are disclosed to\ncomply with paragraph 120 shall not include any implicit adjustments for non-financial risk.  \nB91 AASB 17 does not specify the estimation technique(s) used to determine the risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk. However, to reflect the compensation the entity would require for bearing the non-financial\nrisk, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall have the following characteristics:  \n(a) risks with low frequency and high severity will result in higher risk adjustments for non-financial\nrisk than risks with high frequency and low severity;  \n(b) for similar risks, contracts with a longer duration will result in higher risk adjustments for nonfinancial risk than contracts with a shorter duration;  \n(c) risks with a wider probability distribution will result in higher risk adjustments for non-financial\nrisk than risks with a narrower distribution;  \n(d) the less that is known about the current estimate and its trend, the higher will be the risk\nadjustment for non-financial risk; and  \n(e) to the extent that emerging experience reduces uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash\nflows, risk adjustments for non-financial risk will decrease and vice versa.  \nB92 An entity shall apply judgement when determining an appropriate estimation technique for the risk\nadjustment for non-financial risk. When applying that judgement, an entity shall also consider whether the\ntechnique provides concise and informative disclosure so that users of financial statements can benchmark\nthe entity\u2019s performance against the performance of other entities. Paragraph 119 requires an entity that uses\na technique other than the confidence level technique for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial\nrisk to disclose the technique used and the confidence level corresponding to the results of that technique.  \n-----  ",

These effects comprise:  \n(i) the effect, if any, on estimated future cash flows;  \n(ii) the effect, if disaggregated, on the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and  \n(iii) the effect of a change in discount rate.  \n(b) changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows in the liability for incurred claims.  \n(c) experience adjustments, except those described in paragraph B96(a).  \nB98 The terms of some insurance contracts without direct participation features give an entity discretion over the\ncash flows to be paid to policyholders. A change in the discretionary cash flows is regarded as relating to\nfuture service, and accordingly adjusts the contractual service margin. To determine how to identify a\nchange in discretionary cash flows, an entity shall specify at inception of the contract the basis on which it\nexpects to determine its commitment under the contract; for example, based on a fixed interest rate, or on\nreturns that vary based on specified asset returns.  \nB99 An entity shall use that specification to distinguish between the effect of changes in assumptions that relate\nto financial risk on that commitment (which do not adjust the contractual service margin) and the effect of\ndiscretionary changes to that commitment (which adjust the contractual service margin).  \nB100 If an entity cannot specify at inception of the contract what it regards as its commitment under the contract\nand what it regards as discretionary, it shall regard its commitment to be the return implicit in the estimate\nof the fulfilment cash flows at inception of the contract, updated to reflect current assumptions that relate to\nfinancial risk.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Changes in the carrying amount of the contractual service margin for insurance contracts with direct participation features (paragraph 45)  \nB101 Insurance contracts with direct participation features are insurance contracts that are substantially\ninvestment-related service contracts under which an entity promises an investment return based on\nunderlying items. Hence, they are defined as insurance contracts for which:  \n(a) the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified\npool of underlying items (see paragraphs B105\u2013B106);  \n(b) the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair\nvalue returns on the underlying items (see paragraph B107); and  \n(c) the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the\npolicyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items (see paragraph B107).  \nB102 An entity shall assess whether the conditions in paragraph B101 are met using its expectations at inception\nof the contract and shall not reassess the conditions afterwards, unless the contract is modified, applying\nparagraph 72.  \nB103 To the extent that insurance contracts in a group affect the cash flows to policyholders of contracts in other\ngroups (see paragraphs B67\u2013B71), an entity shall assess whether the conditions in paragraph B101 are met\nby considering the cash flows that the entity expects to pay the policyholders determined applying\nparagraphs B68\u2013B70.  \nB104 The conditions in paragraph B101 ensure that insurance contracts with direct participation features are\ncontracts under which the entity\u2019s obligation to the policyholder is the net of:  \n(a) the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items;\nand  \n(b) a variable fee (see paragraphs B110\u2013B118) that the entity will deduct from (a) in exchange for the\nfuture service provided by the insurance contract, comprising:  \n(i) the amount of the entity\u2019s share of the fair value of the underlying items; less  \n(ii) fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items.  \nB105 A share referred to in paragraph B101(a) does not preclude the existence of the entity\u2019s discretion to vary\nthe amounts paid to the policyholder. However, the link to the underlying items must be enforceable (see\nparagraph 2).  \nB106 The pool of underlying items referred to in paragraph B101(a) can comprise any items, for example a\nreference portfolio of assets, the net assets of the entity, or a specified subset of the net assets of the entity,\nas long as they are clearly identified by the contract. An entity need not hold the identified pool of\nunderlying items. However, a clearly identified pool of underlying items does not exist when:  \n(a) an entity can change the underlying items that determine the amount of the entity\u2019s obligation\nwith retrospective effect; or  \n(b) there are no underlying items identified, even if the policyholder could be provided with a return\nthat generally reflects the entity\u2019s overall performance and expectations, or the performance and\nexpectations of a subset of assets the entity holds. An example of such a return is a crediting rate\nor dividend payment set at the end of the period to which it relates. In this case, the obligation to\nthe policyholder reflects the crediting rate or dividend amounts the entity has set, and does not\nreflect identified underlying items.  \nB107 Paragraph B101(b) requires that the entity expects a substantial share of the fair value returns on the\nunderlying items will be paid to the policyholder and paragraph B101(c) requires that the entity expects a\nsubstantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change\nin fair value of the underlying items. An entity shall:  \n(a) interpret the term \u2018substantial\u2019 in both paragraphs in the context of the objective of insurance\ncontracts with direct participation features being contracts under which the entity provides\ninvestment-related services and is compensated for the services by a fee that is determined by\nreference to the underlying items; and  \n(b) assess the variability in the amounts in paragraphs B101(b) and B101(c):  \n(i) over the duration of the insurance contract; and  \n-----  (ii) on a present value probability-weighted average basis, not a best or worst outcome\nbasis (see paragraphs B37\u2013B38).  \nB108 For example, if the entity expects to pay a substantial share of the fair value returns on underlying items,\nsubject to a guarantee of a minimum return, there will be scenarios in which:  \n(a) the cash flows that the entity expects to pay to the policyholder vary with the changes in the fair\nvalue of the underlying items because the guaranteed return and other cash flows that do not vary\nbased on the returns on underlying items do not exceed the fair value return on the underlying\nitems; and  \n(b) the cash flows that the entity expects to pay to the policyholder do not vary with the changes in\nthe fair value of the underlying items because the guaranteed return and other cash flows that do\nnot vary based on the returns on underlying items exceed the fair value return on the underlying\nitems.  \nThe entity\u2019s assessment of the variability in paragraph B101(c) for this example will reflect a present value\nprobability-weighted average of all these scenarios.  \nB109 Reinsurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held cannot be insurance contracts with direct\nparticipation features for the purposes of AASB 17.  \nB110 For insurance contracts with direct participation features, the contractual service margin is adjusted to\nreflect the variable nature of the fee. Hence, changes in the amounts set out in paragraph B104 are treated as\nset out in paragraphs B111\u2013B114.  \nB111 Changes in the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items\n(paragraph B104(a)) do not relate to future service and do not adjust the contractual service margin.  \nB112 Changes in the amount of the entity\u2019s share of the fair value of the underlying items (paragraph B104(b)(i))\nrelate to future service and adjust the contractual service margin, applying paragraph 45(b).  \nB113 Changes in the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items (paragraph\nB104(b)(ii)) comprise:  \n(a) changes in the fulfilment cash flows other than those specified in (b). An entity shall apply\nparagraphs B96\u2013B97, consistent with insurance contracts without direct participation features, to\ndetermine to what extent they relate to future service and, applying paragraph 45(c), adjust the\ncontractual service margin. All the adjustments are measured using current discount rates.  \n(b) the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the\nunderlying items; for example, the effect of financial guarantees. These relate to future service\nand, applying paragraph 45(c), adjust the contractual service margin, except to the extent that\nparagraph B115 applies.  \nB114 An entity is not required to identify the adjustments to the contractual service margin required by\nparagraphs B112 and B113 separately. Instead, a combined amount may be determined for some or all of\nthe adjustments.  \n_Risk mitigation_  \nB115 To the extent that an entity meets the conditions in paragraph B116, it may choose not to recognise a change\nin the contractual service margin to reflect some or all of the changes in the effect of the time value of\nmoney and financial risk on:  \n(a) the amount of the entity\u2019s share of the underlying items (see paragraph B112) if the entity\nmitigates the effect of financial risk on that amount using derivatives or reinsurance contracts\nheld; and  \n(b) the fulfilment cash flows set out in paragraph B113(b) if the entity mitigates the effect of\nfinancial risk on those fulfilment cash flows using derivatives, non-derivative financial\ninstruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contracts held.  \nB116 To apply paragraph B115, an entity must have a previously documented risk-management objective and\nstrategy for mitigating financial risk as described in paragraph B115. In applying that objective and\nstrategy:  \n(a) an economic offset exists between the insurance contracts and the derivative, non-derivative\nfinancial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contract held (ie\nthe values of the insurance contracts and those risk mitigating items generally move in opposite\ndirections because they respond in a similar way to the changes in the risk being mitigated). An\nentity shall not consider accounting measurement differences in assessing the economic offset.  \n-----  (b) credit risk does not dominate the economic offset.  \nB117 The entity shall determine the fulfilment cash flows in a group to which paragraph B115 applies in a\nconsistent manner in each reporting period.  \nB117A If the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk using derivatives or non-derivative financial instruments\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss, it shall include insurance finance income or expenses for the\nperiod arising from the application of paragraph B115 in profit or loss. If the entity mitigates the effect of\nfinancial risk using reinsurance contracts held, it shall apply the same accounting policy for the presentation\nof insurance finance income or expenses arising from the application of paragraph B115 as the entity\napplies to the reinsurance contracts held applying paragraphs 88 and 90.  \nB118 If, and only if, any of the conditions in paragraph B116 cease to be met an entity shall cease to apply\nparagraph B115 from that date. An entity shall not make any adjustment for changes previously recognised\nin profit or loss.",

        "page_content=": "## Insurance revenue (paragraphs 83 and 85)  \nB120 The total insurance revenue for a group of insurance contracts is the consideration for the contracts, ie the\namount of premiums paid to the entity:  \n(a) adjusted for a financing effect; and  \n(b) excluding any investment components.  \nB121 Paragraph 83 requires the amount of insurance revenue recognised in a period to depict the transfer of\npromised services at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in\nexchange for those services. The total consideration for a group of contracts covers the following amounts:  \n(a) amounts related to the provision of services, comprising:  \n(i) insurance service expenses, excluding any amounts relating to the risk adjustment for\nnon-financial risk included in (ii) and any amounts allocated to the loss component of\nthe liability for remaining coverage;  \n(ia) amounts related to income tax that are specifically chargeable to the policyholder;  \n(ii) the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding any amounts allocated to the loss\ncomponent of the liability for remaining coverage; and  \n(iii) the contractual service margin.  \n(b) amounts related to insurance acquisition cash flows.  \nB122 Insurance revenue for a period relating to the amounts described in paragraph B121(a) is determined as set\nout in paragraphs B123\u2013B124. Insurance revenue for a period relating to the amounts described in\nparagraph B121(b) is determined as set out in paragraph B125.  \nB123 Applying AASB 15, when an entity provides services, it derecognises the performance obligation for those\nservices and recognises revenue. Consistently, applying AASB 17, when an entity provides services in a\nperiod, it reduces the liability for remaining coverage for the services provided and recognises insurance\nrevenue. The reduction in the liability for remaining coverage that gives rise to insurance revenue excludes\nchanges in the liability that do not relate to services expected to be covered by the consideration received by\nthe entity. Those changes are:  \n(a) changes that do not relate to services provided in the period, for example:  \n(i) changes resulting from cash inflows from premiums received;  \n(ii) changes that relate to investment components in the period;  \n(iia) changes resulting from cash flows from loans to policyholders;  \n(iii) changes that relate to transaction-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties (such\nas premium taxes, value added taxes and goods and services taxes) (see\nparagraph B65(i));  \n(iv) insurance finance income or expenses;  \n(v) insurance acquisition cash flows (see paragraph B125); and  \n(vi) derecognition of liabilities transferred to a third party.  \n(b) changes that relate to services, but for which the entity does not expect consideration, ie increases\nand decreases in the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage (see paragraphs 47\u2013\n52).  \nB123A To the extent that an entity derecognises an asset for cash flows other than insurance acquisition cash flows\nat the date of initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts (see paragraphs 38(c)(ii) and B66A), it\nshall recognise insurance revenue and expenses for the amount derecognised at that date.  \nB124 Consequently, insurance revenue for the period can also be analysed as the total of the changes in the\nliability for remaining coverage in the period that relates to services for which the entity expects to receive\nconsideration. Those changes are:  \n-----  (a) insurance service expenses incurred in the period (measured at the amounts expected at the\nbeginning of the period), excluding:  \n(i) amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage\napplying paragraph 51(a);  \n(ii) repayments of investment components;  \n(iii) amounts that relate to transaction-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties (such\nas premium taxes, value added taxes and goods and services taxes) (see paragraph\nB65(i));  \n(iv) insurance acquisition expenses (see paragraph B125); and  \n(v) the amount related to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk (see (b)).  \n(b) the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding:  \n(i) changes included in insurance finance income or expenses applying paragraph 87;  \n(ii) changes that adjust the contractual service margin because they relate to future service\napplying paragraphs 44(c) and 45(c); and  \n(iii) amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage\napplying paragraph 51(b).  \n(c) the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss in the period, applying\nparagraphs 44(e) and 45(e).  \n(d) other amounts, if any, for example, experience adjustments for premium receipts other than those\nthat relate to future service (see paragraph B96(a)).  \nB125 An entity shall determine insurance revenue related to insurance acquisition cash flows by allocating the\nportion of the premiums that relate to recovering those cash flows to each reporting period in a systematic\nway on the basis of the passage of time. An entity shall recognise the same amount as insurance service\nexpenses.  \nB126 When an entity applies the premium allocation approach in paragraphs 55\u201358, insurance revenue for the\nperiod is the amount of expected premium receipts (excluding any investment component and adjusted to\nreflect the time value of money and the effect of financial risk, if applicable, applying paragraph 56)\nallocated to the period. The entity shall allocate the expected premium receipts to each period of insurance\ncontract services:  \n(a) on the basis of the passage of time; but  \n(b) if the expected pattern of release of risk during the coverage period differs significantly from the\npassage of time, then on the basis of the expected timing of incurred insurance service expenses.  \nB127 An entity shall change the basis of allocation between paragraphs B126(a) and B126(b) as necessary if facts\nand circumstances change.",

For the purposes of AASB 17:  \n(a) assumptions about inflation based on an index of prices or rates or on prices of assets with\ninflation-linked returns are assumptions that relate to financial risk;  \n(b) assumptions about inflation based on an entity\u2019s expectation of specific price changes are not\nassumptions that relate to financial risk; and  \n(c) changes in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts caused by changes in the value of\nunderlying items (excluding additions and withdrawals) are changes arising from the effect of the\ntime value of money and financial risk and changes therein.  \nB129 Paragraphs 88\u201389 require an entity to make an accounting policy choice as to whether to disaggregate\ninsurance finance income or expenses for the period between profit or loss and other comprehensive\nincome. An entity shall apply its choice of accounting policy to portfolios of insurance contracts. In\nassessing the appropriate accounting policy for a portfolio of insurance contracts, applying paragraph 13 of\nAASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the entity shall consider for\neach portfolio the assets that the entity holds and how it accounts for those assets.  \n-----  B130 If paragraph 88(b) applies, an entity shall include in profit or loss an amount determined by a systematic\nallocation of the expected total finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of insurance\ncontracts. In this context, a systematic allocation is an allocation of the total expected finance income or\nexpenses of a group of insurance contracts over the duration of the group that:  \n(a) is based on characteristics of the contracts, without reference to factors that do not affect the cash\nflows expected to arise under the contracts. For example, the allocation of the finance income or\nexpenses shall not be based on expected recognised returns on assets if those expected recognised\nreturns do not affect the cash flows of the contracts in the group.  \n(b) results in the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income over the duration of the group\nof contracts totalling zero. The cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income at\nany date is the difference between the carrying amount of the group of contracts and the amount\nthat the group would be measured at when applying the systematic allocation.  \nB131 For groups of insurance contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk do not have\na substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholder, the systematic allocation is determined using\nthe discount rates specified in paragraph B72(e)(i).  \nB132 For groups of insurance contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk have a\nsubstantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholders:  \n(a) a systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the estimates of future\ncash flows can be determined in one of the following ways:  \n(i) using a rate that allocates the remaining revised expected finance income or expenses\nover the remaining duration of the group of contracts at a constant rate; or  \n(ii) for contracts that use a crediting rate to determine amounts due to the policyholders \u2013\nusing an allocation that is based on the amounts credited in the period and expected to\nbe credited in future periods.  \n(b) a systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the risk adjustment for\nnon-financial risk, if separately disaggregated from other changes in the risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk applying paragraph 81, is determined using an allocation consistent with that used\nfor the allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the future cash flows.  \n(c) a systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the contractual service\nmargin is determined:  \n(i) for insurance contracts that do not have direct participation features, using the discount\nrates specified in paragraph B72(b); and  \n(ii) for insurance contracts with direct participation features, using an allocation consistent\nwith that used for the allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the\nfuture cash flows.  \nB133 In applying the premium allocation approach to insurance contracts described in paragraphs 53\u201359, an\nentity may be required, or may choose, to discount the liability for incurred claims. In such cases, it may\nchoose to disaggregate the insurance finance income or expenses applying paragraph 88(b). If the entity\nmakes this choice, it shall determine the insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss using the\ndiscount rate specified in paragraph B72(e)(iii).  \nB134 Paragraph 89 applies if an entity, either by choice or because it is required to, holds the underlying items for\ninsurance contracts with direct participation features. If an entity chooses to disaggregate insurance finance\nincome or expenses applying paragraph 89(b), it shall include in profit or loss expenses or income that\nexactly match the income or expenses included in profit or loss for the underlying items, resulting in the net\nof the separately presented items being nil.  \nB135 An entity may qualify for the accounting policy choice in paragraph 89 in some periods but not in others\nbecause of a change in whether it holds the underlying items. If such a change occurs, the accounting policy\nchoice available to the entity changes from that set out in paragraph 88 to that set out in paragraph 89, or\nvice versa. Hence, an entity might change its accounting policy between that set out in paragraph 88(b) and\nthat set out in paragraph 89(b). In making such a change an entity shall:  \n(a) include the accumulated amount previously included in other comprehensive income by the date\nof the change as a reclassification adjustment in profit or loss in the period of change and in\nfuture periods, as follows:  \n(i) if the entity had previously applied paragraph 88(b) \u2013 the entity shall include in profit\nor loss the accumulated amount included in other comprehensive income before the  \n-----  change as if the entity were continuing the approach in paragraph 88(b) based on the\nassumptions that applied immediately before the change; and  \n(ii) if the entity had previously applied paragraph 89(b) \u2013 the entity shall include in profit\nor loss the accumulated amount included in other comprehensive income before the\nchange as if the entity were continuing the approach in paragraph 89(b) based on the\nassumptions that applied immediately before the change.  \n(b) not restate prior period comparative information.  \nB136 When applying paragraph B135(a), an entity shall not recalculate the accumulated amount previously\nincluded in other comprehensive income as if the new disaggregation had always applied; and the\nassumptions used for the reclassification in future periods shall not be updated after the date of the change.",

The cash flows that are\nknown to have occurred include cash flows resulting from contracts that ceased to exist before the transition\ndate.  \nC13 To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall determine the discount rates that applied at the date\nof initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts (or subsequently):  \n(a) using an observable yield curve that, for at least three years immediately before the transition\ndate, approximates the yield curve estimated applying paragraphs 36 and B72\u2013B85, if such an\nobservable yield curve exists.  \n(b) if the observable yield curve in paragraph (a) does not exist, estimate the discount rates that\napplied at the date of initial recognition (or subsequently) by determining an average spread\nbetween an observable yield curve and the yield curve estimated applying paragraphs 36 and\nB72\u2013B85, and applying that spread to that observable yield curve. That spread shall be an\naverage over at least three years immediately before the transition date.  \nC14 To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall determine the risk adjustment for non-financial risk\nat the date of initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts (or subsequently) by adjusting the risk\nadjustment for non-financial risk at the transition date by the expected release of risk before the transition\ndate. The expected release of risk shall be determined by reference to the release of risk for similar\ninsurance contracts that the entity issues at the transition date.  \nC14A Applying paragraph B137, an entity may choose not to change the treatment of accounting estimates made\nin previous interim financial statements. To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, such an entity shall\ndetermine the contractual service margin or loss component at the transition date as if the entity had not\nprepared interim financial statements before the transition date.  \nC14B To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall use the same systematic and rational method the\nentity expects to use after the transition date when applying paragraph 28A to allocate any insurance\nacquisition cash flows paid (or for which a liability has been recognised applying another Australian\nAccounting Standard) before the transition date (excluding any amount relating to insurance contracts that\nceased to exist before the transition date) to:  \n(a) groups of insurance contracts that are recognised at the transition date; and  \n(b) groups of insurance contracts that are expected to be recognised after the transition date.  \nC14C Insurance acquisition cash flows paid before the transition date that are allocated to a group of insurance\ncontracts recognised at the transition date adjust the contractual service margin of that group, to the extent\ninsurance contracts expected to be in the group have been recognised at that date (see paragraphs 28C and\nB35C). Other insurance acquisition cash flows paid before the transition date, including those allocated to a\ngroup of insurance contracts expected to be recognised after the transition date, are recognised as an asset,\napplying paragraph 28B.  \nC14D If an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply paragraph C14B, the entity shall\ndetermine the following amounts to be nil at the transition date:  \n(a) the adjustment to the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts recognised at\nthe transition date and any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows relating to that group; and  \n(b) the asset for insurance acquisition cash flows for groups of insurance contracts expected to be\nrecognised after the transition date.  \nC15 If applying paragraphs C12\u2013C14D results in a contractual service margin at the date of initial recognition,\nto determine the contractual service margin at the date of transition an entity shall:  \n(a) if the entity applies C13 to estimate the discount rates that apply on initial recognition, use those\nrates to accrete interest on the contractual service margin; and  \n(b) to the extent permitted by paragraph C8, determine the amount of the contractual service margin\nrecognised in profit or loss because of the transfer of services before the transition date, by\ncomparing the remaining coverage units at that date with the coverage units provided under the\ngroup of contracts before the transition date (see paragraph B119).  \nC16 If applying paragraphs C12\u2013C14D results in a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the\ndate of initial recognition, an entity shall determine any amounts allocated to the loss component before the\ntransition date applying paragraphs C12\u2013C14D and using a systematic basis of allocation.  \n-----  C16A For a group of reinsurance contracts held that provides coverage for an onerous group of insurance contracts\nand was entered into before or at the same time that the insurance contracts were issued, an entity shall\nestablish a loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining coverage at the transition date (see\nparagraphs 66A\u201366B). To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall determine the loss-recovery\ncomponent by multiplying:  \n(a) the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage for the underlying insurance contracts\nat the transition date (see paragraphs C16 and C20); and  \n(b) the percentage of claims for the underlying insurance contracts the entity expects to recover from\nthe group of reinsurance contracts held.  \nC16B Applying paragraphs 14\u201222, at the transition date an entity might include in an onerous group of insurance\ncontracts both onerous insurance contracts covered by a group of reinsurance contracts held and onerous\ninsurance contracts not covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held. To apply paragraph C16A in\nsuch cases, an entity shall use a systematic and rational basis of allocation to determine the portion of the\nloss component of the group of insurance contracts that relates to insurance contracts covered by the group\nof reinsurance contracts held.  \nC16C If an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply paragraph C16A, the entity shall\nnot identify a loss-recovery component for the group of reinsurance contracts held.  \n**Determining the contractual service margin or loss component for groups of**\n**insurance contracts with direct participation features**  \nC17 To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, for contracts with direct participation features an entity shall\ndetermine the contractual service margin or loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the\ntransition date as:  \n(a) the total fair value of the underlying items at that date; minus  \n(b) the fulfilment cash flows at that date; plus or minus  \n(c) an adjustment for:  \n(i) amounts charged by the entity to the policyholders (including amounts deducted from\nthe underlying items) before that date.  \n(ii) amounts paid before that date that would not have varied based on the underlying\nitems.  \n(iii) the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk caused by the release from risk\nbefore that date. The entity shall estimate this amount by reference to the release of risk\nfor similar insurance contracts that the entity issues at the transition date.  \n(iv) insurance acquisition cash flows paid (or for which a liability has been recognised\napplying another Australian Accounting Standard) before the transition date that are\nallocated to the group (see paragraph C17A).  \n(d) if (a)\u2013(c) result in a contractual service margin \u2013 minus the amount of the contractual service\nmargin that relates to services provided before that date. The total of (a)\u2013(c) is a proxy for the\ntotal contractual service margin for all services to be provided under the group of contracts, ie\nbefore any amounts that would have been recognised in profit or loss for services provided. The\nentity shall estimate the amounts that would have been recognised in profit or loss for services\nprovided by comparing the remaining coverage units at the transition date with the coverage units\nprovided under the group of contracts before the transition date; or  \n(e) if (a)\u2013(c) result in a loss component \u2013 adjust the loss component to nil and increase the liability\nfor remaining coverage excluding the loss component by the same amount.  \nC17A To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall apply paragraphs C14B\u2012C14D to recognise an\nasset for insurance acquisition cash flows, and any adjustment to the contractual service margin of a group\nof insurance contracts with direct participation features for insurance acquisition cash flows (see paragraph\nC17(c)(iv)).",

Otherwise, any such amounts shall be reversed._  \nC28D Any difference between the previous carrying amount of a financial asset and the carrying amount at the\ntransition date that results from applying paragraphs C28B\u2013C28C shall be recognised in opening retained\nearnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the transition date.  \nC28E An entity that applies paragraphs C28B\u2013C28D shall:  \n(a) disclose qualitative information that enables users of financial statements to understand:  \n(i) the extent to which the classification overlay has been applied (for example, whether it\nhas been applied to all financial assets derecognised in the comparative period);  \n(ii) whether and to what extent the impairment requirements in Section 5.5 of AASB 9\nhave been applied (see paragraph C28C);  \n(b) only apply those paragraphs to comparative information for reporting periods between the\ntransition date to AASB 17 and the date of initial application of AASB 17 (see paragraphs C2 and\nC25); and  \n(c) at the date of initial application of AASB 9, apply the transition requirements in AASB 9 (see\nSection 7.2 of AASB 9).",

A financial asset is eligible only if the financial asset is not held\nin respect of an activity that is unconnected with contracts within the scope of AASB 17.\nExamples of financial assets that would not be eligible for reassessment are financial assets held\nin respect of banking activities or financial assets held in funds relating to investment contracts\nthat are outside the scope of AASB 17.  \n(b) shall revoke its previous designation of a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit\nor loss if the condition in paragraph 4.1.5 of AASB 9 is no longer met because of the application\nof AASB 17.  \n(c) may designate a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or loss if the condition in\nparagraph 4.1.5 of AASB 9 is met.  \n(d) may designate an investment in an equity instrument as at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome applying paragraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9.  \n(e) may revoke its previous designation of an investment in an equity instrument as at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income applying paragraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9.  \nC30 An entity shall apply paragraph C29 on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of\ninitial application of AASB 17. An entity shall apply those designations and classifications retrospectively.\nIn doing so, the entity shall apply the relevant transition requirements in AASB 9. The date of initial\napplication for that purpose shall be deemed to be the date of initial application of AASB 17.  \nC31 An entity that applies paragraph C29 is not required to restate prior periods to reflect such changes in\ndesignations or classifications. The entity may restate prior periods only if it is possible without the use of\nhindsight. If an entity restates prior periods, the restated financial statements must reflect all the\nrequirements of AASB 9 for those affected financial assets.

If those contracts are not within  \n-----  the scope of AASB 4 AASB 17 Insurance Contracts or AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts, they are\nwithin the scope of this Standard.  \n\u2026  \nB2.4 This Standard applies to the financial assets and financial liabilities of insurers, other than rights and\nobligations that paragraph 2.1(e) excludes because they arise under contracts within the scope of AASB 4\nAASB 17.  \nB2.5 Financial guarantee contracts may have various legal forms, such as a guarantee, some types of letter of\ncredit, a credit default contract or an insurance contract. Their accounting treatment does not depend on\ntheir legal form. The following are examples of the appropriate treatment (see paragraph 2.1(e)):  \n(a) Although a financial guarantee contract meets the definition of an insurance contract in AASB 4\nAASB 17 (see paragraph 7(e) of AASB 17) if the risk transferred is significant, the issuer applies\nthis Standard. Nevertheless, if the issuer has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such\ncontracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting that is applicable to insurance contracts,\nthe issuer may elect to apply either this Standard or AASB 1023 AASB 17 to such financial\nguarantee contracts. ...  \n(b) Some credit-related guarantees do not, as a precondition for payment, require that the holder is\nexposed to, and has incurred a loss on, the failure of the debtor to make payments on the\nguaranteed asset when due. An example of such a guarantee is one that requires payments in\nresponse to changes in a specified credit rating or credit index. Such guarantees are not financial\nguarantee contracts as defined in this Standard, and are not insurance contracts as defined in\nAASB 4 AASB 17. Such guarantees are derivatives and the issuer applies this Standard to them.  \n(c) \u2026",

In\nthe Australian context, those national accounting requirements (including Reduced Disclosure\nRequirements (RDR) concessions) were contained in:  \n(a) AASB 4 Insurance Contracts;  \n(b) AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts;  \n(c) AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts; and  \n(d) Interpretation 1047 _Professional Indemnity Claims Liabilities in Medical Defence_\n_Organisations._  \nAusBC3 In addition, AASB 1056 Superannuation Entities includes requirements applicable to a superannuation\nentity acting in the capacity of an insurer.  \nAusBC4 IFRS 17 was developed by the IASB from a for-profit perspective. Accordingly, and consistent with\nthe AASB\u2019s _Process for Modifying IFRSs for PBE/NFP, the AASB considered whether it would be_\nsuitable for not-for-profit (NFP) entities.  \nAusBC5 Within the context of replacing existing Australian requirements and addressing NFP issues,\nAustralian-specific issues that are the subject of this Basis for Conclusions relate to the implications\nfor:  \n(a) AASB 4, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 (including Australian-specific disclosure\nrequirements) \u2013 see paragraphs AusBC6\u2013AusBC11;  \n(b) Interpretation 1047 \u2013 see paragraphs AusBC14\u2013AusBC17;  \n(c) AASB 1056 \u2013 see paragraphs AusBC18\u2013AusBC22;  \n(d) NFP and public sector entities (including for-profit public sector entities) \u2013 see paragraphs\nAusBC23\u2013AusBC30; and  \n(e) RDR \u2013 see paragraphs AusBC31\u2013AusBC32.  \nSome of these issues have been resolved through the issue of AASB 17, others will be the subject of\nfurther due process (including in a forthcoming ED on Australian-specific issues arising from\nAASB 17), as noted where relevant below.",

        "page_content=": "## Implications for AASB 4, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038  \nAusBC6 The AASB noted that adopting IFRS 17 would supersede AASB 4, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 and\ntherefore change current accounting requirements for insurance contracts. The AASB acknowledged\nthat doing so would improve financial reporting in some respects but not in other respects.  \nAusBC7 Regarding the key aspects, the AASB noted that:  \n(a) the main improvements include:  \n(i) greater clarity around the accounting for acquisition costs, particularly for general\ninsurance; and  \n-----  (ii) greater alignment with other industries of the basis for revenue recognition for\ninsurance contracts with coverage periods greater than one year; and  \n(b) the main areas not improved include:  \n(i) use of historical (inception-date) discount rates in accounting for the contractual\nservice margin (CSM) under the \u2018general model\u2019;  \n(ii) use of \u2018coverage period\u2019 (rather than pattern of service provision) as the basis for\nrecognising the CSM in profit over the contract life; and  \n(iii) the level of aggregation of contracts for accounting purposes.  \nAusBC8 In weighing up these issues, the AASB also acknowledged the precedent it established when it decided\nnot to adopt IAS 26 Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans in favour of retaining the\nAustralian accounting requirements specified in AAS 25 _Financial Reporting by Superannuation_\n_Plans. This decision was subsequently reconfirmed when the AASB issued AASB 1056 to supersede_\nAAS 25.  \nAusBC9 In considering the facts and circumstances surrounding the AASB\u2019s decisions not to adopt IAS 26 (and\nthereby have an exception to its IFRS adoption policy), the AASB concluded that the legislative\nenvironment as well as tailored financial reporting requirements for superannuation entities (which\nwere not adequately addressed in IAS 26) justified the need for a specific Australian pronouncement\n(see paragraphs BC7\u2013BC11 of AASB 1056). In contrast, overall, the AASB concluded that IFRS 17\nrepresents a comprehensive, internationally consistent, set of financial reporting requirements for\nAustralian insurers, despite the issues noted in paragraph AusBC7(b).  \nAusBC10 On balance, the AASB considered that the benefits arising from international harmonisation in relation\nto the accounting for insurance contracts, and the greater alignment of the basis for revenue\nrecognition with other industries noted in paragraph AusBC7(a)(ii), outweighed the drawbacks noted\nin paragraph AusBC7(b). Accordingly, the AASB decided to supersede AASB 4, AASB 1023 and\nAASB 1038 (and Interpretation 1047 \u2013 see paragraphs AusBC14\u2013AusBC17) for for-profit private\nsector entities with the issue of AASB 17. NFP private sector entities and public sector entities are\ndiscussed in paragraphs AusBC23\u2013AusBC30.  \nAusBC11 The AASB noted that a consequence of its decision to supersede AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 is that\nAustralian specific disclosures (eg paragraphs 17.8 and 17.10(c) of AASB 1038 relating to regulatory\ncapital disclosures and conformance with the _Life Insurance Act 1995) are no longer required._\nHowever, as a separate project the AASB intends to review the usefulness and necessity of those\ndisclosures under AASB 17 at a future date prior to AASB 17 becoming mandatory.  \nAusBC12 The AASB further considered the interaction between AASB 4, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038, noting\nthat compliance with either AASB 1023 or AASB 1038 simultaneously achieved compliance with\nAASB 4. However, the AASB observed that this fact was not explicitly stated in AASB 4 itself,\nwhich resulted in divergent interpretations of whether an insurer could apply either of the AASB 9\n_Financial Instruments deferral or overlay approaches introduced with AASB 2016-6_ _Amendments to_\n_Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Applying AASB 9_ Financial Instruments _with AASB 4_ Insurance\nContracts.  \nAusBC13 The AASB decided to clarify paragraph Aus3.1 and insert paragraph Aus3.2 in AASB 4 to replicate\nsimilar wording already present in AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 to highlight the simultaneous\ncompliance noted above. Furthermore, the AASB decided to clearly indicate that liabilities in scope of\nAASB 1023 and AASB 1038 are included in an insurer\u2019s consideration of whether it qualifies for\neither the deferral or overlay approaches. The AASB noted that these amendments are purely\nmechanical and for clarification only, expecting no change in practice arising from these amendments.",

        "page_content=": "## Implications for Interpretation 1047  \nAusBC14 Interpretation 1047 was originally issued in June 2002 to address divergent views as to whether a\nMedical Defence Organisation (MDO) should recognise a liability for future claims arising from the\nmedical indemnity insurance it offered given the MDO had discretion on whether to pay claims made\nby members. The Interpretation required that a MDO recognise its obligations in a manner consistent\nwith the principles in AASB 1023.  \nAusBC15 After 1 July 2003, the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002 came into effect and regulatory arrangements_\nallowed only authorised general insurers to offer medical indemnity insurance. In August 2016 the\nAASB noted feedback from staff outreach to industry stakeholders indicating that all medical  \n-----  indemnity insurance had, as of then, been transferred to authorised general insurers (or subsidiaries\nthereof).  \nAusBC16 Also at its August 2016 meeting, the AASB noted that some business written by MDOs prior to 1 July\n2003 could still be in existence, and therefore might still require the guidance of Interpretation 1047.\nHowever, on balance, based on the feedback from staff outreach to industry stakeholders, the AASB\nconcluded that any such remaining business would be immaterial to the financial statements of the\naffected insurers.  \nAusBC17 Accordingly, the AASB decided to supersede Interpretation 1047 for for-profit private sector entities\nupon the adoption of IFRS 17 given it was no longer materially relevant, could result in a perceived\n\u2018difference\u2019 from IFRS if retained and no longer reflected predominant current practice.

        "page_content=": "## Implications for AASB 1056 Superannuation Entities  \nAusBC18 The AASB issued Exposure Draft ED 223 _Superannuation Entities_ (December 2011) proposing new\naccounting requirements for superannuation entities as part of the AASB\u2019s comprehensive review of\nAAS 25. ED 223 proposed that superannuation entities must measure any liabilities arising from\ninsurance arrangements provided to members in accordance with the approach in AASB 119 Employee\n_Benefits for defined benefit plans._  \nAusBC19 The AASB issued AASB 1056 in June 2014 instead requiring that superannuation entities apply the\ndefined benefit member liability measurement requirements of AASB 1056, as opposed to AASB 119,\nin response to feedback received on ED 223.  \nAusBC20 When issuing AASB 17 the AASB was aware that a superannuation entity acting in the capacity of an\ninsurer would apply the insurance requirements of AASB 1056 and not those of AASB 17 because\nAASB 1056 effectively overrides AASB 17 for a superannuation entity acting in the capacity of an\ninsurer. The AASB noted this would mean superannuation entities could not claim compliance with\nIFRS. However, the AASB noted that superannuation entities could not claim IFRS compliance\nanyway because AASB 1056 does not incorporate the corresponding IASB Standard. Accordingly,\nthe AASB decided that no amendments were necessary to the insurance requirements of AASB 1056\nas IFRS compliance is not an objective in this limited circumstance. For the avoidance of doubt, the\nAASB also decided to prevent superannuation entities from applying AASB 17 through an amendment\nto AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards. Consequently, the AASB deleted a\ncross-reference to IAS 26 from paragraph 7(b) of AASB 17 instead of replacing it with a crossreference to AASB 1056.  \nAusBC21 The AASB also considered groups where the consolidated financial statements of a superannuation\nentity include an insurance subsidiary that applies AASB 17. On this issue the AASB noted that no\nsignificant issues were brought to its attention during the development of either AASB 1056 or\nAASB 17, nor since.  \nAusBC22 Accordingly, the AASB decided to issue AASB 17 without any consequential amendments to the\ninsurance requirements of AASB 1056 in relation to this matter. However, the AASB decided that it\nwould add a specific matter for comment on this matter to its forthcoming ED on Australian-specific\nissues arising from AASB 17.",

        "page_content=": "## Implications for NFP and public sector entities  \nAusBC23 When issuing a new accounting Standard the AASB considers the applicability of that Standard to all\nsectors of the economy. In the case of AASB 17, the incorporation of IFRS 17 means that the forprofit private sector is largely considered through the IASB\u2019s due process \u2013 see paragraphs AusBC6\u2013\nAusBC11.  \nAusBC24 However, the IASB does not explicitly consider:  \n(a) NFP entities in the public and private sectors; and  \n(b) for-profit entities in the public sector.  \nAusBC25 The AASB decided that additional consideration is warranted for such entities. To that end, the AASB\nestablished a short-term project to consider the applicability and suitability of AASB 17 to them.  \nAusBC26 At the time of issuing AASB 17, that project was in the process of developing proposals for exposure\nin the AASB\u2019s forthcoming ED on Australian-specific issues arising from AASB 17.  \n-----  AusBC27 Notwithstanding the above project, the AASB was aware of key concerns from the NFP public sector\nin particular that need further consideration before a decision is made about whether those entities\nshould be subject to AASB 17 without amendment. Chiefly among those concerns was AASB 17\napplicability to statutory obligations such as Medicare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme or\nworker\u2019s compensation insurance.  \nAusBC28 The AASB acknowledged those concerns and decided to temporarily exclude NFP public sector\nentities from the scope of AASB 17 pending the outcome of its separate project to address these issues.\nUntil such time as the NFP public sector issues are addressed, those affected entities continue to be\nsubject to AASB 4, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 (and, potentially, Interpretation 1047).  \nAusBC29 The AASB noted that NFP private sector entities (eg some health insurers) often enter into insurance\ncontracts that are substantively similar to those entered into by for-profit entities. Accordingly, the\nAASB decided not to restrict NFP private sector entities from applying AASB 17, rather allowing\nthose entities to decide to apply AASB 17 prior to 1 January 2021. However, the AASB may propose\nadditional application guidance, where necessary, as part of the forthcoming ED on Australian-specific\nissues arising from AASB 17, the aim of which is to be operative before the mandatory application\ndate of AASB 17.  \nAusBC30 The AASB also noted that for-profit public sector entities could enter into arrangements that exhibit\ncharacteristics of insurance contracts but are entered into through legislative means as opposed to\ncontractual means. These types of arrangements will also be considered in the AASB\u2019s forthcoming\nED on Australian-specific issues. However, for-profit public sector entities are not prohibited from\napplying AASB 17 as their not-for-profit counterparts are.",
