        "page_content=": "### Puttable instruments\n16A A puttable financial instrument includes a contractual obligation for the issuer to repurchase or redeem that\ninstrument for cash or another financial asset on exercise of the put. As an exception to the definition of a\nfinancial liability, an instrument that includes such an obligation is classified as an equity instrument if it\nhas all the following features:  \n(a) It entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the entity\u2019s net assets in the event of the entity\u2019s\nliquidation. The entity\u2019s net assets are those assets that remain after deducting all other claims on\nits assets. A pro rata share is determined by:  \n(i) dividing the entity\u2019s net assets on liquidation into units of equal amount; and  \n(ii) multiplying that amount by the number of the units held by the financial instrument\nholder.  \n(b) The instrument is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.\nTo be in such a class the instrument:  \n(i) has no priority over other claims to the assets of the entity on liquidation, and  \n(ii) does not need to be converted into another instrument before it is in the class of\ninstruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.  \n(c) All financial instruments in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of\ninstruments have identical features. For example, they must all be puttable, and the formula or\nother method used to calculate the repurchase or redemption price is the same for all instruments\nin that class.  \n(d) Apart from the contractual obligation for the issuer to repurchase or redeem the instrument for\ncash or another financial asset, the instrument does not include any contractual obligation to\ndeliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or\nfinancial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the\nentity, and it is not a contract that will or may be settled in the entity\u2019s own equity instruments as\nset out in subparagraph (b) of the definition of a financial liability.  \n-----  (e) The total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument over the life of the instrument are\nbased substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in\nthe fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity over the life of the\ninstrument (excluding any effects of the instrument).  \n16B For an instrument to be classified as an equity instrument, in addition to the instrument having all the above\nfeatures, the issuer must have no other financial instrument or contract that has:  \n(a) total cash flows based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or\nthe change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity (excluding\nany effects of such instrument or contract) and  \n(b) the effect of substantially restricting or fixing the residual return to the puttable instrument\nholders.  \nFor the purposes of applying this condition, the entity shall not consider non-financial contracts with a\nholder of an instrument described in paragraph 16A that have contractual terms and conditions that are\nsimilar to the contractual terms and conditions of an equivalent contract that might occur between a noninstrument holder and the issuing entity. If the entity cannot determine that this condition is met, it shall not\nclassify the puttable instrument as an equity instrument.  \n**Instruments, or components of instruments, that impose on the entity an**\n**obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the**\n**entity only on liquidation**  \n16C Some financial instruments include a contractual obligation for the issuing entity to deliver to another entity\na pro rata share of its net assets only on liquidation. The obligation arises because liquidation either is\ncertain to occur and outside the control of the entity (for example, a limited life entity) or is uncertain to\noccur but is at the option of the instrument holder. As an exception to the definition of a financial liability,\nan instrument that includes such an obligation is classified as an equity instrument if it has all the following\nfeatures:  \n(a) It entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the entity\u2019s net assets in the event of the entity\u2019s\nliquidation. The entity\u2019s net assets are those assets that remain after deducting all other claims on\nits assets. A pro rata share is determined by:  \n(i) dividing the net assets of the entity on liquidation into units of equal amount; and  \n(ii) multiplying that amount by the number of the units held by the financial instrument\nholder.  \n(b) The instrument is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.\nTo be in such a class the instrument:  \n(i) has no priority over other claims to the assets of the entity on liquidation, and  \n(ii) does not need to be converted into another instrument before it is in the class of\ninstruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.  \n(c) All financial instruments in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of\ninstruments must have an identical contractual obligation for the issuing entity to deliver a pro\nrata share of its net assets on liquidation.  \n16D For an instrument to be classified as an equity instrument, in addition to the instrument having all the above\nfeatures, the issuer must have no other financial instrument or contract that has:  \n(a) total cash flows based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or\nthe change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity (excluding\nany effects of such instrument or contract) and  \n(b) the effect of substantially restricting or fixing the residual return to the instrument holders.  \nFor the purposes of applying this condition, the entity shall not consider non-financial contracts with a\nholder of an instrument described in paragraph 16C that have contractual terms and conditions that are\nsimilar to the contractual terms and conditions of an equivalent contract that might occur between a noninstrument holder and the issuing entity. If the entity cannot determine that this condition is met, it shall not\nclassify the instrument as an equity instrument.  \n-----  **Reclassification of puttable instruments and instruments that impose on the**\n**entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net**\n**assets of the entity only on liquidation**  \n16E An entity shall classify a financial instrument as an equity instrument in accordance with paragraphs 16A\nand 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D from the date when the instrument has all the features and meets the\nconditions set out in those paragraphs. An entity shall reclassify a financial instrument from the date when\nthe instrument ceases to have all the features or meet all the conditions set out in those paragraphs. For\nexample, if an entity redeems all its issued non-puttable instruments and any puttable instrument that remain\noutstanding have all the features and meet all the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B, the entity shall\nreclassify the puttable instruments as equity instruments from the date when it redeems the non-puttable\ninstruments.  \n16F An entity shall account as follows for the reclassification of an instrument in accordance with paragraph\n16E:  \n(a) It shall reclassify an equity instrument as a financial liability from the date when the instrument\nceases to have all the features or meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs\n16C and 16D. The financial liability shall be measured at the instrument\u2019s fair value at the date of\nreclassification. The entity shall recognise in equity any difference between the carrying value of\nthe equity instrument and the fair value of the financial liability at the date of reclassification.  \n(b) It shall reclassify a financial liability as equity from the date when the instrument has all the\nfeatures and meets the conditions set out in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.\nAn equity instrument shall be measured at the carrying value of the financial liability at the date\nof reclassification.  \n**No contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset**\n**(paragraph 16(a))**  \n17 With the exception of the circumstances described in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D,\na critical feature in differentiating a financial liability from an equity instrument is the existence of a\ncontractual obligation of one party to the financial instrument (the issuer) either to deliver cash or another\nfinancial asset to the other party (the holder) or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the\nholder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer. Although the holder of an equity\ninstrument may be entitled to receive a pro rata share of any dividends or other distributions of equity, the\nissuer does not have a contractual obligation to make such distributions because it cannot be required to\ndeliver cash or another financial asset to another party.  \n18 The substance of a financial instrument, rather than its legal form, governs its classification in the entity\u2019s\nstatement of financial position. Substance and legal form are commonly consistent, but not always. Some\nfinancial instruments take the legal form of equity but are liabilities in substance and others may combine\nfeatures associated with equity instruments and features associated with financial liabilities. For example:  \n(a) a preference share that provides for mandatory redemption by the issuer for a fixed or\ndeterminable amount at a fixed or determinable future date, or gives the holder the right to require\nthe issuer to redeem the instrument at or after a particular date for a fixed or determinable\namount, is a financial liability.  \n(b) a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put it back to the issuer for cash or another\nfinancial asset (a \u2018puttable instrument\u2019) is a financial liability, except for those instruments\nclassified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C\nand 16D. The financial instrument is a financial liability even when the amount of cash or other\nfinancial assets is determined on the basis of an index or other item that has the potential to\nincrease or decrease. The existence of an option for the holder to put the instrument back to the\nissuer for cash or another financial asset means that the puttable instrument meets the definition\nof a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance\nwith paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D. For example, open-ended mutual\nfunds, unit trusts, partnerships and some co-operative entities may provide their unitholders or\nmembers with a right to redeem their interests in the issuer at any time for cash, which results in\nthe unitholders\u2019 or members\u2019 interests being classified as financial liabilities, except for those\ninstruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or\nparagraphs 16C and 16D. However, classification as a financial liability does not preclude the use\nof descriptors such as \u2018net asset value attributable to unitholders\u2019 and \u2018change in net asset value\nattributable to unitholders\u2019 in the financial statements of an entity that has no contributed equity\n(such as some mutual funds and unit trusts, see Illustrative Example 7) or the use of additional  \n-----  disclosure to show that total members\u2019 interests comprise items such as reserves that meet the\ndefinition of equity and puttable instruments that do not (see Illustrative Example 8).  \n19 If an entity does not have an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle\na contractual obligation, the obligation meets the definition of a financial liability, except for those\ninstruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C\nand 16D. For example:  \n(a) a restriction on the ability of an entity to satisfy a contractual obligation, such as lack of access to\nforeign currency or the need to obtain approval for payment from a regulatory authority, does not\nnegate the entity\u2019s contractual obligation or the holder\u2019s contractual right under the instrument.  \n(b) a contractual obligation that is conditional on a counterparty exercising its right to redeem is a\nfinancial liability because the entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash\nor another financial asset.  \n20 A financial instrument that does not explicitly establish a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another\nfinancial asset may establish an obligation indirectly through its terms and conditions. For example:  \n(a) a financial instrument may contain a non-financial obligation that must be settled if, and only if,\nthe entity fails to make distributions or to redeem the instrument. If the entity can avoid a transfer\nof cash or another financial asset only by settling the non-financial obligation, the financial\ninstrument is a financial liability.  \n(b) a financial instrument is a financial liability if it provides that on settlement the entity will deliver\neither:  \n(i) cash or another financial asset; or  \n(ii) its own shares whose value is determined to exceed substantially the value of the cash\nor other financial asset.  \nAlthough the entity does not have an explicit contractual obligation to deliver cash or another\nfinancial asset, the value of the share settlement alternative is such that the entity will settle in\ncash. In any event, the holder has in substance been guaranteed receipt of an amount that is at\nleast equal to the cash settlement option (see paragraph 21).",

        "page_content=": "### Settlement in the entity\u2019s own equity instruments (paragraph 16(b))\n21 A contract is not an equity instrument solely because it may result in the receipt or delivery of the entity\u2019s\nown equity instruments. An entity may have a contractual right or obligation to receive or deliver a number\nof its own shares or other equity instruments that varies so that the fair value of the entity\u2019s own equity\ninstruments to be received or delivered equals the amount of the contractual right or obligation. Such a\ncontractual right or obligation may be for a fixed amount or an amount that fluctuates in part or in full in\nresponse to changes in a variable other than the market price of the entity\u2019s own equity instruments (eg an\ninterest rate, a commodity price or a financial instrument price). Two examples are (a) a contract to deliver\nas many of the entity\u2019s own equity instruments as are equal in value to CU100,[1] and (b) a contract to\ndeliver as many of the entity\u2019s own equity instruments as are equal in value to the value of 100 ounces of\ngold. Such a contract is a financial liability of the entity even though the entity must or can settle it by\ndelivering its own equity instruments. It is not an equity instrument because the entity uses a variable\nnumber of its own equity instruments as a means to settle the contract. Accordingly, the contract does not\nevidence a residual interest in the entity\u2019s assets after deducting all of its liabilities.  \n22 Except as stated in paragraph 22A, a contract that will be settled by the entity (receiving or) delivering a\nfixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset\nis an equity instrument. For example, an issued share option that gives the counterparty a right to buy a\nfixed number of the entity\u2019s shares for a fixed price or for a fixed stated principal amount of a bond is an\nequity instrument. Changes in the fair value of a contract arising from variations in market interest rates that\ndo not affect the amount of cash or other financial assets to be paid or received, or the number of equity\ninstruments to be received or delivered, on settlement of the contract do not preclude the contract from\nbeing an equity instrument. Any consideration received (such as the premium received for a written option\nor warrant on the entity\u2019s own shares) is added directly to equity. Any consideration paid (such as the\npremium paid for a purchased option) is deducted directly from equity. Changes in the fair value of an\nequity instrument are not recognised in the financial statements.  \n22A If the entity\u2019s own equity instruments to be received, or delivered, by the entity upon settlement of a\ncontract are puttable financial instruments with all the features and meeting the conditions described in  \n1 In this Standard, monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units (CU)\u2019.  \n-----  paragraphs 16A and 16B, or instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a\npro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation with all the features and meeting the\nconditions described in paragraphs 16C and 16D, the contract is a financial asset or a financial liability.\nThis includes a contract that will be settled by the entity receiving or delivering a fixed number of such\ninstruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset.  \n23 With the exception of the circumstances described in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D,\na contract that contains an obligation for an entity to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or another\nfinancial asset gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount (for example,\nfor the present value of the forward repurchase price, option exercise price or other redemption amount).\nThis is the case even if the contract itself is an equity instrument. One example is an entity\u2019s obligation\nunder a forward contract to purchase its own equity instruments for cash. The financial liability is\nrecognised initially at the present value of the redemption amount, and is reclassified from equity.\nSubsequently, the financial liability is measured in accordance with AASB 9. If the contract expires without\ndelivery, the carrying amount of the financial liability is reclassified to equity. An entity\u2019s contractual\nobligation to purchase its own equity instruments gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of\nthe redemption amount even if the obligation to purchase is conditional on the counterparty exercising a\nright to redeem (eg a written put option that gives the counterparty the right to sell an entity\u2019s own equity\ninstruments to the entity for a fixed price).  \n24 A contract that will be settled by the entity delivering or receiving a fixed number of its own equity\ninstruments in exchange for a variable amount of cash or another financial asset is a financial asset or\nfinancial liability. An example is a contract for the entity to deliver 100 of its own equity instruments in\nreturn for an amount of cash calculated to equal the value of 100 ounces of gold.",

Such**\n**components shall be classified separately as financial liabilities, financial assets or equity instruments**\n**in accordance with paragraph 15.**  \n-----  29 An entity recognises separately the components of a financial instrument that (a) creates a financial liability\nof the entity and (b) grants an option to the holder of the instrument to convert it into an equity instrument\nof the entity. For example, a bond or similar instrument convertible by the holder into a fixed number of\nordinary shares of the entity is a compound financial instrument. From the perspective of the entity, such an\ninstrument comprises two components: a financial liability (a contractual arrangement to deliver cash or\nanother financial asset) and an equity instrument (a call option granting the holder the right, for a specified\nperiod of time, to convert it into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the entity). The economic effect of\nissuing such an instrument is substantially the same as issuing simultaneously a debt instrument with an\nearly settlement provision and warrants to purchase ordinary shares, or issuing a debt instrument with\ndetachable share purchase warrants. Accordingly, in all cases, the entity presents the liability and equity\ncomponents separately in its statement of financial position.  \n30 Classification of the liability and equity components of a convertible instrument is not revised as a result of\na change in the likelihood that a conversion option will be exercised, even when exercise of the option may\nappear to have become economically advantageous to some holders. Holders may not always act in the way\nthat might be expected because, for example, the tax consequences resulting from conversion may differ\namong holders. Furthermore, the likelihood of conversion will change from time to time. The entity\u2019s\ncontractual obligation to make future payments remains outstanding until it is extinguished through\nconversion, maturity of the instrument or some other transaction.  \n31 AASB 9 deals with the measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. Equity instruments are\ninstruments that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.\nTherefore, when the initial carrying amount of a compound financial instrument is allocated to its equity\nand liability components, the equity component is assigned the residual amount after deducting from the fair\nvalue of the instrument as a whole the amount separately determined for the liability component. The value\nof any derivative features (such as a call option) embedded in the compound financial instrument other than\nthe equity component (such as an equity conversion option) is included in the liability component. The sum\nof the carrying amounts assigned to the liability and equity components on initial recognition is always\nequal to the fair value that would be ascribed to the instrument as a whole. No gain or loss arises from\ninitially recognising the components of the instrument separately.  \n32 Under the approach described in paragraph 31, the issuer of a bond convertible into ordinary shares first\ndetermines the carrying amount of the liability component by measuring the fair value of a similar liability\n(including any embedded non-equity derivative features) that does not have an associated equity\ncomponent. The carrying amount of the equity instrument represented by the option to convert the\ninstrument into ordinary shares is then determined by deducting the fair value of the financial liability from\nthe fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole.",

Distributions to holders of**\n**an equity instrument shall be recognised by the entity directly in equity. Transaction costs of an**\n**equity transaction shall be accounted for as a deduction from equity.**  \n35A Income tax relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs of an equity\ntransaction shall be accounted for in accordance with AASB 112 Income Taxes.  \n36 The classification of a financial instrument as a financial liability or an equity instrument determines\nwhether interest, dividends, losses and gains relating to that instrument are recognised as income or expense\nin profit or loss. Thus, dividend payments on shares wholly recognised as liabilities are recognised as\nexpenses in the same way as interest on a bond. Similarly, gains and losses associated with redemptions or\nrefinancings of financial liabilities are recognised in profit or loss, whereas redemptions or refinancings of\nequity instruments are recognised as changes in equity. Changes in the fair value of an equity instrument are\nnot recognised in the financial statements.  \n37 An entity typically incurs various costs in issuing or acquiring its own equity instruments. Those costs\nmight include registration and other regulatory fees, amounts paid to legal, accounting and other\nprofessional advisers, printing costs and stamp duties. The transaction costs of an equity transaction are\naccounted for as a deduction from equity to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the\nequity transaction that otherwise would have been avoided. The costs of an equity transaction that is\nabandoned are recognised as an expense.  \n38 Transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound financial instrument are allocated to the liability and\nequity components of the instrument in proportion to the allocation of proceeds. Transaction costs that\nrelate jointly to more than one transaction (for example, costs of a concurrent offering of some shares and a\nstock exchange listing of other shares) are allocated to those transactions using a basis of allocation that is\nrational and consistent with similar transactions.  \n39 The amount of transaction costs accounted for as a deduction from equity in the period is disclosed\nseparately in accordance with AASB 101.  \n40 Dividends classified as an expense may be presented in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income either with interest on other liabilities or as a separate item. In addition to the\nrequirements of this Standard, disclosure of interest and dividends is subject to the requirements of\nAASB 101 and AASB 7. In some circumstances, because of the differences between interest and dividends\nwith respect to matters such as tax deductibility, it is desirable to disclose them separately in the\nstatement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Disclosures of the tax effects are made in\naccordance with AASB 112.  \n41 Gains and losses related to changes in the carrying amount of a financial liability are recognised as income\nor expense in profit or loss even when they relate to an instrument that includes a right to the residual\ninterest in the assets of the entity in exchange for cash or another financial asset (see paragraph 18(b)).\nUnder AASB 101 the entity presents any gain or loss arising from remeasurement of such an instrument\nseparately in the statement of comprehensive income when it is relevant in explaining the entity\u2019s\nperformance.",

In other circumstances, financial assets and financial liabilities\nare presented separately from each other consistently with their characteristics as resources or obligations of  \n-----  the entity. An entity shall disclose the information required in paragraphs 13B\u201313E of AASB 7 for\nrecognised financial instruments that are within the scope of paragraph 13A of AASB 7.  \n44 Offsetting a recognised financial asset and a recognised financial liability and presenting the net amount\ndiffers from the derecognition of a financial asset or a financial liability. Although offsetting does not give\nrise to recognition of a gain or loss, the derecognition of a financial instrument not only results in the\nremoval of the previously recognised item from the statement of financial position but also may result in\nrecognition of a gain or loss.  \n45 A right of set-off is a debtor\u2019s legal right, by contract or otherwise, to settle or otherwise eliminate all or a\nportion of an amount due to a creditor by applying against that amount an amount due from the creditor. In\nunusual circumstances, a debtor may have a legal right to apply an amount due from a third party against\nthe amount due to a creditor provided that there is an agreement between the three parties that clearly\nestablishes the debtor\u2019s right of set-off. Because the right of set-off is a legal right, the conditions\nsupporting the right may vary from one legal jurisdiction to another and the laws applicable to the\nrelationships between the parties need to be considered.  \n46 The existence of an enforceable right to set off a financial asset and a financial liability affects the rights\nand obligations associated with a financial asset and a financial liability and may affect an entity\u2019s exposure\nto credit and liquidity risk. However, the existence of the right, by itself, is not a sufficient basis for\noffsetting. In the absence of an intention to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, the amount and\ntiming of an entity\u2019s future cash flows are not affected. When an entity intends to exercise the right or to\nsettle simultaneously, presentation of the asset and liability on a net basis reflects more appropriately the\namounts and timing of the expected future cash flows, as well as the risks to which those cash flows are\nexposed. An intention by one or both parties to settle on a net basis without the legal right to do so is not\nsufficient to justify offsetting because the rights and obligations associated with the individual financial\nasset and financial liability remain unaltered.  \n47 An entity\u2019s intentions with respect to settlement of particular assets and liabilities may be influenced by its\nnormal business practices, the requirements of the financial markets and other circumstances that may limit\nthe ability to settle net or to settle simultaneously. When an entity has a right of set-off, but does not intend\nto settle net or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously, the effect of the right on the entity\u2019s\ncredit risk exposure is disclosed in accordance with paragraph 36 of AASB 7.  \n48 Simultaneous settlement of two financial instruments may occur through, for example, the operation of a\nclearing house in an organised financial market or a face-to-face exchange. In these circumstances the cash\nflows are, in effect, equivalent to a single net amount and there is no exposure to credit or liquidity risk. In\nother circumstances, an entity may settle two instruments by receiving and paying separate amounts,\nbecoming exposed to credit risk for the full amount of the asset or liquidity risk for the full amount of the\nliability. Such risk exposures may be significant even though relatively brief. Accordingly, realisation of a\nfinancial asset and settlement of a financial liability are treated as simultaneous only when the transactions\noccur at the same moment.  \n49 The conditions set out in paragraph 42 are generally not satisfied and offsetting is usually inappropriate\nwhen:  \n(a) several different financial instruments are used to emulate the features of a single financial\ninstrument (a \u2018synthetic instrument\u2019);  \n(b) financial assets and financial liabilities arise from financial instruments having the same primary\nrisk exposure (for example, assets and liabilities within a portfolio of forward contracts or other\nderivative instruments) but involve different counterparties;  \n(c) financial or other assets are pledged as collateral for non-recourse financial liabilities;  \n(d) financial assets are set aside in trust by a debtor for the purpose of discharging an obligation\nwithout those assets having been accepted by the creditor in settlement of the obligation (for\nexample, a sinking fund arrangement); or  \n(e) obligations incurred as a result of events giving rise to losses are expected to be recovered from a\nthird party by virtue of a claim made under an insurance contract.  \n50 An entity that undertakes a number of financial instrument transactions with a single counterparty may enter\ninto a \u2018master netting arrangement\u2019 with that counterparty. Such an agreement provides for a single net\nsettlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default on, or termination\nof, any one contract. These arrangements are commonly used by financial institutions to provide protection\nagainst loss in the event of bankruptcy or other circumstances that result in a counterparty being unable to\nmeet its obligations. A master netting arrangement commonly creates a right of set-off that becomes\nenforceable and affects the realisation or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities\nonly following a specified event of default or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal  \n-----  course of business. A master netting arrangement does not provide a basis for offsetting unless both of the\ncriteria in paragraph 42 are satisfied. When financial assets and financial liabilities subject to a master\nnetting arrangement are not offset, the effect of the arrangement on an entity\u2019s exposure to credit risk is\ndisclosed in accordance with paragraph 36 of AASB 7.  \n51\u2013\n95 [Deleted]",

A deposit of cash with a\nbank or similar financial institution is a financial asset because it represents the contractual right of the\ndepositor to obtain cash from the institution or to draw a cheque or similar instrument against the balance in\nfavour of a creditor in payment of a financial liability.  \nAG4 Common examples of financial assets representing a contractual right to receive cash in the future and\ncorresponding financial liabilities representing a contractual obligation to deliver cash in the future are:  \n(a) trade accounts receivable and payable;  \n(b) notes receivable and payable;  \n(c) loans receivable and payable; and  \n(d) bonds receivable and payable.  \nIn each case, one party\u2019s contractual right to receive (or obligation to pay) cash is matched by the other\nparty\u2019s corresponding obligation to pay (or right to receive).  \nAG5 Another type of financial instrument is one for which the economic benefit to be received or given up is a\nfinancial asset other than cash. For example, a note payable in government bonds gives the holder the\ncontractual right to receive and the issuer the contractual obligation to deliver government bonds, not cash.\nThe bonds are financial assets because they represent obligations of the issuing government to pay cash.\nThe note is, therefore, a financial asset of the note holder and a financial liability of the note issuer.  \nAG6 \u2018Perpetual\u2019 debt instruments (such as \u2018perpetual\u2019 bonds, debentures and capital notes) normally provide the\nholder with the contractual right to receive payments on account of interest at fixed dates extending into the\nindefinite future, either with no right to receive a return of principal or a right to a return of principal under\nterms that make it very unlikely or very far in the future. For example, an entity may issue a financial\ninstrument requiring it to make annual payments in perpetuity equal to a stated interest rate of 8 per cent\napplied to a stated par or principal amount of CU1,000.[2] Assuming 8 per cent to be the market rate of\ninterest for the instrument when issued, the issuer assumes a contractual obligation to make a stream of\nfuture interest payments having a fair value (present value) of CU1,000 on initial recognition. The holder\nand issuer of the instrument have a financial asset and a financial liability, respectively.  \nAG7 A contractual right or contractual obligation to receive, deliver or exchange financial instruments is itself a\nfinancial instrument. A chain of contractual rights or contractual obligations meets the definition of a\nfinancial instrument if it will ultimately lead to the receipt or payment of cash or to the acquisition or issue\nof an equity instrument.  \nAG8 The ability to exercise a contractual right or the requirement to satisfy a contractual obligation may be\nabsolute, or it may be contingent on the occurrence of a future event. For example, a financial guarantee is a\ncontractual right of the lender to receive cash from the guarantor, and a corresponding contractual\nobligation of the guarantor to pay the lender, if the borrower defaults. The contractual right and obligation\nexist because of a past transaction or event (assumption of the guarantee), even though the lender\u2019s ability\nto exercise its right and the requirement for the guarantor to perform under its obligation are both contingent\non a future act of default by the borrower. A contingent right and obligation meet the definition of a\nfinancial asset and a financial liability, even though such assets and liabilities are not always recognised in  \n2 In this guidance, monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units (CU)\u2019.  \n-----  the financial statements. Some of these contingent rights and obligations may be contracts within the scope\nof AASB 17.  \nAusAG8.1 For public sector entities, some of the contingent rights and obligations addressed in paragraph\nAG8 may be insurance contracts within the scope of AASB 4.  \nAG9 A lease typically creates an entitlement of the lessor to receive, and an obligation of the lessee to pay, a\nstream of payments that are substantially the same as blended payments of principal and interest under a\nloan agreement. The lessor accounts for its investment in the amount receivable under a finance lease rather\nthan the underlying asset itself that is subject to the finance lease. Accordingly, a lessor regards a finance\nlease as a financial instrument. Under AASB 16, a lessor does not recognise its entitlement to receive lease\npayments under an operating lease. The lessor continues to account for the underlying asset itself rather\nthan any amount receivable in the future under the contract. Accordingly, a lessor does not regard an\noperating lease as a financial instrument, except as regards individual payments currently due and payable\nby the lessee.  \nAG10 Physical assets (such as inventories, property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and intangible assets\n(such as patents and trademarks) are not financial assets. Control of such physical assets, right-of-use assets\nand intangible assets creates an opportunity to generate an inflow of cash or another financial asset, but it\ndoes not give rise to a present right to receive cash or another financial asset.  \nAG11 Assets (such as prepaid expenses) for which the future economic benefit is the receipt of goods or services,\nrather than the right to receive cash or another financial asset, are not financial assets. Similarly, items such\nas deferred revenue and most warranty obligations are not financial liabilities because the outflow of\neconomic benefits associated with them is the delivery of goods and services rather than a contractual\nobligation to pay cash or another financial asset.  \nAG12 Liabilities or assets that are not contractual (such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory\nrequirements imposed by governments) are not financial liabilities or financial assets. Accounting for\nincome taxes is dealt with in AASB 112. Similarly, constructive obligations, as defined in AASB 137\n_Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, do not arise from contracts and are not financial_\nliabilities.",

An entity\u2019s obligation to issue or purchase\na fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial\nasset is an equity instrument of the entity (except as stated in paragraph 22A). However, if such a contract\ncontains an obligation for the entity to pay cash or another financial asset (other than a contract classified as\nequity in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D), it also gives rise to a\nliability for the present value of the redemption amount (see paragraph AG27(a)). An issuer of non-puttable\nordinary shares assumes a liability when it formally acts to make a distribution and becomes legally obliged\nto the shareholders to do so. This may be the case following the declaration of a dividend or when the entity\nis being wound up and any assets remaining after the satisfaction of liabilities become distributable to\nshareholders.  \nAG14 A purchased call option or other similar contract acquired by an entity that gives it the right to reacquire a\nfixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for delivering a fixed amount of cash or another\nfinancial asset is not a financial asset of the entity (except as stated in paragraph 22A). Instead, any\nconsideration paid for such a contract is deducted from equity.  \n**The class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes**\n**(paragraphs 16A(b) and 16C(b))**  \nAG14A One of the features of paragraphs 16A and 16C is that the financial instrument is in the class of instruments  \nthat is subordinate to all other classes.  \nAG14B When determining whether an instrument is in the subordinate class, an entity evaluates the instrument\u2019s  \nclaim on liquidation as if it were to liquidate on the date when it classifies the instrument. An entity shall\nreassess the classification if there is a change in relevant circumstances. For example, if the entity issues or  \n-----  redeems another financial instrument, this may affect whether the instrument in question is in the class of\ninstruments that is subordinate to all other classes.  \nAG14C An instrument that has a preferential right on liquidation of the entity is not an instrument with an  \nentitlement to a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity. For example, an instrument has a preferential\nright on liquidation if it entitles the holder to a fixed dividend on liquidation, in addition to a share of the\nentity\u2019s net assets, when other instruments in the subordinate class with a right to a pro rata share of the net\nassets of the entity do not have the same right on liquidation.  \nAG14D If an entity has only one class of financial instruments, that class shall be treated as if it were subordinate to  \nall other classes.  \n**Total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument over the life of the**\n**instrument (paragraph 16A(e))**  \nAG14E The total expected cash flows of the instrument over the life of the instrument must be substantially based\non the profit or loss, change in the recognised net assets or fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net\nassets of the entity over the life of the instrument. Profit or loss and the change in the recognised net assets\nshall be measured in accordance with relevant Australian Accounting Standards.  \n**Transactions entered into by an instrument holder other than as owner of the**\n**entity (paragraphs 16A and 16C)**  \nAG14F The holder of a puttable financial instrument or an instrument that imposes on the entity an obligation to\ndeliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation may enter into\ntransactions with the entity in a role other than that of an owner. For example, an instrument holder may\nalso be an employee of the entity. Only the cash flows and the contractual terms and conditions of the\ninstrument that relate to the instrument holder as an owner of the entity shall be considered when assessing\nwhether the instrument should be classified as equity under paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C.  \nAG14G An example is a limited partnership that has limited and general partners. Some general partners may  \nprovide a guarantee to the entity and may be remunerated for providing that guarantee. In such situations,\nthe guarantee and the associated cash flows relate to the instrument holders in their role as guarantors and\nnot in their roles as owners of the entity. Therefore, such a guarantee and the associated cash flows would\nnot result in the general partners being considered subordinate to the limited partners, and would be\ndisregarded when assessing whether the contractual terms of the limited partnership instruments and the\ngeneral partnership instruments are identical.  \nAG14H Another example is a profit or loss sharing arrangement that allocates profit or loss to the instrument  \nholders on the basis of services rendered or business generated during the current and previous years. Such\narrangements are transactions with instrument holders in their role as non-owners and should not be\nconsidered when assessing the features listed in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C. However, profit or loss\nsharing arrangements that allocate profit or loss to instrument holders based on the nominal amount of their\ninstruments relative to others in the class represent transactions with the instrument holders in their roles as\nowners and should be considered when assessing the features listed in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C.  \nAG14I The cash flows and contractual terms and conditions of a transaction between the instrument holder (in the\nrole as a non-owner) and the issuing entity must be similar to an equivalent transaction that might occur\nbetween a non-instrument holder and the issuing entity.  \n**No other financial instrument or contract with total cash flows that**\n**substantially fixes or restricts the residual return to the instrument holder**\n**(paragraphs 16B and 16D)**  \nAG14J A condition for classifying as equity a financial instrument that otherwise meets the criteria in paragraph\n16A or paragraph 16C is that the entity has no other financial instrument or contract that has (a) total cash\nflows based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in the\nfair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity and (b) the effect of substantially\nrestricting or fixing the residual return. The following instruments, when entered into on normal commercial\nterms with unrelated parties, are unlikely to prevent instruments that otherwise meet the criteria in\nparagraph 16A or paragraph 16C from being classified as equity:  \n(a) instruments with total cash flows substantially based on specific assets of the entity.  \n(b) instruments with total cash flows based on a percentage of revenue.  \n(c) contracts designed to reward individual employees for services rendered to the entity.  \n-----  (d) contracts requiring the payment of an insignificant percentage of profit for services rendered or\ngoods provided.",

        "page_content=": "## Derivative financial instruments  \nAG15 Financial instruments include primary instruments (such as receivables, payables and equity instruments)\nand derivative financial instruments (such as financial options, futures and forwards, interest rate swaps and\ncurrency swaps). Derivative financial instruments meet the definition of a financial instrument and,\naccordingly, are within the scope of this Standard.  \nAG16 Derivative financial instruments create rights and obligations that have the effect of transferring between the\nparties to the instrument one or more of the financial risks inherent in an underlying primary financial\ninstrument. On inception, derivative financial instruments give one party a contractual right to exchange\nfinancial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially favourable, or\na contractual obligation to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under\nconditions that are potentially unfavourable. However, they generally[3] do not result in a transfer of the\nunderlying primary financial instrument on inception of the contract, nor does such a transfer necessarily\ntake place on maturity of the contract. Some instruments embody both a right and an obligation to make an\nexchange. Because the terms of the exchange are determined on inception of the derivative instrument, as\nprices in financial markets change those terms may become either favourable or unfavourable.  \nAG17 A put or call option to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities (ie financial instruments other than\nan entity\u2019s own equity instruments) gives the holder a right to obtain potential future economic benefits\nassociated with changes in the fair value of the financial instrument underlying the contract. Conversely, the\nwriter of an option assumes an obligation to forgo potential future economic benefits or bear potential losses\nof economic benefits associated with changes in the fair value of the underlying financial instrument. The\ncontractual right of the holder and obligation of the writer meet the definition of a financial asset and a\nfinancial liability, respectively. The financial instrument underlying an option contract may be any financial\nasset, including shares in other entities and interest-bearing instruments. An option may require the writer to\nissue a debt instrument, rather than transfer a financial asset, but the instrument underlying the option would\nconstitute a financial asset of the holder if the option were exercised. The option-holder\u2019s right to exchange\nthe financial asset under potentially favourable conditions and the writer\u2019s obligation to exchange the\nfinancial asset under potentially unfavourable conditions are distinct from the underlying financial asset to\nbe exchanged upon exercise of the option. The nature of the holder\u2019s right and of the writer\u2019s obligation are\nnot affected by the likelihood that the option will be exercised.  \nAG18 Another example of a derivative financial instrument is a forward contract to be settled in six months\u2019 time\nin which one party (the purchaser) promises to deliver CU1,000,000 cash in exchange for CU1,000,000 face\namount of fixed rate government bonds, and the other party (the seller) promises to deliver CU1,000,000\nface amount of fixed rate government bonds in exchange for CU1,000,000 cash. During the six months,\nboth parties have a contractual right and a contractual obligation to exchange financial instruments. If the\nmarket price of the government bonds rises above CU1,000,000, the conditions will be favourable to the\npurchaser and unfavourable to the seller; if the market price falls below CU1,000,000, the effect will be the\nopposite. The purchaser has a contractual right (a financial asset) similar to the right under a call option held\nand a contractual obligation (a financial liability) similar to the obligation under a put option written; the\nseller has a contractual right (a financial asset) similar to the right under a put option held and a contractual\nobligation (a financial liability) similar to the obligation under a call option written. As with options, these\ncontractual rights and obligations constitute financial assets and financial liabilities separate and distinct\nfrom the underlying financial instruments (the bonds and cash to be exchanged). Both parties to a forward\ncontract have an obligation to perform at the agreed time, whereas performance under an option contract\noccurs only if and when the holder of the option chooses to exercise it.  \nAG19 Many other types of derivative instruments embody a right or obligation to make a future exchange,\nincluding interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate caps, collars and floors, loan commitments, note\nissuance facilities and letters of credit. An interest rate swap contract may be viewed as a variation of a\nforward contract in which the parties agree to make a series of future exchanges of cash amounts, one\namount calculated with reference to a floating interest rate and the other with reference to a fixed interest\nrate. Futures contracts are another variation of forward contracts, differing primarily in that the contracts are\nstandardised and traded on an exchange.  \n3 This is true of most, but not all derivatives, eg in some cross-currency interest rate swaps principal is exchanged on inception (and reexchanged on maturity).  \n-----  ",

For example, contracts that provide for settlement only by the receipt or delivery of a nonfinancial item (eg an option, futures or forward contract on silver) are not financial instruments. Many\ncommodity contracts are of this type. Some are standardised in form and traded on organised markets in\nmuch the same fashion as some derivative financial instruments. For example, a commodity futures contract\nmay be bought and sold readily for cash because it is listed for trading on an exchange and may change\nhands many times. However, the parties buying and selling the contract are, in effect, trading the underlying\ncommodity. The ability to buy or sell a commodity contract for cash, the ease with which it may be bought\nor sold and the possibility of negotiating a cash settlement of the obligation to receive or deliver the\ncommodity do not alter the fundamental character of the contract in a way that creates a financial\ninstrument. Nevertheless, some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items that can be settled net or by\nexchanging financial instruments, or in which the non-financial item is readily convertible to cash, are\nwithin the scope of the Standard as if they were financial instruments (see paragraph 8).  \nAG21 Except as required by AASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a contract that involves the_\nreceipt or delivery of physical assets does not give rise to a financial asset of one party and a financial\nliability of the other party unless any corresponding payment is deferred past the date on which the physical\nassets are transferred. Such is the case with the purchase or sale of goods on trade credit.  \nAG22 Some contracts are commodity-linked, but do not involve settlement through the physical receipt or\ndelivery of a commodity. They specify settlement through cash payments that are determined according to a\nformula in the contract, rather than through payment of fixed amounts. For example, the principal amount\nof a bond may be calculated by applying the market price of oil prevailing at the maturity of the bond to a\nfixed quantity of oil. The principal is indexed by reference to a commodity price, but is settled only in cash.\nSuch a contract constitutes a financial instrument.  \nAG23 The definition of a financial instrument also encompasses a contract that gives rise to a non-financial asset\nor non-financial liability in addition to a financial asset or financial liability. Such financial instruments\noften give one party an option to exchange a financial asset for a non-financial asset. For example, an oillinked bond may give the holder the right to receive a stream of fixed periodic interest payments and a fixed\namount of cash on maturity, with the option to exchange the principal amount for a fixed quantity of oil.\nThe desirability of exercising this option will vary from time to time depending on the fair value of oil\nrelative to the exchange ratio of cash for oil (the exchange price) inherent in the bond. The intentions of the\nbondholder concerning the exercise of the option do not affect the substance of the component assets. The\nfinancial asset of the holder and the financial liability of the issuer make the bond a financial instrument,\nregardless of the other types of assets and liabilities also created.  \nAG24 [Deleted]",

In determining whether a preference share is a\nfinancial liability or an equity instrument, an issuer assesses the particular rights attaching to the share to\ndetermine whether it exhibits the fundamental characteristic of a financial liability. For example, a\npreference share that provides for redemption on a specific date or at the option of the holder contains a\nfinancial liability because the issuer has an obligation to transfer financial assets to the holder of the share.\nThe potential inability of an issuer to satisfy an obligation to redeem a preference share when contractually\nrequired to do so, whether because of a lack of funds, a statutory restriction or insufficient profits or\nreserves, does not negate the obligation. An option of the issuer to redeem the shares for cash does not\nsatisfy the definition of a financial liability because the issuer does not have a present obligation to transfer\nfinancial assets to the shareholders. In this case, redemption of the shares is solely at the discretion of the\nissuer. An obligation may arise, however, when the issuer of the shares exercises its option, usually by\nformally notifying the shareholders of an intention to redeem the shares.  \n-----  AG26 When preference shares are non-redeemable, the appropriate classification is determined by the other rights\nthat attach to them. Classification is based on an assessment of the substance of the contractual\narrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. When distributions to\nholders of the preference shares, whether cumulative or non-cumulative, are at the discretion of the issuer,\nthe shares are equity instruments. The classification of a preference share as an equity instrument or a\nfinancial liability is not affected by, for example:  \n(a) a history of making distributions;  \n(b) an intention to make distributions in the future;  \n(c) a possible negative impact on the price of ordinary shares of the issuer if distributions are not\nmade (because of restrictions on paying dividends on the ordinary shares if dividends are not paid\non the preference shares);  \n(d) the amount of the issuer\u2019s reserves;  \n(e) an issuer\u2019s expectation of a profit or loss for a period; or  \n(f) an ability or inability of the issuer to influence the amount of its profit or loss for the period.",

Accordingly, any consideration received or paid for such a contract is added directly to or\ndeducted directly from equity. One example is an issued share option that gives the counterparty a\nright to buy a fixed number of the entity\u2019s shares for a fixed amount of cash. However, if the\ncontract requires the entity to purchase (redeem) its own shares for cash or another financial asset\nat a fixed or determinable date or on demand, the entity also recognises a financial liability for the\npresent value of the redemption amount (with the exception of instruments that have all the\nfeatures and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D). One\nexample is an entity\u2019s obligation under a forward contract to repurchase a fixed number of its\nown shares for a fixed amount of cash.  \n(b) An entity\u2019s obligation to purchase its own shares for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the\npresent value of the redemption amount even if the number of shares that the entity is obliged to\nrepurchase is not fixed or if the obligation is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to\nredeem (except as stated in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D). One example\nof a conditional obligation is an issued option that requires the entity to repurchase its own shares\nfor cash if the counterparty exercises the option.  \n(c) A contract that will be settled in cash or another financial asset is a financial asset or financial\nliability even if the amount of cash or another financial asset that will be received or delivered is\nbased on changes in the market price of the entity\u2019s own equity (except as stated in paragraphs\n16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D). One example is a net cash-settled share option.  \n(d) A contract that will be settled in a variable number of the entity\u2019s own shares whose value equals\na fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable (eg a commodity price)\nis a financial asset or a financial liability. An example is a written option to buy gold that, if\nexercised, is settled net in the entity\u2019s own instruments by the entity delivering as many of those\ninstruments as are equal to the value of the option contract. Such a contract is a financial asset or\nfinancial liability even if the underlying variable is the entity\u2019s own share price rather than gold.\nSimilarly, a contract that will be settled in a fixed number of the entity\u2019s own shares, but the\nrights attaching to those shares will be varied so that the settlement value equals a fixed amount\nor an amount based on changes in an underlying variable, is a financial asset or a financial\nliability.",

Thus, a\ncontract that requires settlement in cash or a variable number of the entity\u2019s own shares only on the  \n-----  occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur is an equity\ninstrument.

When\nclassifying a financial instrument (or a component of it) in consolidated financial statements, an entity\nconsiders all terms and conditions agreed between members of the group and the holders of the instrument\nin determining whether the group as a whole has an obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset in\nrespect of the instrument or to settle it in a manner that results in liability classification. When a subsidiary\nin a group issues a financial instrument and a parent or other group entity agrees additional terms directly\nwith the holders of the instrument (eg a guarantee), the group may not have discretion over distributions or\nredemption. Although the subsidiary may appropriately classify the instrument without regard to these\nadditional terms in its individual financial statements, the effect of other agreements between members of\nthe group and the holders of the instrument is considered in order to ensure that consolidated financial\nstatements reflect the contracts and transactions entered into by the group as a whole. To the extent that\nthere is such an obligation or settlement provision, the instrument (or the component of it that is subject to\nthe obligation) is classified as a financial liability in consolidated financial statements.  \nAG29A Some types of instruments that impose a contractual obligation on the entity are classified as equity  \ninstruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.

Paragraph 28 does\nnot deal with compound financial instruments from the perspective of holders. AASB 9 deals with the\nclassification and measurement of financial assets that are compound financial instruments from the\nholder\u2019s perspective.  \nAG31 A common form of compound financial instrument is a debt instrument with an embedded conversion\noption, such as a bond convertible into ordinary shares of the issuer, and without any other embedded\nderivative features. Paragraph 28 requires the issuer of such a financial instrument to present the liability\ncomponent and the equity component separately in the statement of financial position, as follows:  \n(a) The issuer\u2019s obligation to make scheduled payments of interest and principal is a financial\nliability that exists as long as the instrument is not converted. On initial recognition, the fair value\nof the liability component is the present value of the contractually determined stream of future\ncash flows discounted at the rate of interest applied at that time by the market to instruments of\ncomparable credit status and providing substantially the same cash flows, on the same terms, but\nwithout the conversion option.  \n(b) The equity instrument is an embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the issuer. This\noption has value on initial recognition even when it is out of the money.  \nAG32 On conversion of a convertible instrument at maturity, the entity derecognises the liability component and\nrecognises it as equity. The original equity component remains as equity (although it may be transferred\nfrom one line item within equity to another). There is no gain or loss on conversion at maturity.  \nAG33 When an entity extinguishes a convertible instrument before maturity through an early redemption or\nrepurchase in which the original conversion privileges are unchanged, the entity allocates the consideration\npaid and any transaction costs for the repurchase or redemption to the liability and equity components of the\ninstrument at the date of the transaction. The method used in allocating the consideration paid and\ntransaction costs to the separate components is consistent with that used in the original allocation to the\nseparate components of the proceeds received by the entity when the convertible instrument was issued, in\naccordance with paragraphs 28\u201332.  \nAG34 Once the allocation of the consideration is made, any resulting gain or loss is treated in accordance with\naccounting principles applicable to the related component, as follows:  \n-----  (a) the amount of gain or loss relating to the liability component is recognised in profit or loss; and  \n(b) the amount of consideration relating to the equity component is recognised in equity.  \nAG35 An entity may amend the terms of a convertible instrument to induce early conversion, for example by\noffering a more favourable conversion ratio or paying other additional consideration in the event of\nconversion before a specified date. The difference, at the date the terms are amended, between the fair value\nof the consideration the holder receives on conversion of the instrument under the revised terms and the fair\nvalue of the consideration the holder would have received under the original terms is recognised as a loss in\nprofit or loss.",

For example, the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a jurisdiction may prohibit,\nor restrict, the right of set-off in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency in some circumstances.  \nAG38D The laws applicable to the relationships between the parties (for example, contractual provisions, the laws  \ngoverning the contract, or the default, insolvency or bankruptcy laws applicable to the parties) need to be\nconsidered to ascertain whether the right of set-off is enforceable in the normal course of business, in an\nevent of default, and in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy, of the entity and all of the counterparties (as\nspecified in paragraph AG38B(b)).  \n**Criterion that an entity \u2018intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the**\n**asset and settle the liability simultaneously\u2019 (paragraph 42(b))**  \nAG38E To meet the criterion in paragraph 42(b) an entity must intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously. Although the entity may have a right to settle net, it may still\nrealise the asset and settle the liability separately.  \nAG38F If an entity can settle amounts in a manner such that the outcome is, in effect, equivalent to net settlement,\nthe entity will meet the net settlement criterion in paragraph 42(b). This will occur if, and only if, the gross\nsettlement mechanism has features that eliminate or result in insignificant credit and liquidity risk, and that\nwill process receivables and payables in a single settlement process or cycle. For example, a gross\nsettlement system that has all of the following characteristics would meet the net settlement criterion in\nparagraph 42(b):  \n(a) financial assets and financial liabilities eligible for set-off are submitted at the same point in time\nfor processing;  \n(b) once the financial assets and financial liabilities are submitted for processing, the parties are\ncommitted to fulfil the settlement obligation;  \n(c) there is no potential for the cash flows arising from the assets and liabilities to change once they\nhave been submitted for processing (unless the processing fails\u2014see (d) below);  \n(d) assets and liabilities that are collateralised with securities will be settled on a securities transfer or\nsimilar system (for example, delivery versus payment), so that if the transfer of securities fails,\nthe processing of the related receivable or payable for which the securities are collateral will also\nfail (and vice versa);  \n(e) any transactions that fail, as outlined in (d), will be re-entered for processing until they are settled;  \n(f) settlement is carried out through the same settlement institution (for example, a settlement bank, a\ncentral bank or a central securities depository); and  \n(g) an intraday credit facility is in place that will provide sufficient overdraft amounts to enable the\nprocessing of payments at the settlement date for each of the parties, and it is virtually certain that\nthe intraday credit facility will be honoured if called upon.  \nAG39 The Standard does not provide special treatment for so-called \u2018synthetic instruments\u2019, which are groups of\nseparate financial instruments acquired and held to emulate the characteristics of another instrument. For\nexample, a floating rate long-term debt combined with an interest rate swap that involves receiving floating\npayments and making fixed payments synthesises a fixed rate long-term debt. Each of the individual\nfinancial instruments that together constitute a \u2018synthetic instrument\u2019 represents a contractual right or\nobligation with its own terms and conditions and each may be transferred or settled separately. Each\nfinancial instrument is exposed to risks that may differ from the risks to which other financial instruments\nare exposed. Accordingly, when one financial instrument in a \u2018synthetic instrument\u2019 is an asset and another\nis a liability, they are not offset and presented in an entity\u2019s statement of financial position on a net basis\nunless they meet the criteria for offsetting in paragraph 42.  \nAG40 [Deleted]  \n-----  ",
