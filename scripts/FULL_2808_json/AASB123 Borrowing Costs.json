When an entity borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a particular\nqualifying asset, the borrowing costs that directly relate to that qualifying asset can be readily identified.  \n11 It may be difficult to identify a direct relationship between particular borrowings and a qualifying asset and\nto determine the borrowings that could otherwise have been avoided. Such a difficulty occurs, for example,\nwhen the financing activity of an entity is co-ordinated centrally. Difficulties also arise when a group uses a\nrange of debt instruments to borrow funds at varying rates of interest, and lends those funds on various\nbases to other entities in the group. Other complications arise through the use of loans denominated in or\nlinked to foreign currencies, when the group operates in highly inflationary economies, and from\nfluctuations in exchange rates. As a result, the determination of the amount of borrowing costs that are\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset is difficult and the exercise of judgement is\nrequired.  \n**12** **To the extent that an entity borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset,**\n**the entity shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as the actual**\n**borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the**\n**temporary investment of those borrowings.**  \n13 The financing arrangements for a qualifying asset may result in an entity obtaining borrowed funds and\nincurring associated borrowing costs before some or all of the funds are used for expenditures on the\nqualifying asset. In such circumstances, the funds are often temporarily invested pending their expenditure\non the qualifying asset. In determining the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation during a\nperiod, any investment income earned on such funds is deducted from the borrowing costs incurred.  \n**14** **To the extent that an entity borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a**\n**qualifying asset, the entity shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by**\n**applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalisation rate shall be the**\n**weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to all borrowings of the entity that are**\n**outstanding during the period. However, an entity shall exclude from this calculation borrowing costs**\n**applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset until**\n**substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.**\n**The amount of borrowing costs that an entity capitalises during a period shall not exceed the amount**\n**of borrowing costs it incurred during that period.**  \n-----  15 In some circumstances, it is appropriate to include all borrowings of the parent and its subsidiaries when\ncomputing a weighted average of the borrowing costs; in other circumstances, it is appropriate for each\nsubsidiary to use a weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to its own borrowings.",

The commencement date for capitalisation is the date when the entity first**\n**meets all of the following conditions:**  \n**(a)** **it incurs expenditures for the asset;**  \n**(b)** **it incurs borrowing costs; and**  \n**(c)** **it undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.**  \n18 Expenditures on a qualifying asset include only those expenditures that have resulted in payments of cash,\ntransfers of other assets or the assumption of interest-bearing liabilities. Expenditures are reduced by any\nprogress payments received and grants received in connection with the asset (see AASB 120 Accounting for\n_Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance). The average carrying amount of the asset_\nduring a period, including borrowing costs previously capitalised, is normally a reasonable approximation\nof the expenditures to which the capitalisation rate is applied in that period.  \n19 The activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale encompass more than the physical\nconstruction of the asset. They include technical and administrative work prior to the commencement of\nphysical construction, such as the activities associated with obtaining permits prior to the commencement of\nthe physical construction. However, such activities exclude the holding of an asset when no production or\ndevelopment that changes the asset\u2019s condition is taking place. For example, borrowing costs incurred while\nland is under development are capitalised during the period in which activities related to the development\nare being undertaken. However, borrowing costs incurred while land acquired for building purposes is held\nwithout any associated development activity do not qualify for capitalisation.",

Such costs are costs of holding partially completed assets and\ndo not qualify for capitalisation. However, an entity does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs\nduring a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. An entity also does not\nsuspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an\nasset ready for its intended use or sale. For example, capitalisation continues during the extended period that\nhigh water levels delay construction of a bridge, if such high water levels are common during the\nconstruction period in the geographical region involved.",

Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors\nthan to others.  \nBC2 Before the mandatory application date of revised AASB 123 Borrowing Costs in 2009, the Board conducted\na review of the requirement in AASB 123 for not-for-profit entities to capitalise borrowing costs that are\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of\nthat asset. As a result of that review, in April 2009 the Board issued AASB 2009-1 _Amendments to_\n_Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Borrowing Costs of Not-for-Profit Public Sector Entities._\nAASB 2009-1 amended AASB 123 to allow not-for-profit public sector entities to expense borrowing costs\nas incurred, regardless of how the borrowings are applied.  \nBC3 The Board intended for the relief granted under AASB 2009-1 to be of an interim nature pending the\noutcome of:  \n(a) the work of the New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards Board (FRSB)[1] on the relationship\nbetween depreciated replacement cost and borrowing costs, in which the AASB agreed to\nparticipate;  \n(b) the AASB and FRSB work on developing a Process for Modifying, or Introducing Additional\nRequirements to, IFRSs for PBE/NFP; and  \n(c) the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (IPSASB\u2019s) Borrowing Costs\nproject.  \nBC4 In March 2011, the AASB decided to reactivate its project on the application of AASB 123 by not-for-profit\npublic sector entities, and evaluate the election for not-for-profit public sector entities to expense\nimmediately all borrowing costs against its Process for Modifying IFRSs for PBE/NFP (\u2018Process\u2019).  \nBC5 In September 2014, the Board discussed the modification for not-for-profit public sector entities to expense\nborrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying\nasset against its _Process. The Board noted that the International Valuation Standards Council issued_\nTechnical Information Paper 2 _The Cost Approach for Tangible Assets in April 2012, which includes_\ndiscussion of inputs included in a model based on the cost approach, and that the IPSASB\u2019s Borrowing Cost\nproject was on hold pending completion of the IPSASB\u2019s Conceptual Framework project.  \nBC6 The Board noted that it would not be appropriate for the accounting for borrowing costs of not-for-profit\npublic sector entities to differ from that of for-profit entities merely because the Board may favour a\ndifferent treatment conceptually. The Board confirmed that departure from the requirements of IAS 23\n_Borrowing Costs should only be permitted where not-for-profit specific reasons for departure exist._  \nBC7 The Board decided, on evaluation of IAS 23 against its _Process, that the modification for not-for-profit_\npublic sector entities should be retained in AASB 123. The Board decided to add a Basis for Conclusions to\nAASB 123 to reflect its conclusions in this regard.",

The Board observed that borrowing can\nbe related to funding government activities or, in the case of the Commonwealth and depending on the\neconomic circumstances, might have a public policy purpose such as supporting a domestic bond market.  \nBC10 The Board noted that Australian governments generally use centralised borrowing agencies and the\ndistribution of borrowings to government departments or other agencies could take a different form to the\ninitial debt raising, and that there may be little nexus between centralised borrowings and the individual\nqualifying assets in a government entity. Similarities in the use of centralised borrowing activities between\nthe Australian government and large private sector entities were considered. The Board also noted that the\nlevel of complexity in terms of the number of lines of credit and the number of group entities responsible\nfor acquiring or constructing qualifying assets is likely to be greater than that of the for-profit sector.  \nBC11 However, the Board also observed that the Standard envisages that entities may borrow centrally and\nacknowledges that this can create difficulties for determining whether a direct relationship between\nparticular borrowings and a qualifying asset exists, and that the exercise of judgement would be required in\nsuch situations.",

The Board noted that the\nrelatively brief time for which government-constructed assets would be qualifying assets that are measured\nat cost means that any benefit from including capitalising borrowing costs in the initial measurement of an\nasset would be very limited, as capitalising borrowing costs is consistent with a cost measurement model.\nThis is particularly the case in the context of long-lived assets such as infrastructure assets, on the basis that\nthe relative time for which an asset is likely to be measured at fair value would be significantly longer than\nthe time for which the asset is under construction (and measured at cost).",
