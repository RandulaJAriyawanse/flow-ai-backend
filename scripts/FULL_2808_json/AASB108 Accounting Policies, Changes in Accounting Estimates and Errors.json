If, following an amendment of such a pronouncement, the entity chooses to change an\naccounting policy, that change is accounted for and disclosed as a voluntary change in accounting policy.  \n_Retrospective application_  \n**22** **Subject to paragraph 23, when a change in accounting policy is applied retrospectively in accordance**\n**with paragraph 19(a) or (b), the entity shall adjust the opening balance of each affected component of**\n**equity for the earliest prior period presented and the other comparative amounts disclosed for each**\n**prior period presented as if the new accounting policy had always been applied.**  \n_Limitations on retrospective application_  \n**23** **When retrospective application is required by paragraph 19(a) or (b), a change in accounting policy**\n**shall be applied retrospectively except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the**\n**period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.**  \n**24** **When it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of changing an accounting policy on**\n**comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, the entity shall apply the new**\n**accounting policy to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the beginning of the earliest**\n**period for which retrospective application is practicable, which may be the current period, and shall**\n**make a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of each affected component of equity for**\n**that period.**  \n**25** **When it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect, at the beginning of the current period, of**\n**applying a new accounting policy to all prior periods, the entity shall adjust the comparative**\n**information to apply the new accounting policy prospectively from the earliest date practicable.**  \n26 When an entity applies a new accounting policy retrospectively, it applies the new accounting policy to\ncomparative information for prior periods as far back as is practicable. Retrospective application to a prior\nperiod is not practicable unless it is practicable to determine the cumulative effect on the amounts in both\nthe opening and closing statements of financial position for that period. The amount of the resulting\nadjustment relating to periods before those presented in the financial statements is made to the opening\nbalance of each affected component of equity of the earliest prior period presented. Usually the adjustment\nis made to retained earnings. However, the adjustment may be made to another component of equity (for  \n-----  example, to comply with an Australian Accounting Standard). Any other information about prior periods,\nsuch as historical summaries of financial data, is also adjusted as far back as is practicable.  \n27 When it is impracticable for an entity to apply a new accounting policy retrospectively, because it cannot\ndetermine the cumulative effect of applying the policy to all prior periods, the entity, in accordance with\nparagraph 25, applies the new policy prospectively from the start of the earliest period practicable. It\ntherefore disregards the portion of the cumulative adjustment to assets, liabilities and equity arising before\nthat date. Changing an accounting policy is permitted even if it is impracticable to apply the policy\nprospectively for any prior period. Paragraphs 50\u201353 provide guidance on when it is impracticable to apply\na new accounting policy to one or more prior periods.",

In such a case, an entity\ndevelops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by the accounting policy. Developing\naccounting estimates involves the use of judgements or assumptions based on the latest available, reliable\ninformation. Examples of accounting estimates include:  \n(a) a loss allowance for expected credit losses, applying AASB 9 Financial Instruments;  \n(b) the net realisable value of an item of inventory, applying AASB 102 Inventories;  \n(c) the fair value of an asset or liability, applying AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement;  \n(d) the depreciation expense for an item of property, plant and equipment, applying AASB 116; and  \n(e) a provision for warranty obligations, applying AASB 137 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and_\n_Contingent Assets._  \n32A An entity uses measurement techniques and inputs to develop an accounting estimate. Measurement\ntechniques include estimation techniques (for example, techniques used to measure a loss allowance for\nexpected credit losses applying AASB 9) and valuation techniques (for example, techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of an asset or liability applying AASB 13).  \n32B The term \u2018estimate\u2019 in Australian Accounting Standards sometimes refers to an estimate that is not an\naccounting estimate as defined in this Standard.

        "page_content=": "## Impracticability in respect of retrospective application and retrospective restatement  \n50 In some circumstances, it is impracticable to adjust comparative information for one or more prior periods\nto achieve comparability with the current period. For example, data may not have been collected in the prior\nperiod(s) in a way that allows either retrospective application of a new accounting policy (including, for the\npurpose of paragraphs 51\u201353, its prospective application to prior periods) or retrospective restatement to\ncorrect a prior period error, and it may be impracticable to recreate the information.  \n51 It is frequently necessary to make estimates in applying an accounting policy to elements of financial\nstatements recognised or disclosed in respect of transactions, other events or conditions. Estimation is\ninherently subjective, and estimates may be developed after the reporting period. Developing estimates is\npotentially more difficult when retrospectively applying an accounting policy or making a retrospective\nrestatement to correct a prior period error, because of the longer period of time that might have passed since\nthe affected transaction, other event or condition occurred. However, the objective of estimates related to\nprior periods remains the same as for estimates made in the current period, namely, for the estimate to\nreflect the circumstances that existed when the transaction, other event or condition occurred.  \n52 Therefore, retrospectively applying a new accounting policy or correcting a prior period error requires\ndistinguishing information that  \n(a) provides evidence of circumstances that existed on the date(s) as at which the transaction, other\nevent or condition occurred, and  \n(b) would have been available when the financial statements for that prior period were authorised for\nissue  \nfrom other information. For some types of estimates (eg a fair value measurement that uses significant\nunobservable inputs), it is impracticable to distinguish these types of information. When retrospective\napplication or retrospective restatement would require making a significant estimate for which it is\nimpossible to distinguish these two types of information, it is impracticable to apply the new accounting\npolicy or correct the prior period error retrospectively.  \n53 Hindsight should not be used when applying a new accounting policy to, or correcting amounts for, a prior\nperiod, either in making assumptions about what management\u2019s intentions would have been in a prior\nperiod or estimating the amounts recognised, measured or disclosed in a prior period. For example, when an\nentity corrects a prior period error in calculating its liability for employees\u2019 accumulated sick leave in\naccordance with AASB 119 _Employee Benefits, it disregards information about an unusually severe_\ninfluenza season during the next period that became available after the financial statements for the prior\nperiod were authorised for issue. The fact that significant estimates are frequently required when amending  \n-----  comparative information presented for prior periods does not prevent reliable adjustment or correction of\nthe comparative information.",
