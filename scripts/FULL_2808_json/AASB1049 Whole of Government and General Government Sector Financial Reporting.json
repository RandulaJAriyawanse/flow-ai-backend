This Standard only requires a different treatment from another\napplicable Australian Accounting Standard when the requirements of this Standard directly conflict with the\nrequirements of that other Standard. In particular, in relation to the GGS, in conflict with AASB 10\n_Consolidated Financial Statements, paragraph 19 prohibits the consolidation of controlled entities in other_\nsectors.  \n11 Where an Australian Accounting Standard:  \n(a) explicitly excludes from its scope not-for-profit entities, such as AASB 8 Operating Segments; or  \n(b) [deleted by the AASB]  \n(c) only applies to certain entities, such as listed companies, that are required to prepare financial\nreports in accordance with Part 2M.3 of the Corporations Act _2001, such as AASB 133 Earnings_\n_per Share;_  \nthe whole of government financial statements and the GGS financial statements are not required to adopt the\nrequirements of that Standard.  \n12 Paragraph 9 of AASB 1054 Australian Additional Disclosures applies to the whole of government. It does\nnot apply to the GGS. Accordingly, the GGS is not required to disclose whether its financial statements are\ngeneral purpose financial statements or special purpose financial statements.  \n**13** **In satisfying paragraph 9 of this Standard, subject to paragraph 13A, where compliance with the ABS**\n**GFS Manual would not conflict with Australian Accounting Standards, the principles and rules in the**\n**ABS GFS Manual shall be applied. In particular, certain Australian Accounting Standards allow**\n**optional treatments within their scope. Those optional treatments in Australian Accounting Standards**\n**aligned with the principles or rules in the ABS GFS Manual shall be applied.**  \n**13A** **A government is not required to early adopt Australian Accounting Standards.**  \n**13B** **Subject to paragraph 13C, for the purpose of this Standard, a government shall apply the version of**\n**the ABS GFS Manual effective at the beginning of the previous annual reporting period or any version**\n**effective at a later date, as the basis for GFS information included in the financial statements under**\n**this Standard. The date on which amendments to the ABS GFS Manual become effective is, for the**\n**purpose of this Standard, the publication date if no effective date is specified by the ABS.**  \n**13C** **A government may elect not to apply Chapter 2 Amendments to Defence Weapons Platforms of the ABS**\n**publication Amendments to Australian System of Government Finance Statistics, 2005 (ABS Catalogue**\n**No. 5514.0) \u2013 published on the ABS website on 5 April 2011 \u2013 in the financial statements prepared in**\n**accordance with this Standard for reporting periods ending before 30 June 2015.**  \n**13D** **Notwithstanding paragraph 13, a government may elect to measure a class of right-of-use assets at cost**\n**or at fair value in accordance with AASB 16 Leases for leases that had at inception significantly below-**\n**market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives.**  \n14 Examples of particular optional treatments in Australian Accounting Standards that paragraph 13 of this\nStandard has the effect of limiting, include:  \n(a) assets within the scope of AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment, AASB 138 Intangible Assets\nor AASB 140 Investment Property that may be measured at cost or at fair value. Those assets that\nare assets under the ABS GFS Manual that are within the scope of those Standards are required to\nbe measured at fair value because the ABS GFS Manual requires those assets to be measured at\nmarket value.  \nHowever, the fair value options allowed under AASB 116, AASB 138 and AASB 140 are not\namended by paragraph 13 of this Standard. If the fair value of an asset cannot be reliably measured\nin accordance with an Australian Accounting Standard that allows a choice between fair value and\ncost, then that asset is to be measured at cost. Where historical cost is adopted because fair value\ncannot be measured reliably, historical cost is not characterised as fair value. Also, for example,\nthe requirement for the fair value of an intangible asset to be determined by reference to an active\nmarket under AASB 138 continues to apply;  \n-----  (b) certain financial instruments that may be measured at fair value or on another basis under AASB 9\n_Financial Instruments. Where financial instruments meet the criteria for measurement at fair value_\nunder AASB 9, they are required to be measured at fair value where the ABS GFS Manual requires\nmarket value as the measurement basis.  \nAlthough fair value measurement in the statement of financial position may be mandated through\nparagraph 13 of this Standard, the accounting for changes in fair value in the statement of\ncomprehensive income is not mandated by paragraph 13. Rather, changes in fair value are\nclassified in the statement of comprehensive income in accordance with AASB 9. AASB 9\nanticipates certain financial assets being classified as either:  \n(i) \u2018fair value through profit or loss\u2019, with changes in fair value included in operating result;\nor  \n(ii) \u2018fair value through other comprehensive income\u2019, with changes in fair value included in\nthe other comprehensive income section of the statement of comprehensive income;  \n(c) [deleted]  \n(d) [deleted]  \n(e) cash flows from operating activities that may be reported using either the direct method or the\nindirect method in the statement of cash flows under AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows. Because\nthe direct method is consistent with the format of the cash flow statement under the ABS GFS\nManual, paragraph 13 of this Standard has the effect of requiring the direct method to be adopted;  \n(f) dividends paid by entities within the PNFC sector and PFC sector that may be classified by those\nsectors as a financing cash flow or as a component of cash flows from operating activities under\nAASB 107. Because classification as a financing cash flow is consistent with the format of the\ncash flow statement under the ABS GFS Manual, paragraph 13 of this Standard has the effect of\nrequiring classification of dividends paid as a financing cash flow; and  \n(g) government grants accounted for by entities within the PNFC sector and PFC sector in accordance\nwith AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. In\naccordance with paragraphs 52(b)(i) and 53 of this Standard, information about the PNFC sector\nand PFC sector disclosed for the whole of government is prepared in a manner consistent with the\naccounting policies adopted in the whole of government statement of financial position, statement\nof comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows. Therefore,\nthe options in AASB 120 are not adopted and instead the principles in AASB 1004 Contributions\nare applied.  \n15 Certain Australian Accounting Standards do not prescribe specific treatments for all items and issues within\ntheir scope. An example is AASB 101, which requires additional line items, headings and subtotals to be\npresented when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity\u2019s financial position. The ABS\nGFS Manual specifies principles and rules for the presentation of a balance sheet prepared for GFS purposes.\nThose ABS GFS Manual principles and rules are required to be applied in the presentation of the whole of\ngovernment statement of financial position and the GGS statement of financial position to the extent that they\ndo not conflict with AASB 101.  \n**16** **Subject to paragraphs 41(a)(i)(A) and 52(b)(ii)(A) of this Standard, key fiscal aggregates that are**\n**disclosed for the whole of government or the GGS, either because they are required by this Standard**\n**or a government elects to provide additional information, shall be measured in a manner that is**\n**consistent with amounts recognised in the corresponding statement of financial position, statement of**\n**comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows.**  \n17 This Standard requires certain information that is relevant to an assessment of the macro-economic impact\nof:  \n(a) a whole of government and GGS to be included in the statements of financial position, statements\nof comprehensive income and statements of cash flows (see paragraphs 28, 32 and 37); and  \n(b) a government\u2019s sectors to be included in the sector statements of financial position, statements of\ncomprehensive income and statements of cash flows required to be disclosed for the whole of\ngovernment by paragraph 52(b)(i).  \nThis Standard requires the information to be determined in a manner consistent with other amounts recognised\nin the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and\nstatement of cash flows. Corresponding amounts, determined in accordance with the ABS GFS Manual, are\nrequired to be disclosed in the notes where they differ from the amounts presented in the statement of financial\nposition, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows (see paragraphs 41(a)(i)(A) and\n52(b)(ii)(A)).  \n-----  18 A government may elect to disclose key fiscal aggregates (as defined) or other information additional to the\nrequirements of this Standard. If a government elects to make additional disclosures, they are made in a way\nthat does not detract from the information prescribed in this Standard.  \n18A Examples of additional disclosures that may be made voluntarily include the classification of other economic\n_flows consistent with Table 7.4 of the ABS publication Australian System of Government Finance Statistics:_\n_Concepts, Sources and Methods, 2005 (ABS Catalogue No. 5514.0) and additional key fiscal aggregates,_\nsuch as change in net worth due to revaluations and change in net worth due to other changes in the volume\nof assets.  \n18B Consistent with the requirements in paragraph 16 of this Standard, additional key fiscal aggregates are\nmeasured in a manner consistent with recognised amounts. Consistent with paragraphs 41(a)(i) and 52(b)(ii)\nof this Standard, where they differ, corresponding key fiscal aggregates measured in accordance with the ABS\nGFS Manual are disclosed, together with a reconciliation of the two measures of each key fiscal aggregate.  \n18C Fiscal aggregates that are not measured in a manner consistent with recognised amounts or the ABS GFS\nManual may be disclosed, but are not presented as key fiscal aggregates.  \n18D If a government elects to disclose aggregates that are not key fiscal aggregates, they are made in a way that\nclearly differentiates them from key fiscal aggregates.",

Accordingly, dividends are\nclassified as transactions and the remainder is classified as other economic flows. Such\ndividends are not included in the line item that includes dividends from entities other\nthan associates;  \n(ii) changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value, that do not arise\nfrom undistributed interest or dividends, are classified as other economic flows,\nirrespective of whether the instruments are classified as \u2018fair value through profit or loss\u2019\nor \u2018available-for-sale\u2019;  \n(iii) remeasurements of the defined benefit liability (asset) relating to defined benefit\nsuperannuation plans are classified as other economic flows;  \n(iv) changes in the fair value of investment property potentially comprise two components\nunder GFS classification \u2013 consumption of capital and price changes. Accordingly, the\nexpense arising from consumption of capital is classified as transactions and the gains\nand losses arising from price changes are classified as other economic flows. Although\nthe consumption of capital may be considered to be similar in nature to depreciation, it\nis not included in the line item that includes depreciation; and  \n(v) bad debts expense is classified as transactions to the extent it is mutually agreed,\notherwise it is classified as other economic flows; and  \n-----  (b) in both a whole of government and GGS financial reporting context, where GAAP recognises an\nitem that GFS does not recognise in the reporting period:  \n(i) income that arises from the amortisation of a prepayment received for a licence involving\nthe licensee having rights over a specified period of time (that GFS treated in a previous\nperiod as a sale of intangible asset) is classified as transactions, by analogy with the GFS\nclassification of the amortisation of a prepayment received for a service to be rendered;  \n(ii) doubtful debts expense that arises from the impairment of loans and receivables is\nclassified as other economic flows, by analogy with the GFS classification of revaluation\nof financial assets;  \n(iii) an expense that arises from the initial recognition of the difference between the fair value\nof a concessionary loan and the transaction price (the loan proceeds) is classified as\ntransactions, by analogy with the GFS classification of subsidies; and  \n(iv) an expense that arises from the initial recognition of a provision for decommissioning\ncosts for which there is no counterparty that recognises a related financial asset is\nclassified as transactions, by analogy with the GFS classification of an expense arising\nfrom the initial recognition of a liability. Subsequent changes in the measurement of\nsuch provisions arising from changes in estimates of the expenditure required to settle\nthe present obligation are classified as other economic flows, by analogy with the GFS\nclassification of revaluation of liabilities; and  \n(c) in a GGS financial reporting context, dividends from PNFC sector and PFC sector entities are\nclassified as transactions to the extent the ABS GFS Manual accounts for them as dividends and\notherwise as other economic flows.  \nIn some cases the approach in paragraphs 30 and 30A facilitates the reduction of differences between GAAP\nand GFS, particularly at the key fiscal aggregate level. Illustrative Examples A and B illustrate the\nclassification between transactions and other economic flows for some of the items listed above and other\npossible circumstances where items recognised in the whole of government statement of comprehensive\nincome and the GGS statement of comprehensive income do not have GFS equivalents.  \n**32** **The following shall be presented in the whole of government statement of comprehensive income and**\n**the GGS statement of comprehensive income:**  \n**(a)** **_net operating balance;_**  \n**(b)** **total change in net worth (before transactions with owners in their capacity as owners, where**\n**they exist); and**  \n**(c)** **_net lending/(borrowing) and its derivation from net operating balance;_**  \n**measured in a manner consistent with other amounts recognised in the respective statements of**\n**comprehensive income.**  \n33 Under AASB 101, an entity may present a single statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,\nwith profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented in two sections. The sections shall be presented\ntogether, with the profit or loss section presented first followed directly by the other comprehensive income\nsection. An entity may present the profit or loss section in a separate statement of profit or loss. If so, the\nseparate statement of profit or loss shall immediately precede the statement presenting comprehensive\nincome. This Standard requires a single statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income option\nto be adopted, and therefore requires all recognised income and expenses to be included in a single statement\nthat presents the comprehensive result (total change in net worth [before transactions with owners in their\ncapacity as owners, where they exist]).  \n34 [Deleted]",

Each difference gives rise to the need for\ndisclosure of a reconciliation and an explanation of the difference. Examples of such differences include:  \n(a) in a whole of government and GGS context:  \n(i) doubtful debts \u2013 although the ABS GFS Manual recognises bad debts written off, it does\nnot recognise write-downs of accounts receivable in relation to doubtful debts;  \n(ii) provisions recognised as liabilities \u2013 in the absence of a counter-party recognising a\nrelated financial asset, the ABS GFS Manual does not recognise a liability arising from\na constructive obligation;  \n(iii) inventories \u2013 under the ABS GFS Manual, inventories are measured at current prices,\nwhereas under AASB 102 _Inventories_ (as amended by AASB 2007-5 Amendments to  \n-----  _Australian Accounting Standard \u2013 Inventories Held for Distribution by Not-for-Profit_\n_Entities), depending on their nature, inventories are measured at the lower of cost and_\nnet realisable value or at cost adjusted when applicable for any loss of service potential;\nand  \n(iv) investments in associates \u2013 under the ABS GFS Manual, those assets are measured at\ncurrent prices where current prices exist, whereas under AASB 128 _Investments in_\n_Associates the equity method of accounting generally applies; and_  \n(b) in a whole of government context only:  \n(i) non-controlling interest in controlled entities \u2013 under the ABS GFS Manual, minority\ninterest is classified as a liability and measured at current prices, whereas under AASB 10\nnon-controlling interest that is classified as equity is not remeasured; and  \n(ii) outgoing dividends \u2013 under the ABS GFS Manual, outgoing dividends are classified as\nan expense, whereas under AASB 101 a dividend is treated as a distribution to owners.  \nIllustrative Examples A and B illustrate some of these and other possible circumstances where differences\narise and the manner in which they are reflected in reconciliation notes.  \n43 In relation to the whole of government, for the purpose of paragraph 41(a)(i)(A), the ABS GFS Manual key\nfiscal aggregate that corresponds to the requirement in paragraph 32(b) to present \u2018total change in net worth\nbefore transactions with owners in their capacity as owners\u2019 is \u2018total change in net worth\u2019 (after transactions\nwith owners in their capacity as owners). Accordingly, the reconciliation required to be disclosed for the\nwhole of government by paragraph 41(a)(i)(B) is from \u2018total change in net worth before transactions with\nowners in their capacity as owners\u2019 as presented in accordance with paragraph 32(b) to \u2018total change in net\nworth\u2019 measured in accordance with the ABS GFS Manual. As noted in paragraph 34B, transactions with\nowners in their capacity as owners do not arise in a GGS context.  \n44 Some differences between GAAP and GFS requirements relate to differences in classification or differences\nin consolidation eliminations that do not cause a difference in measurements of key fiscal aggregates and\ntherefore do not need to be included in the reconciliation notes. However, they do give rise to the need for\nexplanations of the differences to be disclosed. Examples of such differences include:  \n(a) for both the whole of government and the GGS:  \n(i) AASB 132 _Financial Instruments: Presentation classifies certain prepaid expenses as_\nnon-financial assets, whereas the ABS GFS Manual classifies them as financial assets;  \n(ii) AASB 137 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets_ may classify an\namount within provisions, whereas the ABS GFS Manual classifies them as accounts\npayable; and  \n(iii) paragraph 31(a)(iv) of this Standard notes that consumption of capital of investment\nproperty is classified separately from depreciation, whereas the ABS GFS Manual\nclassifies it as depreciation; and  \n(b) for the whole of government, consolidation eliminations. Under the ABS GFS Manual, certain\ntransactions between the GGS and entities within the PNFC sector and PFC sector are not\neliminated on whole of government consolidation, whereas under AASB 10 intragroup transactions\nthat are not, in substance, transactions with external parties are eliminated in full. The GFS\ntreatment has the effect of \u2018grossing up\u2019 both GFS revenue and GFS expenses by equal amounts\nand though the key fiscal aggregates remain the same, the differences in GAAP and GFS revenues\nand expenses should be disclosed. For example, a GGS may compensate a PNFC sector entity for\na community service obligation, imposed by the GGS, that requires the PNFC sector entity to\nprovide free services to a cohort of private individuals. The compensation provided by the GGS to\nthe PNFC sector entity is not eliminated for whole of government reporting under the ABS GFS\nManual (instead it is \u2018rerouted\u2019 through the household sector of the economy and therefore treated\nas an expense of the GGS to the household sector, and an expense of the household sector to the\nPNFC sector entity, and therefore revenue of the PNFC sector entity).  \n45 The GGS is not subject to the disclosures required by AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. The\nrequirements in AASB 12 are either addressed elsewhere in this Standard or are not significant for GGS\nfinancial reporting.  \n46 In relation to the requirement in paragraph 41(a)(iii) to disclose explanations of key technical terms, key\ntechnical terms include:  \n(a) transactions;  \n(b) other economic flows;  \n-----  (c) net operating balance;  \n(d) net lending/(borrowing);  \n(e) financial assets;  \n(f) non-financial assets;  \n(g) net worth;  \n(h) cash surplus/(deficit);  \n(i) operating result;  \n(j) comprehensive result (total change in net worth [before transactions with owners in their capacity\nas owners]);  \n(k) total change in net worth; and  \n(l) net debt.  \nAn example of the disclosures required by paragraph 41(a)(iii) is provided in Illustrative Example D.  \n47 Paragraph 112 of AASB 101 requires additional information to be provided in notes that is not presented in\nthe statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and\nstatement of cash flows but is relevant to an understanding of them. Consistent with this, the components of\naggregate numbers presented in those statements, including key fiscal aggregates, are disclosed in the notes\nwhere relevant.",

        "page_content=": "### GFS manual; and  \n**(iii)** **where the key fiscal aggregates measured in accordance with the ABS GFS Manual**\n**do not differ from the key fiscal aggregates determined in a manner consistent with**\n**paragraph 16, a statement of that fact; and**  \n**(c)** **a reconciliation between the information disclosed for the sectors in total and the**\n**corresponding information in the whole of government\u2019s statement of financial position,**\n**statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash**\n**flows (see, for example, Illustrative Example A).**  \n53 Sector information prepared in accordance with paragraph 52(b) is determined before consolidation\neliminations. Accordingly, GGS investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities are included in the GGS\ninformation that is disclosed for the whole of government. They are measured at the carrying amount of net\nassets disclosed by the whole of government for the PNFC sector and PFC sector.  \n54 Notes to the sector statements of financial position, statements of comprehensive income, statements of\nchanges in equity and statements of cash flows, other than those required by paragraph 52, are not required\nto be disclosed.  \n55 In relation to the requirements in paragraph 52(b)(ii), differences in the key fiscal aggregates determined\nunder the ABS GFS Manual and consistent with paragraph 16 of this Standard arise from differences in\ndefinition, recognition, measurement and certain classification requirements. Each difference gives rise to\nthe need for disclosure of a reconciliation and an explanation of the difference. Examples of such differences\nfor the PNFC sector and the PFC sector include those identified in paragraph 42 of this Standard, as well as:  \n(a) ownership interest in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities \u2013 in contrast to Australian Accounting\nStandards, under the ABS GFS Manual, the carrying amount of ownership interest in PNFC sector\nand PFC sector entities is deducted in the determination of net worth of those sectors. In particular:  \n(i) where the market value of ownership interest in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities is\nreliably measurable, GFS deducts it in determining net worth of those sectors.\nAccordingly, negative GFS net worth arises if the market value exceeds the recognised\ncarrying amount of net assets. Under Australian Accounting Standards, the market value\nof ownership interest is not recognised; and  \n(ii) where ownership interest in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities is measured by GFS at\nthe carrying amount of net assets, GFS net worth is nil. Under Australian Accounting\nStandards, the carrying amount of net assets is not deducted in determining net worth;\nand  \n(b) deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of PNFC sector and PFC sector entities \u2013 the ABS\nGFS Manual does not recognise deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities that are recognised\nby PNFC sector and PFC sector entities in accordance with AASB 112 Income Taxes. Like the\napproach in paragraph 61A of AASB 112, a deferred tax revenue or expense recognised in\naccordance with AASB 112 is classified in the statement of comprehensive income as a transaction\nor an other economic flow consistent with the underlying event giving rise to the related deferred\ntax asset or liability. For example, when a deferred tax liability arises from the revaluation of an\nasset, the related deferred tax expense is classified as an other economic flow because the asset\nrevaluation itself is recognised as an other economic flow.  \n-----  56 For the purpose of paragraph 52(b)(ii)(A), the ABS GFS Manual key fiscal aggregate that corresponds to the\nrequirement implicit in paragraph 52(b)(i) to present \u2018total change in net worth before transactions with\nowners in their capacity as owners\u2019 for the PNFC sector and PFC sector is \u2018total change in net worth\u2019 (after\ntransactions with owners in their capacity as owners). Accordingly, the reconciliation required to be disclosed\nby paragraph 52(b)(ii)(B) is from \u2018total change in net worth before transactions with owners in their capacity\nas owners\u2019 as presented in accordance with paragraph 52(b)(i) to \u2018total change in net worth\u2019 measured in\naccordance with the ABS GFS Manual.  \n57 A government may choose to disclose sectors in addition to the GGS, PNFC sector and PFC sector. For\nexample, a government may disclose information about the total non-financial public sector, comprising the\nGGS and PNFC sector. Where that is the case, the additional sectors are disclosed on a comparable basis to\nthe information disclosed for the GGS, PNFC sector and PFC sector.  \n58 The sector statements of financial position, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in\nequity and statements of cash flows could be presented in a single schedule that includes an adjustments\ncolumn or row to facilitate reconciliation to the corresponding whole of government statements in accordance\nwith paragraph 52(c). Alternatively, those sector financial statements may be presented in columns, with or\nwithout an adjustments column, in the whole of government statement of financial position, statement of\ncomprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows. Where an adjustments\ncolumn is not provided in those whole of government financial statements, the reconciliation required by\nparagraph 52(c) is provided in the notes. Disclosure of the individual eliminations between the sectors is not\nrequired.  \n-----  ",

However, the\ndevelopment costs are not recognised as expenses from transactions in the statement of comprehensive\nincome because they are recognised as intangible assets upon acquisition. GFS treats goods and services used\nfor research and development as use of goods and services expenses from transactions, rather than as\nacquisitions of intangible assets, even though some development activities are expected to bring benefits for\nmore than one year (refer also to Note (b)).  \nThe total difference of ($86m) flows through to the whole of government amounts.  \n**b** **Expenses from Transactions \u2013 Depreciation**  \nThe convergence difference of $6m in the GGS and $5m in the PNFC sector arises because GFS recognises\na smaller amortisation of produced intangibles than is recognised as an expense from transactions in the\nstatement of comprehensive income. GFS treats goods and services used for research and development as\nuse of goods and services expense from transactions, rather than as acquisitions of intangible assets, even\nthough some development activities may bring benefits for more than one year (refer also to Note (a)).  \nThe total difference of $11m flows through to the whole of government amounts.  \n**c** **Expenses from Transactions \u2013 Social Benefits**  \nThe convergence difference of $94m in the GGS arises because GFS does not recognise a liability relating to\nthe potential beneficiaries of a social benefit scheme who had not registered for benefits as at the reporting\ndate. Therefore, GFS does not recognise the associated expense from transactions, whereas such an amount\nis recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and classified as expenses from transactions.  \nThis difference flows through to the whole of government amounts.  \n**d** **Dividends to GGS from Other Sector Entities**  \nThe convergence difference comprises ($259m) in the PNFC sector and ($789m) in the PFC sector because\nGFS treats dividends to owners as an expense, whereas such an amount is not recognised as an expense in the\nstatement of comprehensive income because it is treated as a distribution to owners and therefore a direct\ndebit to equity.  \nThe total difference of ($1,048m) does not flow through to the whole of government amounts as it arises from\nintersector transactions.  \n**e** **Other Differences Included in the GFS Net Operating Balance**  \nA classification difference arises in the whole of government and the GGS, because GFS classifies the debt\nsecurity written off by mutual agreement of $380m as a capital grant expense from transactions, whereas,\nalthough it is recognised as an expense from transactions in the statement of comprehensive income, it is\nclassified as loss on write-off of financial assets at fair value through operating result. [For the purpose of\nIllustrative Examples A and B, the debt security is assumed to have satisfied the criteria in AASB 9 Financial\n_Instruments for classification as a \u2018fair value through profit or loss\u2019 financial asset.] The write-off arose from_\nthe Government agreeing to forgive the outstanding debt of a Country. The classification difference has no\nimpact on the amount of the GFS Net Operating Balance.  \nA GGS/PNFC elimination difference arises in respect of the treatment of $25m of the social benefits. Under\nGFS, certain transactions between the GGS and entities within the PNFC and PFC sectors are not eliminated  \n-----  on consolidation, whereas under AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements intragroup transactions that\nare not in substance transactions with external parties are eliminated in full. The GFS treatment has the effect\nof \u2018grossing up\u2019 both GFS \u2018revenue from transactions \u2013 other current revenues\u2019 and GFS \u2018expenses from\ntransactions \u2013 grants\u2019 of the whole of government by equal amounts even though the key fiscal aggregates\nremain the same. [For the purpose of this illustration, it is assumed the GGS has compensated a PNFC entity\nfor $25m of community service obligations, imposed by the GGS, that requires the PNFC entity to provide\nfree services to a cohort of private individuals.] The compensation provided by the GGS to the PNFC entity\nis not eliminated under GFS (instead it is \u2018rerouted\u2019 through the household sector of the economy and\ntherefore treated as an expense of the GGS to the household sector, and an expense of the household sector\nto the PNFC entity and therefore revenue of the PNFC entity). This convergence difference has no impact\non the amount of the whole of government\u2019s GFS Net Operating Balance. This difference does not affect the\nGGS or the PNFC and PFC sectors but impacts the total of revenues and expenses in the whole of government\nstatement of comprehensive income.",

Under GFS, the holding gain on other sector entities is\ndetermined after taking into account additions to and withdrawals from equity that have occurred.  \nThe total difference of $390m does not flow through to the whole of government amounts as it arises from\nintersector items.  \n-----  **j** **Other Economic Flows \u2013 Included in Operating Result \u2013 Share of Net Profit/(Loss) from Associates**\n**(Excluding Dividends)**  \nThe convergence difference of $51m arises in the GGS because GFS does not recognise the share of the\nassociate\u2019s loss (excluding dividends), whereas consistent with the equity method of accounting, it is\nrecognised as an expense of $51m and classified as an other economic flow and dividends are recognised as\na revenue of $1m and classified as a transaction in the statement of comprehensive income. GFS recognises\nthe decrease in the market value of investments in associates of $55m as an other economic flow (refer to\nNote k(ii)), and the dividends on such investments of $1m as dividend revenue from transactions.  \nThis difference flows through to the whole of government amounts.  \n**k** **Other Economic Flows \u2013 Other Comprehensive Income \u2013 Revaluations**  \nThe convergence differences comprise:  \n**k(i)** ($55m) in the GGS because GFS recognises the decrease in the market value of investments in associates of\n$55m as an other economic flow, whereas it is not recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\nConsistent with the equity method of accounting, the statement of comprehensive income recognises the share\nof the associate\u2019s loss of $50m as a loss of $51m classified as other economic flows and revenue (from\ndividends) of $1m (refer also to Note j).  \nThis difference flows through to the whole of government amounts.  \n**k(ii)** $130m in the GGS and $12m in the PNFC sector because GFS recognises the net increase in the revalued\nintangible assets as an other economic flow, whereas it is not recognised in the statement of comprehensive\nincome.

Because\nin Illustrative Example A PNFC and PFC sectors are 100 per cent owned by the GGS, the GFS net worth,\nand therefore the GFS change in net worth, of these sectors is zero.

Under the tax regime assumed for the purpose of this example, the GGS, as the tax_\ncollector, does not recognise deferred tax balances because the tax events associated with the PNFC sector\u2019s\ndeferred tax balances have not occurred, even though from the PNFC sector\u2019s viewpoint, the event is the\nrecognition of the underlying assets and/or liabilities in accordance with AASB 112 _Income Taxes.

This example assumes that the GGS\nfinancial statements are presented separately from the whole of government financial statements, and that the most\nrecent version of the ABS GFS Manual has been applied.  \nThe financial statements of the General Government Sector (GGS) of [name of the Government] have been prepared in\naccordance with AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting, which_\nrequires compliance with all Australian Accounting Standards except those identified below. The purpose of the\nfinancial statements is to provide users with information about the stewardship by the Government in relation to its GGS\nand accountability for the resources entrusted to it; information about the financial position, changes in net\nassets/(liabilities), performance and cash flows of the Government\u2019s GGS; and information that facilitates assessments\nof the macro-economic impact of the Government\u2019s GGS.  \nThe GGS of [name of the Government] is a component of the Whole of Government of [name of the Government]. The\nGGS is determined in accordance with the principles and rules contained in the Australian Bureau of Statistics\npublications:  \n(a) _Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods, 2005 (ABS Catalogue_\nNo. 5514.0); and  \n(b) _Amendments to Australian System of Government Finance Statistics, 2005 (ABS Catalogue No. 5514.0)_  \npublished on the ABS website on _[publication date, or refer to effective date if specified by the ABS] (ABS GFS_\nManual). The GGS consists of all government units and non-profit institutions controlled and mainly financed by\ngovernment. Government units are legal entities established by political processes that have legislative, judicial, or\nexecutive authority over other units and which provide goods and services to the community or to individuals on a nonmarket basis; and make transfer payments to redistribute income and wealth. Non-profit institutions are created for the\npurpose of producing or distributing goods and services but are not a source of income, profit or other financial gain for\nthe government.  \nThe Standard under which the GGS financial statements are prepared does not require full application of AASB 10\n_Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 9 Financial Instruments. Assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash_\nflows of government controlled entities that are in the Public Non-Financial Corporations sector and the Public Financial\nCorporations sector are not separately recognised in the GGS of _[name of the Government\u2019s] financial statements._\nInstead, the GGS financial statements recognise an asset, being the controlling equity investment in those entities, and\nrecognise a gain or loss relating to changes in the carrying amount of that asset, measured in accordance with\nAASB 1049. Readers are referred to the Whole of Government general purpose financial statements of [name of the\n_Government] for the year ended 30 June 20XX for financial information that separately recognises assets, liabilities,_\nincome, expenses and cash flows of all entities under the control of the [name of the Government].  \nThe ABS GFS Manual also provides the basis upon which Government Finance Statistics (GFS) information that is\ncontained in the financial statements is prepared. In particular, notes disclosing key fiscal aggregates of net worth, net\noperating balance, total change in net worth, net lending/(borrowing) and cash surplus/(deficit) determined using the\nprinciples and rules in the ABS GFS Manual are included in the financial statements, together with a reconciliation of\nthose key fiscal aggregates to the corresponding key fiscal aggregates recognised in the financial statements.  \n-----  ",

This Basis for Conclusions summarises_\nthe Board\u2019s considerations in developing the Standard. It focuses on the issues that the Board considers to be\nof greatest significance.  \nBC2 In developing the Standard, the Board first considered GAAP/GFS harmonisation issues from a General\nGovernment Sector (GGS) perspective. This resulted in the issue of AASB 1049 _Financial Reporting of_\n_General Government Sectors by Governments_ in September 2006. It included a requirement that a\ngovernment not make its GGS financial report available prior to its whole of government financial report\nbeing made available. The Board became aware that no jurisdiction intended to early adopt AASB 1049\n(September 2006) because of this requirement, combined with concern that the whole of government\naccounting basis (then specified in AAS 31 Financial Reporting by Governments) was, at the time, different\nfrom the GGS accounting basis (specified in AASB 1049).  \nBC3 In addressing this concern, the Board considered the extent to which the principles in AASB 1049 (September\n2006) should apply to whole of government financial reporting. The Board concluded that the requirements\nfor GAAP/GFS harmonised whole of government financial reports, incorporating requirements for\ninformation about the GGS, the Public Non-Financial Corporations (PNFC) sector and the Public Financial\nCorporations (PFC) sector, should be based on the principles in AASB 1049 (September 2006). This reflects\nthe relationship between the GGS of a government, the other sectors of a government and the whole of\ngovernment and is a response to an assessment of user needs. Given the relationship between the GGS and\nwhole of government, an alternative approach that would result in fundamentally different accounting bases\nfor GGS financial reports and whole of government financial reports has the potential to confuse some users.  \nBC4 The Board developed a separate Exposure Draft (ED 155 Financial Reporting by Whole of Governments) for\nthe purpose of exposing its proposals for GAAP/GFS harmonisation requirements for whole of government\nfinancial reporting, rather than present the proposals integrated with the requirements in AASB 1049\n(September 2006). However, the Board indicated its intention in ED 155 that the Standard to be developed\nwould be an amended AASB 1049 that specifies, in an integrated way, the GAAP/GFS harmonised\nrequirements for GGS financial reports and whole of government financial reports. The Board concluded\nthat a single integrated Standard is justified on the basis that:  \n(a) it more effectively acknowledges the strong relationship between whole of government financial\nreports and GGS financial reports. An integrated Standard is consistent with the requirement that\nGGS financial reports not be made available prior to the release of whole of government financial\nreports (see paragraphs BC18-BC20);  \n(b) it is more consistent with a topic-based approach to setting Standards; and  \n(c) it imposes a greater discipline on the Board to ensure that the requirements are expressed in the\nsame way for GGS and whole of government, and only differ where intended.",

        "page_content=": "### GGS financial report prepared on a partial consolidation basis\nBC7 It is inherent in the definition of a GGS that government controlled entities within the PNFC sector and PFC\nsector are not consolidated in the GGS financial report (see paragraphs BC11-BC13). Only government\ncontrolled entities that fall within the boundary of a GGS are consolidated. Accordingly, the Board concluded\nthat a government should produce a GGS financial report on a partial consolidation basis (see paragraph 19).  \nBC8 This focus on the GGS and consequently the partial consolidation approach is consistent with, to some extent,\nthe \u2018through the eyes of management\u2019 approach adopted in AASB 8 Operating Segments. The information\nused to manage a government includes GGS information prepared on a partial consolidated basis because,\nessentially, the GGS equates to the budget sector of Australian governments, and reporting of budget\noutcomes is a major focus.  \nBC9 The Board\u2019s decisions reflect that:  \n(a) the GGS is a significant sector of a government that warrants prominence in financial reporting;  \n(b) GGS financial information is relevant to users and is widely distributed;  \n(c) GGS financial information should be made available to the public in a manner that meets the key\ncharacteristics of comparability, understandability, relevance, reliability and timeliness set out in\nAASB Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements; and  \n(d) GGS financial information is necessary to provide a link to GGS budgets, which are a means by\nwhich governments outline their taxing policies and resource allocation decisions (see paragraphs\nBC57-BC62 ).  \nBC10 An alternative view considered by the Board is that, because a GGS is a sector of the whole of government,\nGGS financial information prepared on a partial consolidation basis should only be included in the whole of\ngovernment GPFR (see also paragraph BC20). When that GGS financial information is presented in a\nfinancial report that is separate from the whole of government GPFR, it should be characterised as a special\npurpose financial report. However, as explained in paragraph BC6, the Board decided that, because the\nStandard prescribes the form and content of the GGS financial report, it is not necessary to take such an\napproach.  \n**Accounting for GGS investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities in**",

        "page_content=": "### GGS financial reports [paragraphs 19 and 20]\nBC11 The issue of the accounting for GGS investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities in the GGS financial\nreport is closely related to the basis on which the GGS financial report is prepared and to the issue of partial\nconsolidation (see paragraphs BC7-BC10).  \nBC12 The Board decided that, consistent with GFS principles and rules, entities that are controlled by a government,\nbut are not part of the GGS of the government, should be recognised in the GGS financial report as\ninvestments.  \nBC13 Furthermore, the Board concluded that GGS controlling investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities\nshould be measured at, depending on circumstances, fair value, the government\u2019s proportional share of the\ncarrying amount of net assets (as a surrogate for fair value) or zero. Measurement at fair value, or at the\ngovernment\u2019s proportional share of the carrying amount of net assets where fair value is not reliably\nmeasurable, is consistent with GFS. Not allowing investments to be measured below zero is consistent with\nthe principles elsewhere in GAAP (for example, AASB 128 Investments in Associates does not allow negative\ninvestment values when using the equity method).  \nBC14 When a GGS\u2019s controlling investment in a PNFC sector or PFC sector entity is measured at the government\u2019s\nproportional share of the carrying amount of net assets, for consistency with GFS principles, it should be\naccounted for as a financial asset consistent with AASB 139 _Financial Instruments: Recognition and_\n_Measurement, rather than as if it were an investment in an associate accounted for using the equity method_\nof accounting.  \n-----  **Accounting for GGS investments in jointly controlled entities and associates**\n**in GGS financial reports [paragraph 24]**  \nBC15 The Board concluded that investments in jointly controlled entities and associates should be measured using\nthe equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale in accordance with\nAASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. This is on the basis that, consistent\nwith paragraph 19 of this Standard that prescribes the use of the consolidation procedures in AASB 127\n_Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, the GGS financial report is treated as if it is a consolidated_\nfinancial report rather than as \u2018separate financial statements\u2019, as defined in AASB 127.  \n**Disclosures about the GGS in the summary of significant accounting policies**\n**note [paragraph 39(b)]**  \nBC16 The Board concluded that additional disclosures relating to the nature of the GGS and its relationship to the\nwhole of government financial report should be made as part of the note in the GGS financial report containing\nthe summary of significant accounting policies. These disclosures are intended to help overcome concerns\nthat users might perceive the GGS financial report as being a substitute for the whole of government financial\nreport. Furthermore, the disclosures are intended to help users understand the nature of the GGS and its\nfinancial reports to provide a greater link to the budget outcome reports, to the extent they focus solely on the\nGGS.",

        "page_content=": "### Other disclosures specific to the GGS [paragraph 41(b)]\nBC17 Given this Standard encompasses GFS concepts and definitions for the GGS, the Board considered it\nappropriate to require additional disclosures to be included in the GGS financial report. The additional\ndisclosures include:  \n(a) a list of entities within the GGS and any changes to that list since the previous reporting date and\nreasons for the changes (paragraph 41(b)(i)). This disclosure informs users of the controlled entities\nthat have been consolidated into the GGS financial report and, for the purposes of year to year\ncomparisons, the changes to the list of entities. The reasons for changes should be capable of being\ntraced back to the ABS GFS Manual definition of the GGS and should reflect a fundamental change\nto the nature of an entity\u2019s functions and purpose;  \n(b) a list of significant investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities (paragraph 41(b)(ii)). This\ndisclosure informs users of the controlled entities that have not been consolidated into the GGS\nfinancial report and the effect of GGS management decisions to retain or divest these investments\nand their effect on the balance sheet of the GGS; and  \n(c) the aggregate amount of dividends and other distributions to owners as owners from PNFC sector\nand PFC sector entities to the GGS and the aggregate amount of the comprehensive result of the\nPNFC sector and PFC sector entities that is attributable to the GGS for the reporting period\n(paragraph 41(b)(iii)). This disclosure provides further information about the relationship between\nthe GGS and PNFC sector and PFC sector entities.  \n_Relationship between GGS financial reports and whole of government financial_\n_reports [paragraphs 8 and 39(b)(iv)]_  \nBC18 As noted in paragraph BC2, the Board concluded that, because of the relationship between the GGS (partially\nconsolidated) financial report and the whole of government (fully consolidated) financial report, the GGS\nfinancial report should not be made available prior to the whole of government financial report being made\navailable. Furthermore, the GGS financial report should include a cross-reference to the whole of government\nfinancial report (see paragraph 39(b)(iv)). This approach ensures that GGS financial reports are given due\nprominence within an appropriate context. That context is the whole of government financial reports that\nprovide information about all the resources controlled by the government.  \nBC19 Board consultations indicated that most jurisdictions would be able to meet the requirement for the whole of\ngovernment financial report to be available at the time the GGS financial report is prepared in the short term.\nOne jurisdiction faced a number of impediments, including legislative provisions, to achieving completion of\nthe whole of government financial report at the same time as a GGS financial report could be prepared. The\nBoard therefore decided to specify a mandatory operative date for the Standard of the year beginning\n1 July 2008, and to allow early adoption (see paragraphs 3 and 4). The Board\u2019s decision not to permit the\npreparation and presentation of GGS financial reports at an earlier date than for the whole of government\nfinancial report is consistent, by analogy, with the requirements in AASB 127 that parent entity financial\nreports cannot be prepared and presented unless consolidated financial statements are available.  \n-----  BC20 Prior to this Standard, Australian Accounting Standards only anticipated that sectors of a whole of government\n(including the GGS) might be disclosed in the whole of government financial report in the form of\ndisaggregated information. That is, separate financial reporting of a GGS was not contemplated. The Board\nconsidered whether, consistent with this disaggregated information approach, the proposals in International\nPublic Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) Exposure Draft ED 28 _Disclosure of Financial_\n_Information about the General Government Sector, since reflected in IPSAS 22_ _Disclosure of Financial_\n_Information About the General Government Sector, should be adopted in Australia. When a government_\nelects to disclose information about its GGS in its whole of government financial reports, IPSAS 22 requires\nthe information to conform with the accounting policies of the whole of government financial report (which\nare not GAAP/GFS harmonised) except for consolidation requirements and the accounting for investments in\ncontrolled PNFC sector and PFC sector entities. The Board concluded that such an approach would not\nadequately facilitate the presentation of GGS information and GFS information with appropriate prominence.",

Since then, AAS 31 had only been subject to limited reviews, the most recent in June 1998.[1]\nThe Board considered it timely to undertake a comprehensive review of the requirements in AAS 31 through\ntwo concurrent and interrelated AASB projects:  \n(a) the GAAP/GFS Harmonisation project; and  \n(b) the Short-term Review of the Requirements in AAS 27 Financial Reporting by Local Governments,\nAAS 29 Financial Reporting by Government Departments and AAS 31 Financial Reporting by\n_Governments._  \nBC22 This Standard, which is a result of the GAAP/GFS Harmonisation project, together with the new, amending\nand revised Standards being developed from the Short-term Review of the Requirements in AASs 27, 29 &\n31, supersede AAS 31.  \nBC23 This Standard requires governments to prepare GPFRs that adopt applicable Australian Accounting\nStandards, except when otherwise specified (see paragraph 9).

However, a different kind of non-consolidation issue conceivably arises.

Under GFS, controlled nonresidents are not consolidated. For example, an off-shore subsidiary of a PNFC sector entity or PFC sector\nentity is not consolidated under GFS because it is not part of the Australian economic territory. Instead GFS\nrecords the parent PNFC sector or PFC sector entity as having an equity investment in the non-resident\nsubsidiary and deriving dividend income from it. The non-resident subsidiary is an institutional unit in the\neconomic territory of the other economy that would be part of that other economy\u2019s private sector.  \nBC27 The Board concluded that, consistent with AASB 127, all controlled entities should be consolidated on a lineby-line basis in whole of government financial reports. If material, the GFS non-consolidation of non-resident\nsubsidiaries would be shown as a reconciling difference (see paragraphs BC40(c) and BC52). The Board\nnoted that Australian jurisdictions either do not have non-resident subsidiaries or have immaterial nonresident subsidiaries. Given that the issue is not significant in practice, the Board concluded that it is not\nnecessary for the Standard to explicitly refer to the issue.",

The Board noted that this would\nin some respects broadly align with the \u2018through the eyes of management\u2019 approach adopted in AASB 8.\nHowever, the Board concluded that this approach should not be adopted because:  \n(a) sectors are different in nature from operating segments;  \n(b) such an approach would not be consistent with the approach to GAAP/GFS harmonisation adopted\nfor the GGS financial report; and  \n-----  (c) there would be a potential for user confusion if GGS financial reports adopt an accounting basis\nfundamentally different from that used for the GGS financial information presented in the whole\nof government financial report.  \nBC33 The Board also considered whether to not require disclosure of reconciliations of GAAP and GFS measures\nof key fiscal aggregates for the PNFC sector and PFC sector (see paragraph BC52), noting a view expressed\nby some that having to provide such information is onerous for preparers. The Board concluded that such\ninformation is useful for a significant group of users and therefore should be included in the whole of\ngovernment financial report.  \nBC34 The Board noted that a government may choose to present information about additional sectors, such as the\ntotal non-financial public sector (comprising the GGS and PNFC sector). The Board concluded that it is not\nnecessary to prescribe the disclosure of additional sectors, because the GGS, PNFC sector and PFC sector\ncomprise a comprehensive disaggregation of the whole of government. However, where a government elects\nto disclose information about additional sectors, this should be made on a comparable basis. This ensures\nthat information contained in the financial report is consistent.",

It therefore considered whether GGS investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities should\nbe disclosed, and how they should be measured (fair value, carrying amount of net assets or zero). The Board\nnoted that if a GGS investment in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities were to be measured at fair value in\nthe whole of government financial report\u2019s sector information disclosures, there would be a disconnect\nbetween that amount and the carrying amount of net assets disclosed for the PNFC sector and PFC sector.  \nBC36 The Board concluded that GGS investments in PNFC sector and PFC sector entities should be included in the\nsector information disclosures, and be measured at the carrying amount of net assets disclosed for the PNFC\nsector and PFC sector in the whole of government financial report. The Board notes that it is conceivable,\nalthough unlikely in practice, that information about the GGS investment in PNFC and PFC sectors in the\nGGS financial report might differ from the GGS financial information disclosed in the whole of government\nfinancial report. This is appropriate given the different contexts in which the two sets of GGS information\nare presented. GGS financial reports treat the GGS as akin to a separate reporting entity whereas the GGS\ninformation disclosed in whole of government financial reports treats the GGS as a sector of a reporting entity.",

        "page_content=": "## Issues common to whole of government financial reports and GGS financial reports  \nGAAP or GFS [paragraph 9]  \nBC37 The Board considered whether GAAP or GFS principles should prevail for financial reporting purposes. The\nBoard concluded that GAAP definition, recognition and measurement principles should be applied in\naccordance with other Australian Accounting Standards, unless otherwise specified, to accommodate GFS\nprinciples. In particular, in the interests of GAAP/GFS harmonisation, the Board concluded that GAAP\npresentation principles should be modified to accommodate GFS principles. Although this issue was\nconsidered in a GGS context, the Board concluded that there is no reason to adopt a different approach in a\nwhole of government context.  \nBC38 An alternative approach to adopting GAAP with limited exceptions would have been to decide, for the\npurposes of preparing financial reports, that the GFS framework should apply. Making that declaration in a\nStandard would mean that GFS would become part of GAAP. However, the Board formed the view that its\nobjective of promulgating an Australian Accounting Standard that provides useful information in a financial\nreporting context could be achieved without overriding entirely the GAAP framework. Accordingly, the\nBoard\u2019s starting point was the principles and framework of GAAP, and the Board concluded that to simply\nadopt GFS in the Standard would be an inappropriate approach. To have adopted the GFS framework and\nprinciples as the starting point for the development of a Standard within the GAAP context, would have\nrequired the Board to become closely involved with all elements of the GFS framework. This would include\nany ongoing changes to the GFS framework, over which the Board has no control.  \nBC39 The Board\u2019s decision to adopt GAAP with limited exceptions was made on the basis that the accounting\nprescribed under Australian Accounting Standards is appropriate for events that occur within the not-forprofit sector, including the government. The Board noted that, in developing those Australian Accounting\nStandards, where the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) upon which the Standards are based  \n-----  do not sufficiently deal with not-for-profit circumstances, Aus paragraphs have been or will be inserted by\nthe Board or separate Standards have been or will be issued to deal with those circumstances.  \nBC40 The Board\u2019s conclusion facilitates GAAP/GFS harmonisation for whole of government financial reports and\nGGS financial reports by:  \n(a) amending presentation requirements to encompass a comprehensive operating statement\n(paragraphs 29 and 52(b)(i)) that retains the GAAP classification system but overlays it with a\ntransactions/other economic flows classification system based on GFS (paragraphs 30 and\n52(b)(i));  \n(b) expanding disclosure requirements to accommodate, on the face of the statements, key fiscal\naggregates under GFS (paragraphs 28, 32, 37 and 52(b)(i)) and the distinction between cash flows\nrelating to investing in financial assets for policy purposes and for liquidity management purposes\nadopted by GFS (paragraphs 36 and 52(b)(i)); and  \n(c) specifying supplementary disclosure requirements, including GFS measures of key fiscal\naggregates, reconciliations between GAAP and GFS measures of key fiscal aggregates and\nexplanations of differences between GAAP and GFS (paragraphs 41 and 52) \u2013 (see paragraphs\nBC48-BC53).  \nBC41 The Board decided to utilise the GFS principles related to the distinction between transactions and other\neconomic flows for presentation purposes in the operating statement as it facilitates GAAP/GFS\nharmonisation in a number of areas \u2013 especially at the key fiscal aggregates level. The Board formed the\nview that applying the GFS principles in this way is possible without breaching the principles of GAAP\nbecause the GAAP classification system has been retained but overlayed with the GFS classification system.\nFurthermore, GAAP disclosure requirements have been retained.  \nBC42 In a whole of government context, including the disclosure of information about the PNFC sector and PFC\nsector, the Board considered the manner in which transactions with owners as owners should be treated. It\nconcluded that, because they are different in nature from amounts recognised on the face of the operating\nstatement, such transactions should be disclosed in the notes or a separate statement. However, consistent\nwith AASB 1049 (September 2006) and paragraph 97(b) and (c) of AASB 101 _Presentation of Financial_\n_Statements, and subject to paragraph 93B of AASB 119 Employee Benefits, movements in reserves should be_\ndisclosed in notes, on the face of the operating statement or in a separate statement.",

It did so, notwithstanding the context of international harmonisation, on_\nthe basis that:  \n(a) the ABS has a similar role to the role that the Board plays for GAAP.

Although this issue was considered in a GGS context, the Board concluded that there is no reason\nto adopt a different approach in a whole of government context. These aggregates reflect some of the\nreporting features of the GFS system by including indicators of the macro-economic impact of a particular\ngovernment\u2019s policy decisions on the economy as a whole, and its overall financing impact on capital markets.\nThese GFS aggregates are important to an understanding of a GGS and a whole of government (including its\nsectors) and therefore they should be displayed with an appropriate level of prominence in the financial\nreports.  \nBC49 The Board concluded that the key fiscal aggregates should be measured in a manner consistent with other\namounts recognised on the face of the financial statements. The Board was mindful of the potential distortion\nof what might be regarded by some as \u2018pure GFS\u2019 measures of key fiscal aggregates. Nevertheless, the Board\nconsidered that the approach adopted increases understanding as to the manner in which the key fiscal\naggregates are derived and interconnected with the existing GAAP concepts.  \nBC50 Depending on the jurisdiction concerned, it is possible that the measurement differences will not be of great\nsignificance, and the Board expects that, over time, several of the measurement differences will be resolved.\nIn any event, measurement differences are included in the reconciliations and explanations required by\nparagraphs 41(a)(i)(B) and 52(b)(ii)(B) (see paragraph BC52).  \nBC51 The Board also noted some concerns about the GFS nomenclature being used to describe the key fiscal\naggregates. Despite these concerns, the same GFS nomenclature has been retained on the basis that to do\notherwise would require the introduction of further definitions and terminology that could cause confusion\nfor users. This approach is consistent with the Board\u2019s expectation that, over time, several of the differences\nwill be resolved. The Board further noted that GAAP and GFS already share other terminology, such as\nassets and depreciation, despite being subject to different definition, recognition and measurement\nrequirements.  \nBC52 Following the Board\u2019s decision to require the presentation of the key fiscal aggregates on the face of the\nfinancial statements, the Board also concluded that it is appropriate to stipulate certain disclosure\nrequirements. Where the key fiscal aggregates presented on the face of the financial statements differ from\nthose measured in accordance with the ABS GFS Manual, a reconciliation of the two measures and/or an\nexplanation of the differences is required to be disclosed so that users are informed about the relationship\nbetween GAAP and GFS.  \nBC53 The level of prominence of these disclosures is not prescribed in the Standard.",

The direction is,\namong other things, to achieve an Australian Accounting Standard \u201c\u2026 in which the outcome statements are\ndirectly comparable with the relevant budget statements\u201d.  \nBC58 The Board concluded that the Standard should require disclosure of certain budgetary information where\nbudgetary information is presented to parliament, including the original budgeted financial statements. The\nBoard also concluded that explanations of major variances between the actual amounts presented on the face\nof the financial statements and corresponding budget amounts should be disclosed. Although this issue was\nconsidered in a GGS context, the Board concluded that there is no reason to adopt a different approach in a\nwhole of government context. In doing so, the Board noted that Australian Accounting Standards, including\nthis Standard, do not prescribe the preparation of a budget. The Board also noted that governments typically\nbudget on a GGS basis rather than on a whole of government basis.  \nBC59 The Board concluded that the \u2018presented\u2019 budget is more relevant to users than the \u2018adopted\u2019 budget. The\npresented budget is the one most widely publicised and, accordingly, is the primary reference point for any\nassessment of the reliability of budgeting, identification of major variances and assessment of the quality of\nstewardship in relation to the period. Therefore, this Standard mandates inclusion of the first budget presented\nto parliament. This Standard also allows for revised budgeted financial statements to be disclosed,\nacknowledging that revised budgets may occur late in the financial period and their disclosure can play a role\nin demonstrating an aspect of stewardship.  \nBC60 The Board concluded that the requirement for disclosure of explanations of major variances should be a key\nfeature within the Standard. It did so on the basis that the information is useful and relevant to users and that\nmerely recording the amount of the variance is not sufficient to meet accountability needs. An explanation\nof major variances is critical if users are to find comparisons between actual and budget valuable input to\ntheir analysis of the performance of government. A similar requirement exists within the New Zealand\nAccounting Standard NZ IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (paragraphs NZ41.1 and NZ41.2) \u2013 see\nalso paragraph 70 of NZ FRS-42 Prospective Financial Statements.  \nBC61 This is not an area in which the IASB has developed an IFRS. The Board considered IPSAS 24 Presentation\n_of Budget Information in Financial Statements and concluded that it does not provide an appropriate basis for_\nbudgetary reporting in the Australian environment, particularly because it gives primacy to the budget basis\nover the accounting basis and contemplates explanations of variances being disclosed outside the financial\nreport.  \nBC62 The Board also noted that, as part of the Uniform Presentation Framework, typically Australian jurisdictions\npublish GGS budget information together with budget information relating to the PNFC sector (and the NonFinancial Public Sector, comprising the GGS and PNFC sector) but not the PFC sector. The Board considered\nwhether sector-based budgetary information should be required to be disclosed in the whole of government\nfinancial report. The Board concluded that because the PNFC sector and PFC sector are not required by\nAustralian Accounting Standards to prepare separate financial reports, a requirement to disclose budget\ninformation for the PNFC sector and PFC sector in whole of government financial reports would be onerous\nand of limited use to users even if that budget information is presented to parliament. The Board also noted\nthat GGS budgetary information is required to be disclosed in GGS financial reports in accordance with this\nStandard. Accordingly, the Board concluded that sector-based budgetary information should not be required\nto be disclosed in whole of government financial reports.",

It required items of\nincome and expense not recognised in profit or loss to be presented in the statement of changes in equity,\npotentially together with owner changes in equity. Revised AASB 101 (issued September 2007) includes\nrequirements for income and expenses to be presented in one statement (a statement of comprehensive\nincome) or in two statements (a separate income statement and a statement of comprehensive income),\nseparately from owner changes in equity. As a result of these changes, revised AASB 101 more closely\naligned with the principles in AASB 1049 (issued October 2007), and it became possible for AASB 1049 to\nrely more heavily on the principles in AASB 101 by cross-reference rather than express requirements directly\nin AASB 1049. The changes help reinforce the approach taken in AASB 1049 of relying on other Standards\nrather than re-expressing the principles in those Standards directly in AASB 1049.  \nBC3 The Board noted that a consequence of relying on the revised AASB 101 is a requirement to present a\nstatement of changes in equity. Previously, AASB 1049 contemplated information pertinent to a statement\nof changes in equity being presented in a note or a separate statement to the extent the information is not\nincluded in the statement of comprehensive income. This is because of the way in which superseded\nAASB 101 treated such items. For example, superseded AASB 101 required changes in reserves to be\npresented in what was then a statement of changes in equity (which included components of comprehensive\nincome) or in the notes. It also contemplated transactions with owners in their capacity as owners being\npresented in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes. Revised AASB 101 requires changes in\nreserves and transactions with owners in their capacity as owners to be presented in the statement of changes\nin equity. Therefore, this Standard amends AASB 1049 to require the presentation of a statement of changes\nin equity.  \nBC4 With minor exceptions, the Board decided to align the terminology used in AASB 1049 with the terminology\nin revised AASB 101 to ensure greater consistency across the suite of Australian Accounting Standards. The\nreference to \u2018comprehensive result\u2019 and \u2018operating result\u2019 is retained, despite revised AASB 101\u2019s use of the\nterms \u2018total comprehensive income\u2019 and \u2018profit or loss\u2019. The Board concluded that, for the purpose of the\nStandard, the terms \u2018comprehensive result\u2019 and \u2018operating result\u2019 are more appropriate in a not-for-profit\npublic sector context.  \nBC5 Consistent with revised AASB 101, the financial statement titles \u2018balance sheet\u2019, \u2018operating statement\u2019 and\n\u2018cash flow statement\u2019 have been replaced by \u2018statement of financial position\u2019, \u2018statement of comprehensive\nincome\u2019 and \u2018statement of cash flows\u2019 respectively. However, the Board notes that, consistent with the\nflexibility on statement titles allowed for in revised AASB 101, whole of governments and GGSs would not\nbe restricted by AASB 1049 to using the titles used in AASB 1049.  \nBC6 The Board decided that the transitional requirements in the revised AASB 1049 should not be available to\ngovernments that have previously applied AASB 1049 as issued in October 2007. This is because the\ntransitional requirements should only be available once, on the initial transition to GAAP/GFS harmonisation.  \nBC7 Following feedback on AASB 1049 from constituents the Board decided to clarify that:  \n(a) the whole of government statement of comprehensive income disclosures referred to in paragraph\n41(b)(iii) of AASB 1049 relate to the sector statements of comprehensive income that are disclosed\nfor the whole of government; and  \n(b) the budget information disclosure requirements in paragraph 59 of AASB 1049 only relate to the\nbudgeted financial statement(s) that were initially presented to parliament.  \n-----  BC8 To assist in implementing the changes to AASB 1049 the Board decided to incorporate the changes into the\nIllustrative Examples in the Standard, including the addition of illustrations of the statement of changes in\nequity.  \nBC9 Following feedback from constituents on ED 163 the Board decided:  \n(a) to require that, where the revised AASB 1049 is applied to annual reporting periods beginning\nbefore 1 January 2009, there is early adoption for the same annual reporting period of AASB 101\n(September 2007). This will help to ensure consistency in application of the two Standards; and  \n(b) to illustrate the statement of changes in equity for the whole of government by sector in a downthe-page, rather than an across-the-page, format in an attempt to make it more understandable.  \n-----  ",

Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors\nthan to others.  \nBC1 Given the substantial change to financial reporting brought about by AASB 1049 Whole of Government and\n_General Government Sector Financial Reporting (October 2007), the Board decided to undertake a post-_\nimplementation review of that Standard. The objective was to identify any material issues at an operational\nlevel with a view to improving financial reporting. The post-implementation review included consideration\nof the consistency of application of AASB 1049 across jurisdictions.  \nBC2 Various methods were used to identify the AASB 1049 implementation issues, some of which are the subject\nof this Standard. These methods included consulting with personnel with AASB 1049 implementation\nexperience from each jurisdiction\u2019s Department of Treasury and Finance and Auditor-General\u2019s Office.  \nBC3 After reviewing the implementation issues identified, the Board proposed amendments to AASB 1049 in\nExposure Draft ED 211 Proposed Amendments to AASB 1049 (Issued in March 2011). The Exposure Draft\nwas structured to focus on two sets of proposals:  \n(a) Part 1, open for a 30-day comment period, relates to the definition of the ABS GFS Manual, relief\nfrom adopting the latest version of the ABS GFS Manual, and related disclosures; and  \n(b) Part 2, open for a 90-day comment period, relates to other proposals.  \nPart 1 had a 30-day comment period because of the Board\u2019s aim to provide relief as early as possible from\nthe requirement to adopt the latest version of the ABS GFS Manual, so that the relief would be available for\nthe reporting period ending on 30 June 2011. Therefore, this Standard arises from the Part 1 proposals in\nED 211. The second set of proposals will be considered in due course.",

        "page_content=": "## Issues giving rise to amendments to AASB 1049  \nOrderly adoption of changes to the ABS GFS Manual\n[paragraphs 13B, 39(a)(ii) & 39A]  \nBC4 The Board considered how best to draft requirements into AASB 1049 that would help facilitate the orderly\nadoption of future amendments to the ABS GFS Manual for the purposes of GAAP/GFS harmonised financial\nreporting. The Board noted that there are potentially two broad aspects to this issue:  \n(a) the manner in which a change to the ABS GFS Manual should be initially adopted in the\nGAAP/GFS harmonised financial statements for the purposes of determining GFS information\nincluded in those statements; and  \n(b) the time lag to allow between the change being issued and it becoming mandatory for the\nGAAP/GFS harmonised financial statements.  \nBC5 In relation to the manner in which a change in the ABS GFS Manual should be initially adopted, the Board\nnoted that if AASB 1049 were to override, or even merely clarify, GFS transitional arrangements, it would\narguably go beyond the Board\u2019s role, and potentially result in the Board interpreting or effectively modifying\nthe ABS GFS Manual. To avoid this, consistent with the approach in AASB 1049, the Board decided that\nAASB 1049 should adopt the ABS GFS Manual as it is. The Board noted that to do otherwise would create\nthe potential for there to be a permanent difference between the amounts presented as GFS in the financial\nstatements and amounts published by the ABS. However, the Board noted this decision only pertains to GFS\ninformation, and therefore GAAP requirements (including those relating to retrospectivity in AASB 108\n_Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors)_ apply, unamended, to the manner in\nwhich a change in accounting policy is initially adopted.  \n-----  BC6 In relation to time lag, the Board noted that providing relief through a \u2018time lag\u2019 has the potential to give rise\nto temporary differences between the amounts presented as GFS in the financial statements and amounts\npublished by the ABS. After considering alternative approaches on how to give an effective time lag between\nthe issue of an amendment to the ABS GFS Manual and when it becomes mandatory for GAAP/GFS\nharmonised financial reporting purposes, the Board decided AASB 1049 should specify that references to the\nABS GFS Manual are to the version of the Manual effective at the beginning of the previous annual reporting\nperiod or any version effective at a later date. The Board decided to allow jurisdictions to adopt a version of\nthe ABS GFS Manual for AASB 1049 financial reporting purposes, even if that version was not effective\nuntil after the beginning of the reporting period, consistent with the Board\u2019s usual policy of allowing early\nadoption of Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC7 The Board noted that this approach is broadly aligned with the Board\u2019s normal approach to specifying\ntransitional requirements for changes to GAAP because it:  \n(a) specifies, albeit in an ambulatory two year lagged way, a mandatory operative date for changes to\nthe ABS GFS Manual;  \n(b) provides a reasonable time for entities to implement changes to the ABS GFS Manual that could\naffect comparative information; and  \n(c) allows, but does not require, entities to adopt changes to the ABS GFS Manual prior to mandatory\noperative dates.  \nBC8 The Board also noted that this approach would warrant an amendment to paragraph 39 of AASB 1049, to\nhelp ensure users are informed about the version of the ABS GFS Manual adopted as the basis for GFS\ninformation included in financial statements. Consequently, amendments are made to Illustrative Example C\n\u2018Extract from the Note Containing the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of a General Government\nSector\u2019, which provides an illustration of disclosures required by paragraph 39. Also, consistent with\nparagraph 30 of AASB 108 relating to new but not yet effective Standards, the Board decided that AASB\n1049 should require the disclosure of information about the latest version of the ABS GFS Manual that has\nnot yet had an impact on the financial statements.  \nBC9 To address concerns about uncertainties that arise from the ABS potentially not specifying effective dates for\namendments to the ABS GFS Manual, the Board decided to clarify that the date on which amendments to the\nABS GFS Manual become effective is, for the purpose of AASB 1049, the publication date if no effective\ndate is specified by the ABS.",

Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.  \nBC2 On 5 April 2011, the ABS published on its website, Chapter 2 Amendments to Defence Weapons Platforms\nof the ABS publication Amendments to Australian Government Finance Statistics, 2005 (ABS Catalogue No.\n5514.0). Due to the interrelationship between the ABS GFS Manual and AASB 1049 Whole of Government\n_and General Government Sector Financial Reporting, the effect of the ABS Chapter 2 Amendments would_\nbe to require assets that are the subject of Chapter 2 to be measured at fair value, where reliably measurable,\nin the financial statements prepared in accordance with AASB 1049 for reporting periods beginning on or\nafter 1 July 2012.",

        "page_content=": "## Considerations in extending the transitional relief  \nBC3 Prior to issuing ED 227, the Board considered a submission arguing that more time was needed to measure\nassets classified as defence weapons platforms at fair value, for the purposes of financial reporting under\nAASB 1049, due to the magnitude and complexity of the valuation exercise for such assets. Constituents\nfamiliar with the nature and quantity of the assets involved advised the Board that an extension of transitional\nrelief for two years would be required to comply. The Board agreed that the extension is warranted, and\nconsidered that such an extension should be sufficient and therefore would not expect to provide further relief\nfor such assets in the future.  \nBC4 The Board also considered the existing disclosure requirements in paragraphs 39(a)(ii) and 39A of\nAASB 1049 and decided that, in principle, they would be adequate during the extended period in which the\nABS Chapter 2 Amendments are not applied in financial statements prepared in accordance with AASB 1049.\nHowever, to address concern that there might be potential confusion as to whether the disclosure requirements\nof paragraphs 39(a)(ii) and 39A would apply to an entity that elects to adopt the extended transitional relief,\nthe Board decided to clarify in paragraph 39(a)(ii) that such an entity is regarded as not having applied the\nlatest version of the ABS GFS Manual.  \nBC5 One Board member, Ian McPhee, abstained from voting on the issue of this Standard, which has the potential\nto significantly affect only the Australian Government, due to his role as the Auditor-General of that\nGovernment.  \n-----  ",
