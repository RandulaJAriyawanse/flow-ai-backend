An entity assesses whether\ninformation, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its\nfinancial statements taken as a whole.  \nInformation is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users of\nfinancial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The following are examples of\ncircumstances that may result in material information being obscured:  \n(a) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the financial\nstatements but the language used is vague or unclear;  \n(b) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is scattered throughout the\nfinancial statements;  \n(c) dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated;  \n(d) similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and  \n(e) the understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a result of material information\nbeing hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine\nwhat information is material.  \nAssessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary\nusers of a specific reporting entity\u2019s general purpose financial statements requires an entity to consider the\ncharacteristics of those users while also considering the entity\u2019s own circumstances.  \nMany existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to\nprovide information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the\nfinancial information they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose\nfinancial statements are directed. Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable\nknowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At\ntimes, even well-informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand\ninformation about complex economic phenomena.  \n**_Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the statement of financial position,_**\n**statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and**\n**statement of cash flows.

For example, when an entity presents the financial statements electronically, separate pages are\nnot always used; an entity then presents the above items to ensure that the information included in the\nfinancial statements can be understood.  \n53 An entity often makes financial statements more understandable by presenting information in thousands or\nmillions of units of the presentation currency. This is acceptable as long as the entity discloses the level of\nrounding and does not omit material information.",

Paragraph 54 simply\nlists items that are sufficiently different in nature or function to warrant separate presentation in the\nstatement of financial position. In addition:  \n(a) line items are included when the size, nature or function of an item or aggregation of similar\nitems is such that separate presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity\u2019s financial\nposition; and  \n(b) the descriptions used and the ordering of items or aggregation of similar items may be amended\naccording to the nature of the entity and its transactions, to provide information that is relevant to\nan understanding of the entity\u2019s financial position. For example, a financial institution may\namend the above descriptions to provide information that is relevant to the operations of a\nfinancial institution.  \n58 An entity makes the judgement about whether to present additional items separately on the basis of an\nassessment of:  \n(a) the nature and liquidity of assets;  \n(b) the function of assets within the entity; and  \n(c) the amounts, nature and timing of liabilities.  \n-----  59 The use of different measurement bases for different classes of assets suggests that their nature or function\ndiffers and, therefore, that an entity presents them as separate line items. For example, different classes of\nproperty, plant and equipment can be carried at cost or at revalued amounts in accordance with AASB 116.",

It also highlights assets that are expected to be realised\nwithin the current operating cycle, and liabilities that are due for settlement within the same period.  \n63 For some entities, such as financial institutions, a presentation of assets and liabilities in increasing or\ndecreasing order of liquidity provides information that is reliable and more relevant than a current/noncurrent presentation because the entity does not supply goods or services within a clearly identifiable\noperating cycle.  \n64 In applying paragraph 60, an entity is permitted to present some of its assets and liabilities using a\ncurrent/non-current classification and others in order of liquidity when this provides information that is\nreliable and more relevant. The need for a mixed basis of presentation might arise when an entity has\ndiverse operations.  \n65 Information about expected dates of realisation of assets and liabilities is useful in assessing the liquidity\nand solvency of an entity. AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires disclosure of the maturity\ndates of financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial assets include trade and other receivables, and\nfinancial liabilities include trade and other payables. Information on the expected date of recovery of nonmonetary assets such as inventories and expected date of settlement for liabilities such as provisions is also\nuseful, whether assets and liabilities are classified as current or as non-current. For example, an entity\ndiscloses the amount of inventories that are expected to be recovered more than twelve months after the\nreporting period.",

An entity classifies such\noperating items as current liabilities even if they are due to be settled more than twelve months after the\nreporting period. The same normal operating cycle applies to the classification of an entity\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. When the entity\u2019s normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve\nmonths.  \n_Held primarily for the purpose of trading (paragraph 69(b)) or due to be settled within_\n_twelve months (paragraph 69(c))_  \n71 Other current liabilities are not settled as part of the normal operating cycle, but are due for settlement\nwithin twelve months after the reporting period or held primarily for the purpose of trading. Examples are\nsome financial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading in AASB 9, bank overdrafts, and the\ncurrent portion of non-current financial liabilities, dividends payable, income taxes and other non-trade\npayables. Financial liabilities that provide financing on a long-term basis (ie are not part of the working\ncapital used in the entity\u2019s normal operating cycle) and are not due for settlement within twelve months\nafter the reporting period are non-current liabilities, subject to paragraphs 72A\u201375.  \n72 An entity classifies its financial liabilities as current when they are due to be settled within twelve months\nafter the reporting period, even if:  \n(a) the original term was for a period longer than twelve months, and  \n(b) an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the\nreporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue.  \n_Right to defer settlement for at least twelve months (paragraph 69(d))_  \n72A An entity\u2019s right to defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period must\nhave substance and, as illustrated in paragraphs 72B\u201375, must exist at the end of the reporting period.  \n72B An entity\u2019s right to defer settlement of a liability arising from a loan arrangement for at least twelve months\nafter the reporting period may be subject to the entity complying with conditions specified in that loan\narrangement (hereafter referred to as \u2018covenants\u2019). For the purposes of applying paragraph 69(d), such\ncovenants:  \n(a) affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period \u2013 as illustrated in paragraphs 74\n\u2013 75 \u2013 if an entity is required to comply with the covenant on or before the end of the reporting \nperiod. Such a covenant affects whether the right exists at the end of the reporting period even if\ncompliance with the covenant is assessed only after the reporting period (for example, a covenant\nbased on the entity\u2019s financial position at the end of the reporting period but assessed for\ncompliance only after the reporting period).  \n(b) do not affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period if an entity is required to\ncomply with the covenant only after the reporting period (for example, a covenant based on the\nentity\u2019s financial position six months after the end of the reporting period).  \n73 If an entity has the right, at the end of the reporting period, to roll over an obligation for at least twelve\nmonths after the reporting period under an existing loan facility, it classifies the obligation as non\u2011 current,\neven if it would otherwise be due within a shorter period. If the entity has no such right, the entity does not\nconsider the potential to refinance the obligation and classifies the obligation as current.  \n-----  74 When an entity breaches a covenant of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end of the reporting\nperiod with the effect that the liability becomes payable on demand, it classifies the liability as current, even\nif the lender agreed, after the reporting period and before the authorisation of the financial statements for\nissue, not to demand payment as a consequence of the breach. An entity classifies the liability as current\nbecause, at the end of the reporting period, it does not have the right to defer its settlement for at least\ntwelve months after that date.  \n75 However, an entity classifies the liability as non-current if the lender agreed by the end of the reporting\nperiod to provide a period of grace ending at least twelve months after the reporting period, within which\nthe entity can rectify the breach and during which the lender cannot demand immediate repayment.  \n75A Classification of a liability is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. If a liability meets the criteria\nin paragraph 69 for classification as non-current, it is classified as non-current even if management intends\nor expects the entity to settle the liability within twelve months after the reporting period, or even if the\nentity settles the liability between the end of the reporting period and the date the financial statements are\nauthorised for issue. However, in either of those circumstances, the entity may need to disclose information\nabout the timing of settlement to enable users of its financial statements to understand the impact of the\nliability on the entity\u2019s financial position (see paragraphs 17(c) and 76(d)).  \n76 If the following events occur between the end of the reporting period and the date the financial statements\nare authorised for issue, those events are disclosed as non-adjusting events in accordance with AASB 110\n_Events after the Reporting Period:_  \n(a) refinancing on a long\u2011 term basis of a liability classified as current (see paragraph 72);  \n(b) rectification of a breach of a long\u2011 term loan arrangement classified as current (see paragraph\n74);  \n(c) the granting by the lender of a period of grace to rectify a breach of a long\u2011 term loan\narrangement classified as current (see paragraph 75); and  \n(d) settlement of a liability classified as non-current (see paragraph 75A).  \n**76ZA** **In applying paragraphs 69\u201375, an entity might classify liabilities arising from loan arrangements as**\n**non-current when the entity\u2019s right to defer settlement of those liabilities is subject to the entity**\n**complying with covenants within twelve months after the reporting period (see paragraph 72B(b)). In**\n**such situations, the entity shall disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial**\n**statements to understand the risk that the liabilities could become repayable within twelve months**\n**after the reporting period, including:**  \n**(a)** **information about the covenants (including the nature of the covenants and when the entity**\n**is required to comply with them) and the carrying amount of related liabilities.**  \n**(b)** **facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have difficulty complying with**\n**the covenants \u2013 for example, the entity having acted during or after the reporting period to**\n**avoid or mitigate a potential breach. Such facts and circumstances could also include the**\n**fact that the entity would not have complied with the covenants if they were to be assessed**\n**for compliance based on the entity\u2019s circumstances at the end of the reporting period.**  \n_Settlement (paragraphs 69(a), 69(c) and 69(d))_  \n**76A** **For the purpose of classifying a liability as current or non-current, settlement refers to a transfer to**\n**the counterparty that results in the extinguishment of the liability. The transfer could be of:**  \n**(a)** **cash or other economic resources\u2014for example, goods or services; or**  \n**(b)** **the entity\u2019s own equity instruments, unless paragraph 76B applies.**  \n**76B** **Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the**\n**transfer of the entity\u2019s own equity instruments do not affect its classification as current or non-**\n**current if, applying AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the entity classifies the option as**\n**an equity instrument, recognising it separately from the liability as an equity component of a**\n**compound financial instrument.**  \n-----  **Information to be presented either in the statement of financial position or in**\n**the notes**  \n**77** **An entity shall disclose, either in the statement of financial position or in the notes, further**\n**subclassifications of the line items presented, classified in a manner appropriate to the entity\u2019s**\n**operations.**  \n78 The detail provided in subclassifications depends on the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards\nand on the size, nature and function of the amounts involved. An entity also uses the factors set out in\nparagraph 58 to decide the basis of subclassification. The disclosures vary for each item, for example:  \n(a) items of property, plant and equipment are disaggregated into classes in accordance with\nAASB 116;  \n(b) receivables are disaggregated into amounts receivable from trade customers, receivables from\nrelated parties, prepayments and other amounts;  \n(c) inventories are disaggregated, in accordance with AASB 102 Inventories, into classifications such\nas merchandise, production supplies, materials, work in progress and finished goods;  \n(d) provisions are disaggregated into provisions for employee benefits and other items; and  \n(e) equity capital and reserves are disaggregated into various classes, such as paid-in capital, share\npremium and reserves.  \n**79** **An entity shall disclose the following, either in the statement of financial position or the statement of**\n**changes in equity, or in the notes:**  \n**(a)** **for each class of share capital:**  \n**(i)** **the number of shares authorised;**  \n**(ii)** **the number of shares issued and fully paid, and issued but not fully paid;**  \n**(iii)** **par value per share, or that the shares have no par value;**  \n**(iv)** **a reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding at the beginning and at the**\n**end of the period;**  \n**(v)** **the rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to that class including**\n**restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital;**  \n**(vi)** **shares in the entity held by the entity or by its subsidiaries or associates; and**  \n**(vii)** **shares reserved for issue under options and contracts for the sale of shares,**\n**including terms and amounts; and**  \n**(b)** **a description of the nature and purpose of each reserve within equity.**  \n**80** **An entity without share capital, such as a partnership or trust, shall disclose information equivalent**\n**to that required by paragraph 79(a), showing changes during the period in each category of equity**\n**interest, and the rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to each category of equity interest.**  \n**80A** **If an entity has reclassified**  \n**(a)** **a puttable financial instrument classified as an equity instrument, or**  \n**(b)** **an instrument that imposes on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata**\n**share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation and is classified as an equity**\n**instrument**  \n**between financial liabilities and equity, it shall disclose the amount reclassified into and out of each**\n**category (financial liabilities or equity), and the timing and reason for that reclassification.**",

Such reclassifications are referred to in this\nStandard as reclassification adjustments. A reclassification adjustment is included with the related\ncomponent of other comprehensive income in the period that the adjustment is reclassified to profit or loss.\nThese amounts may have been recognised in other comprehensive income as unrealised gains in the current\nor previous periods. Those unrealised gains must be deducted from other comprehensive income in the\nperiod in which the realised gains are reclassified to profit or loss to avoid including them in total\ncomprehensive income twice.  \n94 An entity may present reclassification adjustments in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income or in the notes. An entity presenting reclassification adjustments in the notes\npresents the items of other comprehensive income after any related reclassification adjustments.  \n95 Reclassification adjustments arise, for example, on disposal of a foreign operation (see AASB 121) and\nwhen some hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss (see paragraph 6.5.11(d) of AASB 9 in relation\nto cash flow hedges).  \n96 Reclassification adjustments do not arise on changes in revaluation surplus recognised in accordance with\nAASB 116 or AASB 138 or on remeasurements of defined benefit plans recognised in accordance with\nAASB 119. These components are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to\nprofit or loss in subsequent periods. Changes in revaluation surplus may be transferred to retained earnings\nin subsequent periods as the asset is used or when it is derecognised (see AASB 116 and AASB 138). In\naccordance with AASB 9, reclassification adjustments do not arise if a cash flow hedge or the accounting\nfor the time value of an option (or the forward element of a forward contract or the foreign currency basis\nspread of a financial instrument) result in amounts that are removed from the cash flow hedge reserve or a\nseparate component of equity, respectively, and included directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount\nof an asset or a liability. These amounts are directly transferred to assets or liabilities.  \n**Information to be presented in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other**\n**comprehensive income or in the notes**  \n**97** **When items of income or expense are material, an entity shall disclose their nature and amount**\n**separately.**  \n98 Circumstances that would give rise to the separate disclosure of items of income and expense include:  \n(a) write-downs of inventories to net realisable value or of property, plant and equipment to\nrecoverable amount, as well as reversals of such write-downs;  \n(b) restructurings of the activities of an entity and reversals of any provisions for the costs of\nrestructuring;  \n(c) disposals of items of property, plant and equipment;  \nAusCF4 The Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements was amended by the AASB in December 2013.  \n-----  (d) disposals of investments;  \n(e) discontinued operations;  \n(f) litigation settlements; and  \n(g) other reversals of provisions.  \n**99** **An entity shall present an analysis of expenses recognised in profit or loss using a classification based**\n**on either their nature or their function within the entity, whichever provides information that is**\n**reliable and more relevant.**  \n100 Entities are encouraged to present the analysis in paragraph 99 in the statement(s) presenting profit or loss\nand other comprehensive income.  \n101 Expenses are subclassified to highlight components of financial performance that may differ in terms of\nfrequency, potential for gain or loss and predictability. This analysis is provided in one of two forms.  \n102 The first form of analysis is the \u2018nature of expense\u2019 method. An entity aggregates expenses within profit or\nloss according to their nature (for example, depreciation, purchases of materials, transport costs, employee\nbenefits and advertising costs), and does not reallocate them among functions within the entity. This method\nmay be simple to apply because no allocations of expenses to functional classifications are necessary. An\nexample of a classification using the nature of expense method is as follows:  \nRevenue X  \nOther income X  \nChanges in inventories of finished goods and work in progress X  \nRaw materials and consumables used X  \nEmployee benefits expense X  \nDepreciation and amortisation expense X  \nOther expenses X  \nTotal expenses (X)  \nProfit before tax X  \n103 The second form of analysis is the \u2018function of expense\u2019 or \u2018cost of sales\u2019 method and classifies expenses\naccording to their function as part of cost of sales or, for example, the costs of distribution or administrative\nactivities. At a minimum, an entity discloses its cost of sales under this method separately from other\nexpenses. This method can provide more relevant information to users than the classification of expenses by\nnature, but allocating costs to functions may require arbitrary allocations and involve considerable\njudgement. An example of a classification using the function of expense method is as follows:  \nRevenue X  \nCost of sales (X)  \nGross profit X  \nOther income X  \nDistribution costs (X)  \nAdministrative expenses (X)  \nOther expenses (X)  \nProfit before tax X  \n**104** **An entity classifying expenses by function shall disclose additional information on the nature of**\n**expenses, including depreciation and amortisation expense and employee benefits expense.**  \n105 The choice between the function of expense method and the nature of expense method depends on historical\nand industry factors and the nature of the entity. Both methods provide an indication of those costs that\nmight vary, directly or indirectly, with the level of sales or production of the entity. Because each method of\npresentation has merit for different types of entities, this Standard requires management to select the  \n-----  presentation that is reliable and more relevant. However, because information on the nature of expenses is\nuseful in predicting future cash flows, additional disclosure is required when the function of expense\nclassification is used. In paragraph 104, \u2018employee benefits\u2019 has the same meaning as in AASB 119.",

For example, an entity is likely\nto consider accounting policy information material to its financial statements if that information relates to\nmaterial transactions, other events or conditions and:  \n-----  (a) the entity changed its accounting policy during the reporting period and this change resulted in a\nmaterial change to the information in the financial statements;  \n(b) the entity chose the accounting policy from one or more options permitted by Australian\nAccounting Standards\u2014such a situation could arise if the entity chose to measure investment\nproperty at historical cost rather than fair value;  \n(c) the accounting policy was developed in accordance with AASB 108 in the absence of an\nAustralian Accounting Standard that specifically applies;  \n(d) the accounting policy relates to an area for which an entity is required to make significant\njudgements or assumptions in applying an accounting policy, and the entity discloses those\njudgements or assumptions in accordance with paragraphs 122 and 125; or  \n(e) the accounting required for them is complex and users of the entity\u2019s financial statements would\notherwise not understand those material transactions, other events or conditions\u2014such a situation\ncould arise if an entity applies more than one Australian Accounting Standard to a class of\nmaterial transactions.  \n117C Accounting policy information that focuses on how an entity has applied the requirements of the Australian\nAccounting Standards to its own circumstances provides entity-specific information that is more useful to\nusers of financial statements than standardised information, or information that only duplicates or\nsummarises the requirements of the Standards.  \n117D If an entity discloses immaterial accounting policy information, such information shall not obscure material\naccounting policy information.  \n117E An entity\u2019s conclusion that accounting policy information is immaterial does not affect the related\ndisclosure requirements set out in other Australian Accounting Standards.  \n118\u2013\n121 [Deleted]  \n**122** **An entity shall disclose, along with material accounting policy information or other notes, the**\n**judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see paragraph 125), that management has made**\n**in the process of applying the entity\u2019s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on**\n**the amounts recognised in the financial statements.**  \n123 In the process of applying the entity\u2019s accounting policies, management makes various judgements, apart\nfrom those involving estimations, that can significantly affect the amounts it recognises in the financial\nstatements. For example, management makes judgements in determining:  \n(a) [deleted]  \n(b) when substantially all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of financial assets and, for\nlessors, assets subject to leases are transferred to other entities;  \n(c) whether, in substance, particular sales of goods are financing arrangements and therefore do not\ngive rise to revenue; and  \n(d) whether the contractual terms of a financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that\nare solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.  \n124 Some of the disclosures made in accordance with paragraph 122 are required by other Australian\nAccounting Standards. For example, AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities requires an entity to\ndisclose the judgements it has made in determining whether it controls another entity.

In respect of those assets and liabilities, the notes shall include details of:**  \n**(a)** **their nature, and**  \n**(b)** **their carrying amount as at the end of the reporting period.**  \n126 Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of\nuncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. For example, in the  \n-----  absence of recently observed market prices, future-oriented estimates are necessary to measure the\nrecoverable amount of classes of property, plant and equipment, the effect of technological obsolescence on\ninventories, provisions subject to the future outcome of litigation in progress, and long-term employee\nbenefit liabilities such as pension obligations. These estimates involve assumptions about such items as the\nrisk adjustment to cash flows or discount rates, future changes in salaries and future changes in prices\naffecting other costs.  \n127 The assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty disclosed in accordance with paragraph 125\nrelate to the estimates that require management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the\nnumber of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increases,\nthose judgements become more subjective and complex, and the potential for a consequential material\nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities normally increases accordingly.  \n128 The disclosures in paragraph 125 are not required for assets and liabilities with a significant risk that their\ncarrying amounts might change materially within the next financial year if, at the end of the reporting\nperiod, they are measured at fair value based on a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or\nliability. Such fair values might change materially within the next financial year but these changes would\nnot arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period.  \n129 An entity presents the disclosures in paragraph 125 in a manner that helps users of financial statements to\nunderstand the judgements that management makes about the future and about other sources of estimation\nuncertainty. The nature and extent of the information provided vary according to the nature of the\nassumption and other circumstances. Examples of the types of disclosures an entity makes are:  \n(a) the nature of the assumption or other estimation uncertainty;  \n(b) the sensitivity of carrying amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying their\ncalculation, including the reasons for the sensitivity;  \n(c) the expected resolution of an uncertainty and the range of reasonably possible outcomes within\nthe next financial year in respect of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities affected; and  \n(d) an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning those assets and liabilities, if the\nuncertainty remains unresolved.  \n130 This Standard does not require an entity to disclose budget information or forecasts in making the\ndisclosures in paragraph 125.  \n131 Sometimes it is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of an assumption or another\nsource of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period. In such cases, the entity discloses that it\nis reasonably possible, on the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that\nare different from the assumption could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or\nliability affected. In all cases, the entity discloses the nature and carrying amount of the specific asset or\nliability (or class of assets or liabilities) affected by the assumption.  \n132 The disclosures in paragraph 122 of particular judgements that management made in the process of\napplying the entity\u2019s accounting policies do not relate to the disclosures of sources of estimation uncertainty\nin paragraph 125.  \n133 Other Australian Accounting Standards require the disclosure of some of the assumptions that would\notherwise be required in accordance with paragraph 125. For example, AASB 137 requires disclosure, in\nspecified circumstances, of major assumptions concerning future events affecting classes of provisions.\nAASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of significant assumptions (including the valuation\ntechnique(s) and inputs) the entity uses when measuring the fair values of assets and liabilities that are\ncarried at fair value.",
