Accordingly, if a GGS or whole of government budget\npresented to parliament is in the format described in (b), in accordance with paragraph 6(e) of this Standard,\nthat budgeted information would need to be restated for disclosure purposes to align with the format described\nin (a).  \n11 Any revised budget that is presented to parliament during the reporting period may be disclosed in the\nfinancial statements in addition to the original budget and might need to be referred to in explanations of\nmajor variances as noted in paragraph 15.  \n12 Information provided in accordance with paragraph 6 or 7 facilitates users of financial statements (including\ntaxpayers) making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of scarce resources and for assessing the\ndischarge of an entity\u2019s accountability. The budget information is disclosed on the same presentation and\nclassification bases adopted for the corresponding actual information in the financial statements, to facilitate\na comparison of actual outcomes against the budget. Accordingly:  \n(a) in relation to controlled items, to the extent the presentation and classification bases adopted in the\nbudget presented to parliament are not consistent with the corresponding financial statements, the\nbudget presented to parliament is restated for disclosure purposes to align with the presentation and\nclassification bases adopted in the corresponding financial statements. As such, the budget\ninformation may be presented in the corresponding financial statements; and  \n(b) in relation to administered items of entities within the GGS, to the extent the presentation and\nclassification bases adopted in the budget presented to parliament are not consistent with the\ncorresponding information about administered items disclosed in accordance with AASB 1050, the\nbudget presented to parliament is restated for disclosure purposes to align with the presentation and\nclassification bases adopted for the corresponding information about administered items disclosed\nin accordance with AASB 1050. As such, the budget information may be disclosed with the\ncorresponding information about administered items, including where the corresponding\ninformation about administered items is disclosed with the financial statements.  \n13 Budgeted financial information reflecting administered income and expenses, or assets and liabilities,\npresented to parliament that is subject to the requirements of paragraph 7 would, consistent with AASB 1050,\nat a minimum, contain information about major classes of administered income and expenses, or major classes\nof administered assets and liabilities. Accordingly, if the budgeted information of an entity within a GGS is\npresented to parliament only at a more highly summarised level, for example, budgeted aggregate of\nadministered income and expenses, that entity would not be required to report the budgetary information\nspecified in paragraph 7. Similarly, the requirements in paragraph 6 do not apply where parliament only\nreceives information about an entity\u2019s budgeted controlled items at a more highly summarised level than the\nlevel of information required by Australian Accounting Standards to be presented in the financial statements.  \n14 The budgetary reporting requirements in this Standard only apply to an entity within the GGS where budgeted  \ninformation about controlled or administered items is separately identified as relating to that entity within the\nbudgetary information presented to parliament. Accordingly, for example, where:  \n(a) a consolidated GGS budget presented to parliament incorporates a budget of an entity within the\nGGS in a way that the individual entity\u2019s budget is not separately identified as relating to that entity;\nand  \n(b) a separate individual budget is not presented to parliament for that entity;  \n-----  that entity\u2019s budget is not regarded as having been presented to parliament and therefore the entity is not\nrequired to report the budgetary information specified in this Standard.  \n15 The explanations of major variances required to be disclosed by paragraph 6(f) or 7(b) are those relevant to\nan assessment of the discharge of accountability and to an analysis of performance of an entity, not merely\nfocusing on the numerical differences between original budget and actual amounts. They include high-level\nexplanations of the causes of major variances rather than merely the nature of the variances. Furthermore, if\nrevised budgets are presented to parliament, even when there are no major numerical differences between the\noriginal budget and actual amounts, an entity might need to have regard to those revised budgets and include\nexplanations for major numerical differences between them and actual amounts. Such explanations are made\nwhen they are relevant for the assessment of the discharge of accountability and to an analysis of the\nperformance of an entity.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC1 AASB 1055 Budgetary Reporting arises from the Australian Accounting Standards Board\u2019s deliberations of\nthe proposals in Exposure Draft ED 212 Not-for-Profit Entities within the General Government Sector (issued\nin June 2011) relating to budgetary reporting.  \nBC2 This is not an area in which the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has developed an\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS). The Board considered the International Public Sector\nAccounting Standards Board\u2019s IPSAS 24 Presentation of Budget Information in Financial Statements and\nconcluded that it does not provide an appropriate basis for budgetary reporting in the Australian environment,\nparticularly because it gives primacy to the budget basis of presentation and classification over the accounting\nbasis of presentation and classification and contemplates explanations of variances being disclosed outside\nthe financial report.  \nBC3 Consistent with its general approach of issuing topic-based rather than industry-based standards, the Board\ndecided to locate budgetary reporting requirements for not-for-profit entities within the GGS in a separate\ntopic-based Standard. Accordingly, the Board also decided to relocate the budgetary reporting requirements\nfrom paragraphs 59-65 of AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial_\n_Reporting[1]_ (without substantive amendment) into AASB 1055. Hence, the Board issued, at the same time as\nAASB 1055, AASB 2013-1 Amendments to AASB 1049 \u2013 Relocation of Budgetary Reporting Requirements\nto remove the budgetary reporting requirements for each government\u2019s whole of government and GGS from\nAASB 1049.  \nBC4 As explained in paragraphs BC7 and BC12 below, the Board decided that the principles underpinning the\nbudgetary reporting requirements in AASB 1049 should apply to not-for-profit entities within the GGS.\nAccordingly, in AASB 1055, the budgetary reporting requirements that were in AASB 1049 are integrated\nwith the budgetary reporting requirements for not-for-profit entities within the GGS.  \nBC5 In relation to not-for-profit entities within the GGS, AASB 1055 provides guidance on how the budgetary\nreporting principles previously in AASB 1049 apply in the context of an entity within the GGS, including\nguidance relating to administered items, for circumstances where:  \n(a) an entity\u2019s budgetary information is incorporated into a consolidated budget of its parent; or  \n(b) only summarised budgetary information is presented to parliament.  \nBC6 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Board\u2019s main considerations in reaching the conclusions in\ndeveloping AASB 1055. It comprises the Board\u2019s main considerations relating to budgetary reporting\nrequirements previously included in the Basis for Conclusions of AASB 1049 and AASB 2011-13\n_Amendments to Australian Accounting Standard \u2013 Improvements to AASB 1049, as well as the Board\u2019s_\nsubsequent deliberations relating to the relevant proposals in ED 212.

        "page_content=": "## Entities Subject to the Requirements  \nBC7 The Board decided to extend the application of the principles underpinning the budgetary reporting\nrequirements in AASB 1049 to not-for-profit entities within the GGS, which include government departments\nand statutory authorities. This was on the basis that adoption of those principles has the potential to improve\nthe financial reporting by those entities in the relatively short term. Furthermore, such entities are a significant\ngroup for which there is a convention or formal requirement that budgets are published. Accordingly, the\ncurrent conventions or requirements for governments to present budgets to parliament provide a context for\nspecifying the budgetary reporting requirements for not-for-profit entities within the GGS.  \n1 As noted in the Basis for Conclusions accompanying AASB 1049, AASB 1049 was issued in response to the Financial Reporting  \nCouncil\u2019s direction. The direction was, among other things, to achieve an Australian Accounting Standard \u201c\u2026 in which the outcome\nstatements are directly comparable with the relevant budget statements\u201d. The budgetary reporting requirements previously included in\nAASB 1049 were consistent with this aspect of the FRC\u2019s direction.  \n-----  BC8 In limiting the types of entities that are included within the scope of AASB 1055, the Board noted that\ngovernments typically budget on a GGS basis rather than on a whole of government basis, and might present\nbudgets for individual not-for-profit entities within the GGS to parliament.",

        "page_content=": "## Entities Not Subject to the Requirements  \nBC9 The Board considered expanding the scope of the budgetary reporting requirements to a broader range of\npublic sector entities, for example, local governments or not-for-profit entities controlled by government\noutside the GGS. However, for the reasons given in paragraph BC7, the Board decided to limit the scope of\nAASB 1055 to each government\u2019s whole of government and GGS and not-for-profit entities within the GGS.\nThe Board noted it could in the future, as a separate project, address budgetary reporting requirements of a\nbroader range of public sector entities.  \nBC10 The Board decided not to consider budgetary reporting requirements for private sector entities (whether forprofit or not-for-profit) on the basis that, in contrast to the public sector, it is not typical for there to be a\nconvention or formal requirement to make a private sector entity\u2019s budgets public.  \nBC11 In developing the budgetary reporting requirements that were previously in AASB 1049, the Board noted\nthat, as part of the Uniform Presentation Framework, typically Australian jurisdictions publish GGS budget\ninformation together with budget information relating to the Public Non-Financial Corporation (PNFC) sector\n(and the Non-Financial Public Sector, comprising the GGS and PNFC sector) but not the Public Financial\nCorporation (PFC) sector. The Board considered whether sector-based budgetary information should be\nrequired to be disclosed in the whole of government financial report. The Board concluded that because the\nPNFC sector and PFC sector are not required by Australian Accounting Standards to prepare separate\nfinancial reports, a requirement to disclose budget information for the PNFC sector and PFC sector in whole\nof government financial reports would be onerous and of limited use to users even if that budget information\nis presented to parliament. The Board also noted that GGS budgetary information is required to be disclosed\nin GGS financial statements in accordance with AASB 1055. Accordingly, the Board concluded that sectorbased budgetary information should not be required to be disclosed in whole of government financial\nstatements.",

        "page_content=": "## Budgetary Reporting Requirements  \nBC12 In issuing AASB 1055, the Board noted that Australian Accounting Standards, including AASB 1055, do not\nprescribe the preparation of a budget. Within that context, as noted in paragraph BC7, the Board decided that\nbudgetary reporting requirements for not-for-profit entities within the GGS should be consistent with the\nbudgetary reporting requirements previously included in AASB 1049. This was on the basis that the\nrequirements are working satisfactorily in practice, as evidenced by the post-implementation review of that\nStandard conducted in March 2010, and there is no conceptual reason to not subject such entities to similar\nbudgetary reporting requirements under similar circumstances.  \nBC13 The Board decided to extend the application of the budgetary reporting principles in AASB 1049 to not-forprofit entities within the GGS after considering the implications of that decision from the perspective of its\nrole as a standard setter, the scope of financial reporting and its transaction neutral policy. Overall, the Board\nwas persuaded by the importance of budgetary reporting for accountability purposes of those entities. The\nBoard particularly noted that, for those entities, comparisons of current period actuals to the previous period\nactuals would provide an incomplete picture without the comparisons from budgets to actuals. This was\nbecause, for example, in relation to not-for-profit entities within the GGS, machinery of government changes\nin one period can often cause period to period comparisons to be less informative without the budget against\nactual comparisons.  \nBC14 Accordingly, consistent with the principles underpinning the budgetary reporting requirements previously in\nAASB 1049, the Board concluded that AASB 1055 should require disclosure of certain budgetary information\nwhere budgetary information is presented to parliament, including the original budgeted financial statements,\nreflecting controlled items. Similarly, where an entity within the GGS\u2019s budgeted information reflecting\nadministered items is presented to parliament, the Board concluded that AASB 1055 should require disclosure\nof original budgeted information reflecting administered items. In addition, the Board concluded that\nAASB 1055 should require explanations of major variances between actual amounts and the corresponding\nbudget amounts to be disclosed. Specific aspects of these decisions are explained in paragraphs BC15-BC28\nbelow.  \nBC15 In relation to extending the budgetary reporting requirements to administered items of not-for-profit entities\nwithin the GGS (a government\u2019s whole of government and GGS do not have administered items), the Board\nnoted its decision not to proceed with the proposal in ED 212 to require disclosure of information for  \n-----  administered items \u2018coupled\u2019 with controlled items, on the basis that administered items would be the subject\nof a more fundamental review under the Board\u2019s Control in the Not-for-Profit Sector project. However, the\nBoard considered the proposal relating to budgetary information about administered items to be a separate\nissue. On that basis, consistent with the budgetary reporting requirements for controlled items, the Board\ndecided that if original budgeted information about administered items is presented to parliament it should be\nrequired to be disclosed in the financial report, restated if necessary to align with the presentation and\nclassification adopted in the financial report for the information about administered items disclosed in\naccordance with AASB 1050.  \nBC16 The Board noted that AASB 1055 cannot explicitly cover all of the circumstances in which reporting against\noriginal budgets will need to be considered under the Standard. Judgement will need to be exercised to meet\nthe objective of the Standard. Furthermore, there is a variety of circumstances that could occur that would\nmake difficult the application of the principle that budgeted and actual numbers should be reported and\nvariances explained. For example, after an original budget is presented to parliament, entities might be\ndivided or combined (i.e. restructured) in ways that mean actual numbers do not directly relate meaningfully\nto original budget numbers. However, the Board noted that the principles in AASB 1055 could still be\napplicable in such circumstances. For example, in some of these circumstances, the original budgets\npresented to parliament can sensibly be divided or combined in a way that aligns with a post-budget\nrestructure and thereby facilitate explanations of individual variances. However, the Board also noted that in\nother circumstances it might be necessary to explain a restructuring descriptively because any allocation of\nthe original budget presented to parliament would be quite arbitrary and may not have been replaced for the\nnew entities involved by other budgets presented to parliament in the period of the restructuring.",

This is because the presented budget is the one most widely publicised\nand, accordingly, is the primary reference point for any assessment of the reliability of budgeting,\nidentification of major variances and assessment of an entity\u2019s performance in relation to the period.  \nBC18 As noted in paragraph BC5, the Board identified the need to provide additional guidance to facilitate the\napplication of the principles previously in AASB 1049 to an individual entity within the GGS relating to\nbudgets incorporated into a parent\u2019s consolidated budget or where only summarised budget information is\npresented to parliament.

This is because a revised budget, possibly revised late in a period, would\nlimit the ability of users to assess how well an entity performed over the whole period against its objectives\nreflected in the original budget. Accordingly, the Board decided that the budgetary disclosures required by\nAASB 1055 should be based on the original budget, with a discretion to disclose any additional revised\nbudgets, acknowledging that disclosure of revised budgets may occur late in the financial period and their\ndisclosure can provide useful input to assessments of an entity\u2019s performance and inform users of budget\nupdates.",

The Board noted the practical difficulties of recasting\namounts for recognition and measurement differences \u2013 e.g. retrospectively determining \u2018budgeted\u2019 fair\nvalues when hindsight is likely to influence such a determination. Accordingly, the requirements in\nparagraphs 6(e), 7(a) and 12 of AASB 1055 are expressed in a way that the budget should be restated solely\nfor presentation and classification matters, not for recognition and measurement matters.  \nBC22 The Board noted that as a result of this conclusion variances might arise from recognition and measurement\nprinciples adopted in the budget being different from the recognition and measurement principles adopted in  \n-----  the financial statements.

        "page_content=": "## Explanation of Major Variances [paragraphs 6(f), 7(b) and 15]  \nBC23 The Board noted that the requirement to include explanations of major variances between budgeted and actual\nfinancial information is questioned by some practitioners for two primary reasons:  \n(a) in relation to whole of government and GGS financial statements, the requirement to explain\nvariances is unnecessary as the variance explanations are not relevant to users because variance\nexplanations are more relevant at entity level and the reasons for changes in budgetary assumptions\nare explained every time the budgets are updated; and  \n(b) the inclusion of unaudited budgetary information within the audited financial statements results in\nreferences in an audit report in relation to budget information within the statements.  \nBC24 However, the Board concluded that the requirement for disclosure of explanations of major variances should\nbe a key feature within the Standard. It did so on the basis that the information is relevant to users and that\nmerely recording the amount of the variance is not sufficient to meet accountability needs. An explanation\nof major variances is critical if users are to find comparisons between actual and budget valuable input to\ntheir analysis of the performance of an entity. A similar requirement exists within the New Zealand\nAccounting Standards.  \nBC25 Although the budgetary disclosures in AASB 1055 are to be based on the original budget, the Board noted\nthat the requirement to disclose explanations of major variances between an original budget and actual\namounts might need to include references to revisions during a period, particularly if an entity\u2019s structure or\nobjectives are changed during the period, or government policy changes during the period have affected the\noriginal budget. For example, where there are major numerical differences between the actual and revised\nbudget amounts, the explanations of major variances might need to include causes that led to such differences,\neven if there were no major numerical differences between original budget and actual amounts. This would\nbe particularly when omission of such explanations would result in misleading users\u2019 analysis of an entity\u2019s\nperformance for a period or assessment of accountability.  \nBC26 The Board also noted that some question the suitability of referring to \u2018major\u2019 variances, given the role\nmateriality plays in standards. The Board decided to retain the reference, given it was used in AASB 1049\nwithout insurmountable practice issues being identified. However, the Board decided that it would reconsider\nthe matter in due course as part of a broader consideration of terminology associated with \u2018materiality\u2019 used\nin a range of standards.",
