For-profit entities applying the_ _Conceptual Framework for_\n_Financial Reporting are set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework._  \n2 This Standard does not apply to financial instruments (including guarantees) that are within the scope of\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments.  \n3 Executory contracts are contracts under which neither party has performed any of its obligations or both\nparties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent. This Standard does not apply to\nexecutory contracts unless they are onerous.  \n4 [Deleted]  \n5 When another Standard deals with a specific type of provision, contingent liability or contingent asset, an\nentity applies that Standard instead of this Standard. For example, some types of provisions are addressed in\nStandards on:  \n(a) [deleted]  \n(b) income taxes (see AASB 112 Income Taxes);  \n(c) leases (see AASB 16 Leases). However, this Standard applies to any lease that becomes onerous\nbefore the commencement date of the lease as defined in AASB 16. This Standard also applies to\nshort-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value accounted for in\naccordance with paragraph 6 of AASB 16 and that have become onerous;  \n(d) employee benefits (see AASB 119 Employee Benefits);  \n(e) insurance contracts and other contracts within the scope of AASB 17 Insurance Contracts;  \n-----  (f) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination (see AASB 3 _Business_\n_Combinations); and_  \n(g) revenue from contracts with customers (see AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers).\nHowever, as AASB 15 contains no specific requirements to address contracts with customers that\nare, or have become, onerous, this Standard applies to such cases.  \nAus5.1 Further to paragraph 5, public sector entities shall apply this Standard to provisions, contingent\nliabilities and contingent assets of an insurer, other than those arising from its contractual\nobligations and rights under insurance contracts within the scope of AASB 4 _Insurance_\n_Contracts._  \n6 [Deleted]  \n7 This Standard defines provisions as liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. In some countries the term\n\u2018provision\u2019 is also used in the context of items such as depreciation, impairment of assets and doubtful\ndebts: these are adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and are not addressed in this Standard.  \n8 Other Standards specify whether expenditures are treated as assets or as expenses. These issues are not\naddressed in this Standard. Accordingly, this Standard neither prohibits nor requires capitalisation of the\ncosts recognised when a provision is made.  \n9 This Standard applies to provisions for restructurings (including discontinued operations). When a\nrestructuring meets the definition of a discontinued operation, additional disclosures may be required by\nAASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.",

For an event to be an obligating\nevent, it is necessary that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation created by the event.\nThis is the case only:  \n(a) where the settlement of the obligation can be enforced by law; or  \n(b) in the case of a constructive obligation, where the event (which may be an action of the entity)\ncreates valid expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation.  \n18 Financial statements deal with the financial position of an entity at the end of its reporting period and not its\npossible position in the future. Therefore, no provision is recognised for costs that need to be incurred to\noperate in the future. The only liabilities recognised in an entity\u2019s statement of financial position are those\nthat exist at the end of the reporting period.  \n19 It is only those obligations arising from past events existing independently of an entity\u2019s future actions (ie\nthe future conduct of its business) that are recognised as provisions. Examples of such obligations are\npenalties or clean-up costs for unlawful environmental damage, both of which would lead to an outflow of\nresources embodying economic benefits in settlement regardless of the future actions of the entity.\nSimilarly, an entity recognises a provision for the decommissioning costs of an oil installation or a nuclear\npower station to the extent that the entity is obliged to rectify damage already caused. In contrast, because\nof commercial pressures or legal requirements, an entity may intend or need to carry out expenditure to\noperate in a particular way in the future (for example, by fitting smoke filters in a certain type of factory).\nBecause the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for example by changing its\nmethod of operation, it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.  \n20 An obligation always involves another party to whom the obligation is owed. It is not necessary, however,\nto know the identity of the party to whom the obligation is owed\u2014indeed the obligation may be to the\npublic at large. Because an obligation always involves a commitment to another party, it follows that a\nmanagement or board decision does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting\nperiod unless the decision has been communicated before the end of the reporting period to those affected\nby it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will discharge its\nresponsibilities.  \n21 An event that does not give rise to an obligation immediately may do so at a later date, because of changes\nin the law or because an act (for example, a sufficiently specific public statement) by the entity gives rise to\na constructive obligation. For example, when environmental damage is caused there may be no obligation to\nremedy the consequences. However, the causing of the damage will become an obligating event when a\nnew law requires the existing damage to be rectified or when the entity publicly accepts responsibility for\nrectification in a way that creates a constructive obligation.  \n22 Where details of a proposed new law have yet to be finalised, an obligation arises only when the legislation\nis virtually certain to be enacted as drafted. For the purpose of this Standard, such an obligation is treated as\na legal obligation. Differences in circumstances surrounding enactment make it impossible to specify a\nsingle event that would make the enactment of a law virtually certain. In many cases it will be impossible to\nbe virtually certain of the enactment of a law until it is enacted.  \n-----  ",

This is especially true in the case of provisions, which by their nature are more uncertain\nthan most other items in the statement of financial position. Except in extremely rare cases, an entity will be\nable to determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an estimate of the obligation that is\nsufficiently reliable to use in recognising a provision.  \n26 In the extremely rare case where no reliable estimate can be made, a liability exists that cannot be\nrecognised. That liability is disclosed as a contingent liability (see paragraph 86).  \n**Recognition of liabilities arising from local government and government**\n**existing public policies, budget policies, election promises or statements of**\n**intent**  \nAus26.1 This paragraph and paragraph Aus26.2 relate to the recognition by a local government,\ngovernment department or government of a liability arising from a local government or\ngovernment existing public policy, budget policy, election promise or statement of intent. The\nintention to make payments to other parties, whether advised in the form of a local government or\ngovernment budget policy, election promise or statement of intent, does not of itself create a\npresent obligation which is binding. A liability would be recognised only when the entity is\ncommitted in the sense that it has little or no discretion to avoid the sacrifice of future economic\nbenefits. For example, a government does not have a present obligation to sacrifice future\neconomic benefits for social welfare payments that might arise in future reporting periods. A\npresent obligation for social welfare payments arises only when entitlement conditions are\nsatisfied for payment during a particular payment period. Similarly, a government does not have a\npresent obligation to sacrifice future economic benefits under multi-year public policy\nagreements until the grantee meets conditions such as grant eligibility criteria, or has provided the\nservices or facilities required under the grant agreement. In such cases, only amounts outstanding\nin relation to current or previous periods satisfy the definition of liabilities.  \nAus26.2 Some such transactions or events may give rise to legal, social, political or economic\nconsequences which leave little, if any, discretion to avoid a sacrifice of future economic benefits.\nIn such circumstances, the definition of a liability is satisfied. An example of such an event is the\noccurrence of a disaster, where a government has a clear and formal policy to provide financial\naid to victims of such disasters. In this circumstance, the government has little discretion to avoid\nthe sacrifice of future economic benefits. However, the liability is recognised only when the\namount of financial aid to be provided can be measured reliably.",

If it is expected that there will be a long delay before the\nrestructuring begins or that the restructuring will take an unreasonably long time, it is unlikely that the plan\nwill raise a valid expectation on the part of others that the entity is at present committed to restructuring,\nbecause the timeframe allows opportunities for the entity to change its plans.  \n75 A management or board decision to restructure taken before the end of the reporting period does not give\nrise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the entity has, before the end of the\nreporting period:  \n(a) started to implement the restructuring plan; or  \n(b) announced the main features of the restructuring plan to those affected by it in a sufficiently\nspecific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will carry out the restructuring.  \nIf an entity starts to implement a restructuring plan, or announces its main features to those affected, only\nafter the reporting period, disclosure is required under AASB 110 Events after the Reporting Period, if the\nrestructuring is material and non-disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the\nprimary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which\nprovide financial information about a specific reporting entity.  \n76 Although a constructive obligation is not created solely by a management decision, an obligation may result\nfrom other earlier events together with such a decision. For example, negotiations with employee\nrepresentatives for termination payments, or with purchasers for the sale of an operation, may have been\nconcluded subject only to board approval. Once that approval has been obtained and communicated to the\nother parties, the entity has a constructive obligation to restructure, if the conditions of paragraph 72 are\nmet.  \n77 In some countries, the ultimate authority is vested in a board whose membership includes representatives of\ninterests other than those of management (eg employees) or notification to such representatives may be\nnecessary before the board decision is taken. Because a decision by such a board involves communication\nto these representatives, it may result in a constructive obligation to restructure.  \n**78** **No obligation arises for the sale of an operation until the entity is committed to the sale, ie there is a**\n**binding sale agreement.**  \n79 Even when an entity has taken a decision to sell an operation and announced that decision publicly, it\ncannot be committed to the sale until a purchaser has been identified and there is a binding sale agreement.\nUntil there is a binding sale agreement, the entity will be able to change its mind and indeed will have to\ntake another course of action if a purchaser cannot be found on acceptable terms. When the sale of an\noperation is envisaged as part of a restructuring, the assets of the operation are reviewed for impairment,\nunder AASB 136. When a sale is only part of a restructuring, a constructive obligation can arise for the\nother parts of the restructuring before a binding sale agreement exists.  \n**80** **A restructuring provision shall include only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring,**\n**which are those that are both:**  \n**(a)** **necessarily entailed by the restructuring; and**  \n**(b)** **not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.**  \n81 A restructuring provision does not include such costs as:  \n(a) retraining or relocating continuing staff;  \n(b) marketing; or  \n(c) investment in new systems and distribution networks.  \nThese expenditures relate to the future conduct of the business and are not liabilities for restructuring at the\nend of the reporting period. Such expenditures are recognised on the same basis as if they arose\nindependently of a restructuring.  \n-----  82 Identifiable future operating losses up to the date of a restructuring are not included in a provision, unless\nthey relate to an onerous contract as defined in paragraph 10.  \n83 As required by paragraph 51, gains on the expected disposal of assets are not taken into account in\nmeasuring a restructuring provision, even if the sale of assets is envisaged as part of the restructuring.",
