Conversely, if the entity holds, directly or indirectly (eg through subsidiaries), less than\n20 per cent of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity does not have significant\ninfluence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. A substantial or majority ownership by another\ninvestor does not necessarily preclude an entity from having significant influence.  \n6 The existence of significant influence by an entity is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways:  \n(a) representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;  \n(b) participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or\nother distributions;  \n(c) material transactions between the entity and its investee;  \n(d) interchange of managerial personnel; or  \n(e) provision of essential technical information.  \n7 An entity may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity instruments that are convertible into\nordinary shares, or other similar instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to give the\nentity additional voting power or to reduce another party\u2019s voting power over the financial and operating\npolicies of another entity (ie potential voting rights). The existence and effect of potential voting rights that\nare currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights held by other entities, are considered\nwhen assessing whether an entity has significant influence. Potential voting rights are not currently\nexercisable or convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or\nuntil the occurrence of a future event.  \n8 In assessing whether potential voting rights contribute to significant influence, the entity examines all facts\nand circumstances (including the terms of exercise of the potential voting rights and any other contractual\narrangements whether considered individually or in combination) that affect potential rights, except the\nintentions of management and the financial ability to exercise or convert those potential rights.  \n9 An entity loses significant influence over an investee when it loses the power to participate in the financial\nand operating policy decisions of that investee. The loss of significant influence can occur with or without a\nchange in absolute or relative ownership levels. It could occur, for example, when an associate becomes\nsubject to the control of a government, court, administrator or regulator. It could also occur as a result of a\ncontractual arrangement.",

        "page_content=": "## Equity method  \n10 Under the equity method, on initial recognition the investment in an associate or a joint venture is recognised\nat cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor\u2019s share of the profit or\nloss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor\u2019s share of the investee\u2019s profit or loss is\nrecognised in the investor\u2019s profit or loss. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount\nof the investment. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary for changes in the investor\u2019s\nproportionate interest in the investee arising from changes in the investee\u2019s other comprehensive income.\nSuch changes include those arising from the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and from foreign\nexchange translation differences. The investor\u2019s share of those changes is recognised in the investor\u2019s other\ncomprehensive income (see AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements).  \n-----  Aus10.1 Notwithstanding paragraph 10, not-for-profit entities shall initially measure the cost of an\ninvestment in an associate or joint venture at fair value in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value\n_Measurement where the consideration for the investment is significantly less than fair value_\nprincipally to enable the entity to further its objectives. AASB 1058 _Income of Not-for-Profit_\n_Entities addresses the recognition of related amounts._  \n11 The recognition of income on the basis of distributions received may not be an adequate measure of the\nincome earned by an investor on an investment in an associate or a joint venture because the distributions\nreceived may bear little relation to the performance of the associate or joint venture. Because the investor has\njoint control of, or significant influence over, the investee, the investor has an interest in the associate\u2019s or\njoint venture\u2019s performance and, as a result, the return on its investment. The investor accounts for this interest\nby extending the scope of its financial statements to include its share of the profit or loss of such an investee.\nAs a result, application of the equity method provides more informative reporting of the investor\u2019s net assets\nand profit or loss.  \n12 When potential voting rights or other derivatives containing potential voting rights exist, an entity\u2019s interest\nin an associate or a joint venture is determined solely on the basis of existing ownership interests and does\nnot reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and other derivative instruments,\nunless paragraph 13 applies.  \n13 In some circumstances, an entity has, in substance, an existing ownership as a result of a transaction that\ncurrently gives it access to the returns associated with an ownership interest. In such circumstances, the\nproportion allocated to the entity is determined by taking into account the eventual exercise of those potential\nvoting rights and other derivative instruments that currently give the entity access to the returns.  \n14 AASB 9 Financial Instruments does not apply to interests in associates and joint ventures that are accounted\nfor using the equity method. When instruments containing potential voting rights in substance currently give\naccess to the returns associated with an ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture, the instruments\nare not subject to AASB 9. In all other cases, instruments containing potential voting rights in an associate or\na joint venture are accounted for in accordance with AASB 9.  \n14A An entity also applies AASB 9 to other financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the\nequity method is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity\u2019s\nnet investment in an associate or joint venture (see paragraph 38). An entity applies AASB 9 to such longterm interests before it applies paragraph 38 and paragraphs 40\u201343 of this Standard. In applying AASB 9, the\nentity does not take account of any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interests that arise from\napplying this Standard.  \n15 Unless an investment, or a portion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture is classified as held for\nsale in accordance with AASB 5 _Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the_\ninvestment, or any retained interest in the investment not classified as held for sale, shall be classified as a\nnon-current asset.",

        "page_content=": "## Equity method procedures  \n26 Many of the procedures that are appropriate for the application of the equity method are similar to the\nconsolidation procedures described in AASB 10. Furthermore, the concepts underlying the procedures used\nin accounting for the acquisition of a subsidiary are also adopted in accounting for the acquisition of an\ninvestment in an associate or a joint venture.  \n27 A group\u2019s share in an associate or a joint venture is the aggregate of the holdings in that associate or joint\nventure by the parent and its subsidiaries. The holdings of the group\u2019s other associates or joint ventures are\nignored for this purpose. When an associate or a joint venture has subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures,\nthe profit or loss, other comprehensive income and net assets taken into account in applying the equity method\nare those recognised in the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s financial statements (including the associate\u2019s or\njoint venture\u2019s share of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and net assets of its associates and\njoint ventures), after any adjustments necessary to give effect to uniform accounting policies (see paragraphs\n35\u201336A).  \n28 Gains and losses resulting from \u2018upstream\u2019 and \u2018downstream\u2019 transactions between an entity (including its\nconsolidated subsidiaries) and its associate or joint venture are recognised in the entity\u2019s financial statements\nonly to the extent of unrelated investors\u2019 interests in the associate or joint venture. \u2018Upstream\u2019 transactions\nare, for example, sales of assets from an associate or a joint venture to the investor. \u2018Downstream\u2019 transactions  \n-----  are, for example, sales or contributions of assets from the investor to its associate or its joint venture. The\ninvestor\u2019s share in the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s gains or losses resulting from these transactions is\neliminated.  \n29 When downstream transactions provide evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of the assets to be\nsold or contributed, or of an impairment loss of those assets, those losses shall be recognised in full by the\ninvestor. When upstream transactions provide evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of the assets\nto be purchased or of an impairment loss of those assets, the investor shall recognise its share in those losses.  \n30 The contribution of a non-monetary asset to an associate or a joint venture in exchange for an equity interest\nin the associate or joint venture shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph 28, except when the\ncontribution lacks commercial substance, as that term is described in AASB 116 _Property, Plant and_\n_Equipment. If such a contribution lacks commercial substance, the gain or loss is regarded as unrealised and_\nis not recognised unless paragraph 31 also applies. Such unrealised gains and losses shall be eliminated\nagainst the investment accounted for using the equity method and shall not be presented as deferred gains or\nlosses in the entity\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position or in the entity\u2019s statement of financial\nposition in which investments are accounted for using the equity method.  \n31 If, in addition to receiving an equity interest in an associate or a joint venture, an entity receives monetary or\nnon-monetary assets, the entity recognises in full in profit or loss the portion of the gain or loss on the nonmonetary contribution relating to the monetary or non-monetary assets received.  \n32 An investment is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which it becomes an associate or a\njoint venture. On acquisition of the investment, any difference between the cost of the investment and the\nentity\u2019s share of the net fair value of the investee\u2019s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as\nfollows:  \n(a) Goodwill relating to an associate or a joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the\ninvestment. Amortisation of that goodwill is not permitted.  \n(b) Any excess of the entity\u2019s share of the net fair value of the investee\u2019s identifiable assets and\nliabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity\u2019s\nshare of the associate or joint venture\u2019s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is\nacquired.  \nAppropriate adjustments to the entity\u2019s share of the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s profit or loss after acquisition\nare made in order to account, for example, for depreciation of the depreciable assets based on their fair values\nat the acquisition date. Similarly, appropriate adjustments to the entity\u2019s share of the associate\u2019s or joint\nventure\u2019s profit or loss after acquisition are made for impairment losses such as for goodwill or property,\nplant and equipment.  \n**33** **The most recent available financial statements of the associate or joint venture are used by the entity**\n**in applying the equity method. When the end of the reporting period of the entity is different from that**\n**of the associate or joint venture, the associate or joint venture prepares, for the use of the entity,**\n**financial statements as of the same date as the financial statements of the entity unless it is**\n**impracticable to do so.**  \n**34** **When, in accordance with paragraph 33, the financial statements of an associate or a joint venture used**\n**in applying the equity method are prepared as of a date different from that used by the entity,**\n**adjustments shall be made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between that**\n**date and the date of the entity\u2019s financial statements. In any case, the difference between the end of the**\n**reporting period of the associate or joint venture and that of the entity shall be no more than three**\n**months. The length of the reporting periods and any difference between the ends of the reporting**\n**periods shall be the same from period to period.**  \n**35** **The entity\u2019s financial statements shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like**\n**transactions and events in similar circumstances.**  \n36 Except as described in paragraph 36A, if an associate or a joint venture uses accounting policies other than\nthose of the entity for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, adjustments shall be made to\nmake the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s accounting policies conform to those of the entity when the associate\u2019s\nor joint venture\u2019s financial statements are used by the entity in applying the equity method.  \n36A Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph 36, if an entity that is not itself an investment entity has an\ninterest in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, the entity may, when applying the equity\nmethod, elect to retain the fair value measurement applied by that investment entity associate or joint venture\nto the investment entity associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s interests in subsidiaries. This election is made separately\nfor each investment entity associate or joint venture, at the later of the date on which (a) the investment entity\nassociate or joint venture is initially recognised; (b) the associate or joint venture becomes an investment\nentity; and (c) the investment entity associate or joint venture first becomes a parent.  \n-----  37 If an associate or a joint venture has outstanding cumulative preference shares that are held by parties other\nthan the entity and are classified as equity, the entity computes its share of profit or loss after adjusting for\nthe dividends on such shares, whether or not the dividends have been declared.  \n38 If an entity\u2019s share of losses of an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or\njoint venture, the entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. The interest in an associate or a\njoint venture is the carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture determined using the\nequity method together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity\u2019s net investment\nin the associate or joint venture. For example, an item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to\noccur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an extension of the entity\u2019s investment in that associate or\njoint venture. Such items may include preference shares and long-term receivables or loans, but do not include\ntrade receivables, trade payables or any long-term receivables for which adequate collateral exists, such as\nsecured loans. Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the entity\u2019s investment in ordinary\nshares are applied to the other components of the entity\u2019s interest in an associate or a joint venture in the\nreverse order of their seniority (ie priority in liquidation).  \n39 After the entity\u2019s interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised,\nonly to the extent that the entity has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of\nthe associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes\nrecognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.",

        "page_content=": "## Impairment losses  \n40 After application of the equity method, including recognising the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s losses in\naccordance with paragraph 38, the entity applies paragraphs 41A\u201341C to determine whether there is any\nobjective evidence that its net investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired.  \n41 [Deleted]  \n41A The net investment in an associate or joint venture is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only\nif, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial\nrecognition of the net investment (a \u2018loss event\u2019) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated\nfuture cash flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. It may not be possible to identify a\nsingle, discrete event that caused the impairment. Rather the combined effect of several events may have\ncaused the impairment. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.\nObjective evidence that the net investment is impaired includes observable data that comes to the attention of\nthe entity about the following loss events:  \n(a) significant financial difficulty of the associate or joint venture;  \n(b) a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in payments by the associate or joint venture;  \n(c) the entity, for economic or legal reasons relating to its associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s financial\ndifficulty, granting to the associate or joint venture a concession that the entity would not otherwise\nconsider;  \n(d) it becoming probable that the associate or joint venture will enter bankruptcy or other financial\nreorganisation; or  \n(e) the disappearance of an active market for the net investment because of financial difficulties of the\nassociate or joint venture.  \n41B The disappearance of an active market because the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s equity or financial\ninstruments are no longer publicly traded is not evidence of impairment. A downgrade of an associate\u2019s or\njoint venture\u2019s credit rating or a decline in the fair value of the associate or joint venture, is not of itself,\nevidence of impairment, although it may be evidence of impairment when considered with other available\ninformation.  \n41C In addition to the types of events in paragraph 41A, objective evidence of impairment for the net investment\nin the equity instruments of the associate or joint venture includes information about significant changes with\nan adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which\nthe associate or joint venture operates, and indicates that the cost of the investment in the equity instrument\nmay not be recovered. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity\ninstrument below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment.  \n42 Because goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of the net investment in an associate or a joint venture\nis not separately recognised, it is not tested for impairment separately by applying the requirements for\nimpairment testing goodwill in AASB 136 Impairment of Assets. Instead, the entire carrying amount of the\ninvestment is tested for impairment in accordance with AASB 136 as a single asset, by comparing its\nrecoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount  \n-----  whenever application of paragraphs 41A\u201341C indicates that the net investment may be impaired. An\nimpairment loss recognised in those circumstances is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms\npart of the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate or joint venture. Accordingly, any reversal\nof that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with AASB 136 to the extent that the recoverable amount\nof the net investment subsequently increases. In determining the value in use of the net investment, an entity\nestimates:  \n(a) its share of the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the\nassociate or joint venture, including the cash flows from the operations of the associate or joint\nventure and the proceeds from the ultimate disposal of the investment; or  \n(b) the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from dividends to be received\nfrom the investment and from its ultimate disposal.  \nUsing appropriate assumptions, both methods give the same result.  \n43 The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture shall be assessed for each associate\nor joint venture, unless the associate or joint venture does not generate cash inflows from continuing use that\nare largely independent of those from other assets of the entity.",

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC2 Paragraph 10 of AASB 127 _Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (in common with IAS 27_\n_Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements) provides relief from preparing consolidated financial_\nstatements for parents that meet four criteria, including having an ultimate parent or an intermediate parent\nthat prepares IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements (paragraph 10(d)).  \nBC3 Due to the addition of Aus paragraphs in IFRSs as adopted in Australia, the financial statements of some\nentities applying Australian Accounting Standards are not IFRS compliant. This means that a parent that has\nan ultimate parent or other intermediate parent that prepares non-IFRS-compliant consolidated financial\nstatements does not have access to the exemption from consolidation provided in paragraph 10 of AASB 127,\neven if the criteria in paragraphs 10(a) to 10(c) are met.  \nBC4 Similarly, investors need not apply the equity method when they meet the four criteria in paragraph 13(c) of\nAASB 128 Investments in Associates and venturers need not apply proportionate consolidation or the equity\nmethod when they meet the four criteria in paragraph 2(c) of AASB 131 _Interests in Joint Ventures. The_\ncriteria in paragraph 10 of AASB 127, paragraph 13(c) of AASB 128 and paragraph 2(c) of AASB 131 are\nsimilar.  \nBC5 Consequently, the exemptions from the equity method and proportionate consolidation are also not available\nunder those paragraphs to an investor or a venturer when its ultimate parent or intermediate parent prepares\nnon-IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements.  \nBC6 The AASB issued Exposure Draft ED 205 _Extending Relief from Consolidation, the Equity Method and_\n_Proportionate Consolidation in September 2010. The AASB considered the submissions received from_\nconstituents and confirmed the principal approach proposed in the Exposure Draft.",

        "page_content=": "## New Zealand approach  \nBC7 During its development of ED 205, the AASB noted that a related issue was considered by the Financial\nReporting Standards Board (FRSB) of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants in December\n2008. This concerned the requirement in paragraph 10(d) of NZ IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial\n_Statements that the parent\u2019s financial statements must be \u2018available for public use\u2019. Due to the reporting_\nrequirements in New Zealand, not all entities are required to file their financial statements with the Companies\nOffice. Hence, when a parent of a group is not required to submit its financial statements, any intermediate\nsubsidiaries were unable to use the paragraph 10 exemption. As a result, the FRSB inserted paragraph NZ\n3.1 into NZ IAS 27 so that entities that qualify for differential reporting concessions were not required to\ncomply with paragraph 10(d). In order to qualify for the exemption not to present consolidated financial\nstatements, qualifying entities were still required to comply with all the other conditions in paragraph 10.  \nBC8 In addition, the AASB noted that the FRSB had inserted a similar exemption into NZ IAS 28 Investments in\n_Associates (paragraph NZ 1.2) and NZ IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (paragraph NZ 1.1), extending the_\nrelief from application of the equity method by investors and proportionate consolidation or the equity method\nby venturers.  \nBC9 The AASB did not follow the FRSB\u2019s specific approach for qualifying entities, given the different issues\nfaced by the two Boards and the different financial reporting framework in New Zealand, including its  \n-----  differential reporting framework that involves modifications to the recognition and measurement\nrequirements of IFRSs.",

        "page_content=": "## Extending the exemptions  \nBC10 The AASB considered the limitations on the exemptions and developed a view that relief from consolidation,\nthe equity method and proportionate consolidation should be extended to a not-for-profit or Tier 2 parent,\ninvestor or venturer if it:  \n(a) has a parent higher up in the group that prepares consolidated financial statements (whether or not\nIFRS-compliant) that are available for public use and:  \n(i) those consolidated financial statements incorporate the information that would otherwise\nhave been presented in the parent\u2019s consolidated financial statements or the investor\u2019s or\nventurer\u2019s financial statements; or  \n(ii) the parent, investor or venturer is an entity complying with Australian Accounting\nStandards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (\u2018Tier 2\u2019); and  \n(b) meets the criteria in paragraphs 10(a) to 10(c) of AASB 127, paragraphs 13(c)(i) to 13(c)(iii) of\nAASB 128 or paragraphs 2(c)(i) to 2(c)(iii) of AASB 131, as relevant.  \nBC11 This view is based on the principle that financial statement users would be able to satisfy their information\nneeds through the consolidated financial statements prepared by the parent higher up in the group. However,\nthe AASB decided that such relief should not be available in relation to the General Government Sector (GGS)\nof each Federal, State and Territory Government due to the unique circumstances related to the GGS, its\nrelationship to the whole of government and its macro-economic significance. The AASB also decided that\nthe partial consolidation basis for GGS financial statements required by AASB 1049 Whole of Government\n_and General Government Sector Financial Reporting would not be amended._  \nBC12 Consistent with IAS 27, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, the AASB\ndecided that the existing relief provided under paragraph 10 of AASB 127, paragraph 13(c) of AASB 128\nand paragraph 2(c) of AASB 131 should be retained. The extension of relief on the basis set out in paragraph\nBC10 does not change the present requirements for relief when the ultimate or intermediate parent is a forprofit Tier 1 entity \u2013 that entity is still required to prepare IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements.",

Extending relief to\nthe for-profit Tier 1 parent, investor or venturer in this case would be beyond the scope of the relief available\nunder IFRSs. However, the relief is available when the not-for-profit entity is not required to apply such\ninconsistent requirements. This is indicated by footnote to the table in paragraph AG1 of the Australian\napplication guidance added to AASB 127. In this case, the for-profit Tier 1 entity would be able to claim\ncompliance with IFRSs in that the relief is within the scope of the relief available under IFRSs.  \nBC14 The AASB considered the extension of relief to a for-profit Tier 2 parent, investor or venturer that has a notfor-profit ultimate or intermediate parent. The table in the Basis for Conclusions in ED 205 proposed that\nrelief should be available to a parent, investor or venturer in these circumstances, which appears to be\ninconsistent with the circumstances addressed in paragraph BC13. The AASB considered three approaches\nto addressing the apparent inconsistency:  \n(a) amend the table proposed in ED 205 to indicate that the relief would not be available;  \n(b) retain the approach proposed in ED 205, that the relief would be available, and extend the\njustification in the Basis for Conclusions for this position; or  \n(c) retain the approach proposed in ED 205 with no amendment to the justification.  \nBC15 The AASB adopted the approach in paragraph BC14(b), extending the relief, based on its judgement that the\nrelief would be reasonable for Tier 2 parents, investors or venturers despite any differences in the basis of\naccounting in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate or intermediate parent that are publicly\navailable. Typically, the not-for-profit ultimate or intermediate parent would not be able to claim compliance\nwith IFRSs, and the Tier 2 parent, investor or venturer could not do so.  \n-----  ",

Individual Board members gave_\ngreater weight to some factors than to others.  \nBC2 In September 2014, the Board identified that the requirements of AASB 10 _Consolidated Financial_\n_Statements and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures in relation to the requirement for an_\nAustralian parent entity to apply the requirements of AASB 10 and/or AASB 128 when either the parent or\nthe group is a reporting entity, or both the parent and the group are reporting entities, were not aligned.\nSpecifically, AASB 10 requires the ultimate Australian parent to prepare consolidated financial statements,\neven where the entity has a foreign parent that prepares consolidated financial statements that comply with\nIFRSs, when either the parent or the group is a reporting entity or both the parent and the group are reporting\nentities. AASB 128 did not include a similar requirement in relation to the application of the equity method\nby the ultimate Australian parent.  \nBC3 The Board noted that this difference arose when issuing AASB 128 in 2011 in which the Board adopted the\nIFRS wording in IAS 28 paragraph 17(d) without amendment. The superseded AASB 128 Investments in\n_Associates (July 2004) included similar relief for parent entities from applying the equity method in_\naccounting for an interest in an associate or joint venture, but limited that relief to parent entities other than\nthe ultimate Australian parent.  \nBC4 In December 2014 the Board decided that the relief in AASB 128 should apply to the ultimate Australian\nentity, rather than the ultimate Australian parent, to better align the requirements in AASB 128 with the relief\navailable in AASB 10.  \nBC5 The Board decided to conduct further research before deciding whether to undertake a project to reconsider\nwhether to limit the exceptions in AASB 10 and AASB 128 from presenting consolidated financial statements\nor applying the equity method to entities other than the ultimate Australian entity. In the interim, the Board\ndecided to amend AASB 128 to require that the ultimate Australian entity apply the equity method in\naccounting for an interest in an associate or joint venture, to be consistent with the requirement in AASB 10\nfor the ultimate Australian parent to present consolidated financial statements when either the parent or the\ngroup is a reporting entity or both the parent and the group are reporting entities. The amendment aligns the\nrequirements of AASB 10 and AASB 128 in this regard and is substantively consistent with the limitation on\nthe relief previously available to entities under the superseded AASB 128.  \n-----  ",
