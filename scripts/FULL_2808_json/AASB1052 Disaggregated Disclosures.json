To enhance the\nquality of information available for assessing performance, paragraph 15 requires that a summary of the\ngovernment department\u2019s objectives be disclosed in the complete set of financial statements where the\ngovernment department\u2019s annual report does not include this disclosure.  \n18 Paragraphs 15 and 16 require disclosure of information about the expenses, income, assets and liabilities\nattributable to the major activities of a government department for the reporting period. This information is\nrelevant in assessing the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations and of resource allocation\ndecisions. It is also necessary for reviewing existing expenditure commitments and service delivery\narrangements, and for considering the long-term funding implications of new initiatives.  \n19 However, in some instances it may not be possible to reliably attribute all expenses, income, assets and\nliabilities to each of the major activities of a government department. Paragraphs 15 and 16 require that the\ncomplete set of financial statements of a government department only disclose, on an activity by activity\nbasis, information about the expenses, income, assets and liabilities that can be reliably attributed to major\nactivities.",

The Board\nconcluded that differences should be removed, where appropriate and timely, to improve the overall\nquality of financial reporting;  \n(b) bring requirements applicable to local governments, government departments and governments upto-date with contemporary accounting thought;  \n(c) consider the implications of the outcomes of its project on the harmonisation of Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS), in particular on the\nrequirements in AAS 31;  \n(d) decide whether the encouragements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 should be made mandatory or removed;\nand  \n(e) remove uncertainty in the application of cross-references to other Australian Accounting Standards\nand the override provisions in AASs 27, 29 and 31 that made the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and\n31 take precedence over other requirements.  \nBC3 The Board considered the following alternative mechanisms for implementing the approach of updating and\nimproving the requirements for local governments, government departments and governments:  \n(a) review the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 and where appropriate:  \n(i) amend other Australian Accounting Standards to pick up any issues that are addressed in\nAASs 27, 29 and 31 that are not adequately addressed in the latest Australian Accounting\nStandards and have them apply to local governments, government departments and\ngovernments; or  \n(ii) create public sector specific topic-based Standards;  \nand consequently withdraw AASs 27, 29 and 31; or  \n(b) review AASs 27, 29 and 31 and re-issue them in light of the latest Australian Accounting Standards,\nretaining/amending where necessary any issues that are addressed in AASs 27, 29 and 31 that are\nnot adequately addressed in the latest Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC4 The Board chose alternative (a) given the improvements in the quality of financial reporting by local\ngovernments, government departments and governments since AASs 27, 29 and 31 were first issued.  \nBC5 Where the Board identified that the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 could be improved within time and\nresource constraints, improvements have been made. Much of the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 has been\nretained substantively unamended. Improvements will be progressed in due course in line with the AASB\u2019s\nPublic Sector Policy Paper Australian Accounting Standards and Public Sector Entities.  \nBC6 The first stage of the short-term review of the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 was the preparation of a\nparagraph-by-paragraph analysis of each of AASs 27, 29 and 31, listing each paragraph of each Standard\nalongside corresponding Standards or other pronouncements that would apply to local governments,\ngovernment departments or governments in the absence of AASs 27, 29 and 31. The Board\u2019s conclusions\nand rationale for the treatment of each paragraph in the context of the review were also provided in the\nanalysis. The Board\u2019s primary focus was on dealing with the requirements from the three Standards in such\na way as to not leave a vacuum.  \n-----  BC7 Each paragraph from AASs 27, 29 and 31 was classified as being:  \n(a) no longer needed or adequately dealt with in other Standards;  \n(b) more appropriately dealt with in other Standards; or  \n(c) not adequately and/or appropriately dealt with in other Standards and therefore should be retained\nor improved and incorporated into other Standards.  \nThe paragraph-by-paragraph analyses considered by the AASB in developing the Exposure Draft ED 156\n_Proposals Arising from the Short-term Review of the Requirements in AAS 27, AAS 29 and AAS 31 that gave_\nrise to this Standard are available on the AASB website. They support, but do not form part of, this Basis for\nConclusions.  \nBC8 In reviewing the paragraphs, the Board noted that some material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 would, under the\ncurrent style of writing Standards, be located in a separate Basis for Conclusions. Given the short-term nature\nof the review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, the Board concluded that explanations of technical issues that both\noriginated in and are being relocated from AASs 27, 29 and 31 should, when appropriate, be located in the\nbody of the Standard to which they are relocated.  \nBC9 The Board decided not to retain the illustrative general purpose financial reports provided in AASs 27, 29\nand 31, because their purpose, which was to provide an educational tool in the initial stages of accrual\nreporting by local governments, government departments and governments, is no longer needed.  \nBC10 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions focuses on issues specific to disaggregated disclosures.",

        "page_content=": "## Disaggregated Disclosures  \nBC11 The Board decided to retain, substantially unchanged, the requirements relating to segment-like reporting\nfrom paragraphs 86 to 89 of AAS 27 and paragraphs 12.7 to12.7.4 of AAS 29 and relocate them into a separate\nnew topic-based Standard. Because of the differing requirements, the Board concluded that they should be\nexpressed separately for local governments and government departments. A longer-term separate project on\ndisaggregated disclosures for local governments and government departments will be progressed in due\ncourse.  \nBC12 The Board considered relocating the material into AASB 114 Segment Reporting (and subsequently AASB 8\n_Operating Segments), but rejected this option consistent with its intention to retain requirements substantively_\nunchanged in the short term. The guidance in AASB 114 (and AASB 8), which is not applicable to not-forprofit entities or for-profit government departments, comprehensively addresses segment reporting issues and\nspecifies requirements that differ substantially from those required under AASs 27, 29 and 31.  \nBC13 The Board considered whether for-profit government departments should be subject to AASB 114 (and\nAASB8) rather than this Standard. The Board noted that for-profit government departments typically do not\nexist in practice. Consistent with the general approach to the short-term review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, and\nbecause AAS 29 applied to government departments, including for-profit government departments, the Board\ndecided that for-profit government departments should continue to adopt policies that are consistent with notfor-profit government departments to the extent previously required by AAS 29. This approach will be\nreviewed as part of the Board\u2019s longer-term consideration of the definition of government departments in the\ncontext of the reporting entity concept.  \nBC14 Paragraph 12.7.2 of AAS 29 encouraged the disclosure of information about assets deployed and liabilities\nincurred in relation to each major activity undertaken by a government department. Consistent with paragraph\nBC2(d), the Board decided that, in relation to disaggregated information, assets deployed and liabilities\nincurred in relation to and reliably attributable to each major activity undertaken by a government department\nshould be required to be disclosed (see paragraph 16). The information is relevant in assessing the\neffectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations and of resource allocation decisions.  \nBC15 The Board decided not to retain the requirements relating to segment-like reporting from paragraphs 15.12 to\n15.12.2 of AAS 31. It is not necessary for this Standard to specify disaggregated disclosure requirements for\ngovernments, as AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector _Financial Reporting_\naddresses disaggregated disclosure requirements for governments.  \n-----  ",
