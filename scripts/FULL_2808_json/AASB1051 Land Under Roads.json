The main differences between AASB 1051_\nand AASs 27, 29 and 31 (as amended) are:  \n(a) this Standard extends indefinitely the relief from the requirement to recognise land under roads acquired\nbefore the end of the first reporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007. AASs 27, 29 and 31\nprovided recognition relief only for a transitional period;  \n(b) AASs 27, 29 and 31 encouraged entities to recognise land under roads as an asset wherever it can be\nmeasured reliably. Consistent with the AASB\u2019s policy of not including encouragements within Standards,\nthis encouragement has not been included in this Standard;  \n(c) this Standard notes that AASB 116 _Property, Plant and Equipment_ applies to land under roads acquired\nafter the end of the first reporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007. AASs 27, 29 and 31 would\nhave required that AASB 116 be retrospectively applied to land under roads after the end of the transitional\nperiod;  \n(d) in certain circumstances this Standard allows an entity, in relation to land under roads acquired before the\nend of the first reporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007, to elect to adopt the fair value (as at\nthe date of that election) or a previous revaluation under the \u201cfair value or revaluation as deemed cost\u201d\nexemptions contained in AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial\n_Reporting Standards, as if it were adopting Australian equivalents to IFRSs for the first time. AASs 27, 29_\nand 31 did not contain this relief;  \n(e) AASs 29 and 31 did not explicitly require that, if the recognised amounts of land under roads acquired\nbefore the end of the first reporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007 are revised, up until the\nfirst day of the next reporting period, to reflect a reassessment of the factors used to determine those\nrecognised amounts, the net amount of the resultant adjustments be made against accumulated surplus\n(deficiency) in the reporting periods in which the recognised amounts are revised; and  \n(f) this Standard extends the requirements to General Government Sectors.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC2 The Board considered it timely to review the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31, in particular to:  \n(a) review the extent to which local governments, government departments and governments should\ncontinue to be subject to requirements that differ from requirements applicable to other not-forprofit entities and for-profit entities contained in Australian Accounting Standards. The Board\nconcluded that differences should be removed, where appropriate and timely, to improve the\noverall quality of financial reporting;  \n(b) bring requirements applicable to local governments, government departments and governments\nup-to-date with contemporary accounting thought;  \n(c) consider the implications of the outcomes of its project on the harmonisation of Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS), in particular\non the requirements in AAS 31;  \n(d) decide whether the encouragements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 should be made mandatory or\nremoved; and  \n(e) remove uncertainty in the application of cross-references to other Australian Accounting\nStandards and the override provisions in AASs 27, 29 and 31 that made the requirements in\nAASs 27, 29 and 31 take precedence over other requirements.  \nBC3 The Board considered the following alternative mechanisms for implementing the approach of updating and\nimproving the requirements for local governments, government departments and governments:  \n(a) review the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 and where appropriate:  \n(i) amend other Australian Accounting Standards to pick up any issues that are addressed\nin AASs 27, 29 and 31 that are not adequately addressed in the latest Australian\nAccounting Standards and have them apply to local governments, government\ndepartments and governments; or  \n(ii) create public sector specific topic-based Standards; and consequently withdraw\nAASs 27, 29 and 31; or  \n(b) review AASs 27, 29 and 31 and re-issue them in light of the latest Australian Accounting\nStandards, retaining/amending where necessary any issues that are addressed in AASs 27, 29 and\n31 that are not adequately addressed in the latest Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC4 The Board chose alternative (a) given the improvements in the quality of financial reporting by local\ngovernments, government departments and governments since AASs 27, 29 and 31 were first issued.  \nBC5 Where the Board identified that the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 could be improved within time and\nresource constraints, improvements have been made. Much of the material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 has been\nretained substantively unamended. Improvements will be progressed in due course in line with the AASB\u2019s\nPublic Sector Policy Paper Australian Accounting Standards and Public Sector Entities.  \nBC6 The first stage of the short-term review of the requirements in AASs 27, 29 and 31 was the preparation of a\nparagraph-by-paragraph analysis of each of AASs 27, 29 and 31, listing each paragraph of each Standard\nalongside corresponding Standards or other pronouncements that would apply to local governments,\ngovernment departments or governments in the absence of AASs 27, 29 and 31. The Board\u2019s conclusions\nand rationale for the treatment of each paragraph in the context of the review were also provided in the  \n-----  analysis. The Board\u2019s primary focus was on dealing with the requirements from the three Standards in such\na way as to not leave a vacuum.  \nBC7 Each paragraph from AASs 27, 29 and 31 was classified as being:  \n(a) no longer needed or adequately dealt with in other Standards;  \n(b) more appropriately dealt with in other Standards; or  \n(c) not adequately and/or appropriately dealt with in other Standards and therefore should be retained\nor improved and incorporated into other Standards.  \nThe paragraph-by-paragraph analyses considered by the AASB in developing the Exposure Draft ED 156\n_Proposals Arising from the Short-term Review of the Requirements in AAS 27, AAS 29 and AAS 31 that_\ngave rise to this Standard are available on the AASB website. They support, but do not form part of, this\nBasis for Conclusions.  \nBC8 In reviewing the paragraphs, the Board noted that some material in AASs 27, 29 and 31 would, under the\ncurrent style of writing Standards, be located in a separate Basis for Conclusions. Given the short-term\nnature of the review of AASs 27, 29 and 31, the Board concluded that explanations of technical issues that\nboth originated in and are being relocated from AASs 27, 29 and 31 should, when appropriate, be located in\nthe body of the Standard to which the relevant requirements are being relocated.  \nBC9 The Board decided not to retain the illustrative general purpose financial reports provided in AASs 27, 29\nand 31, because their purpose, which was to provide an educational tool in the initial stages of accrual\nreporting by local governments, government departments and governments, is no longer needed.  \nBC10 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions focuses on issues specific to land under roads.",

        "page_content=": "## Land Under Roads  \nBC11 The Board decided to issue this Standard as part of the short-term review of the requirements in AASs 27,\n29 and 31 and to amend the previous transitional relief for land under roads, to allow entities to elect\nwhether to recognise land under roads acquired before the end of the first reporting period ending on or\nafter 31 December 2007. This decision is in acknowledgement of the potentially onerous demands on\nentities if they were to be required to retrospectively identify, assess the recognition criteria, recognise and\nmeasure land under roads previously acquired.  \nBC12 The Board decided that a final election relating to the recognition of land under roads acquired before the\nend of the first reporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007 should be made effective as at the\nfirst day of the next reporting period. The final election can be made at any time prior to the completion of\nthe financial statements for that next reporting period, but will be effective as at the first day of that period.\nThe Board also decided that, to facilitate the transition to the new requirements, any adjustments arising\nfrom an election be made against accumulated surplus (deficiency); and that there would be no requirement\nto adjust comparative data for earlier periods when the election is made effective as at that first day. The\nBoard noted that the extent to which an entity could change its recognition policy after that date would be\nconstrained by the requirements of AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and\n_Errors relating to voluntary change in accounting policy. Accordingly, subsequent changes to the_\naccounting policy relating to the recognition of land under roads acquired before the end of the first\nreporting period ending on or after 31 December 2007 could only be made to recognise land under roads\nthat it previously elected to not recognise (or, conceivably, vice versa) if that change could be justified\nbased on paragraph 14 of AASB 108.  \nBC13 Consistent with the entities that were subject to AASs 27, 29 and 31, this Standard applies to local\ngovernments, government departments (including for-profit government departments), and whole of\ngovernments. In addition, the application of this Standard extends to General Government Sectors (GGSs),\nwhich facilitates consistency in financial reporting by GGSs and whole of governments.  \nBC14 In relation to GGSs and whole of governments, the Board considered the relationship between this Standard\nand the principle in AASB 1049 _Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial_\n_Reporting that GGSs and whole of governments should adopt optional treatments in Australian Accounting_\nStandards that align with the principles or rules in the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Government\nFinance Statistics (GFS) Manual. The Board noted that the recognition relief provided in this Standard for\nland under roads is potentially inconsistent with GFS principles. However, the Board also noted that land\nunder roads is not recognised under GFS in practice in certain circumstances, depending on the availability\nof information pertinent to measurement. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the impact of AASB 1049\nrelative to this Standard on the recognition of land under roads would be expected to be limited.  \n-----  BC15 Accordingly, the Board decided that the broad principle adopted in AASB 1049 that a GAAP option should\nbe adopted where it aligns with GFS should be retained without an exception for land under roads. In\nmaking this decision, the Board also noted that any difference between GFS principles and practice is\nbeyond the control of the AASB, and that land under roads does not create unique issues in a GAAP/GFS\nharmonisation context.  \nBC16 The Board concluded that, in principle, land under roads is property and therefore falls within the scope of\nAASB 116. Accordingly, it is appropriate that land under roads acquired after the end of the first reporting\nperiod ending on or after 31 December 2007 is accounted for in accordance with AASB 116. In making\nthis decision, the Board noted that AASB 116, including paragraph Aus15.1, requires:  \n(a) assets acquired at no cost, or for a nominal cost, to be initially measured at fair value as at the\ndate of acquisition where fair value can be measured reliably; and  \n(b) requires assets acquired at a cost to be initially measured at cost, but does not require adoption of\nthe revaluation model. The Board also noted that issues relating to reliable measurement of fair\nvalue are not unique to land under roads and therefore could be dealt with in the same manner in\nwhich issues for other classes of assets are dealt with under AASB 116.  \nBC17 The Board also concluded that further requirements should replicate, in certain circumstances, the fair value\nor a previous revaluation (in accordance with, for example, AASB 1041 Revaluation of Non-Current Assets\nor AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment) under the \u201cfair value or revaluation as deemed cost\u201d\nexemptions in AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting\n_Standards on the basis that this would facilitate the initial recognition of land under roads under AASB 116._\nThe requirements would be used when a local government, government department, GGS or whole of\ngovernment elects to recognise and measure land under roads acquired before the end of the first reporting\nperiod ending on or after 31 December 2007 under paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Standard, after its first-time\nadoption of Australian equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards.  \n-----  ",
