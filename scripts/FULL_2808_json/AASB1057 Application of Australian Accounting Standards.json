Individual Board\nmembers gave greater weight to some factors than to others.  \nBC2 In 2005 when Australia transitioned to adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs),\nAustralian Accounting Standards (including Interpretations) were issued using IFRSs as a base. Australianspecific paragraphs (labelled as \u2018Aus\u2019 paragraphs), including application paragraphs, were added to the\nIFRS text. These application paragraphs identified, in each Standard, the entities and financial reports to\nwhich the Standard applied. For example, most Standards apply explicitly to reporting entities and to\ngeneral purpose financial statements. Other minor amendments were also made to the IFRS text (eg\nAustralian terminology and punctuation).  \nBC3 At its May 2015 meeting, the Board decided to revise Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate\nIFRSs to minimise Australian-specific wording even further. Therefore, because IFRSs do not contain such\napplication paragraphs, the application paragraphs that were previously in each Australian Accounting\nStandard were moved to this Standard. In doing so, the application requirements have not been amended.\nThese application paragraphs also do not affect requirements in other Standards that specify that certain\nparagraphs apply only to certain types of entities.  \nBC4 For consistency, the application paragraphs of Australian-specific Standards have also been included in this\nStandard, without amendment. When those Standards are amended for other reasons, their application\nparagraphs are expected to be removed.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Reasons for issuing this Standard  \nBC2 The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a revised Conceptual Framework titled\n_Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (the revised Conceptual Framework) in March 2018._  \nBC3 The Conceptual Framework describes the objective and concepts for general purpose financial reporting\nunder International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards). Its purpose is to assist standard-setters\nto develop Standards that are based on consistent concepts, and to help preparers develop consistent\naccounting policies when no Standard applies to a particular transaction or event, or when a Standard allows\na choice of accounting policy. It also assists anyone looking to understand and interpret the Standards.  \nBC4 Making the IASB\u2019s revised Conceptual Framework applicable in Australia is essential. In accordance with\nthe Financial Reporting Council\u2019s strategic direction to the Board and the Board\u2019s strategic objectives, the\nBoard should:  \n(a) maintain compliance with IFRS Standards for publicly accountable entities; and  \n(b) use IFRS Standards as a base for determining the reporting requirements for all other entities,\nmodified as appropriate, in accordance with the AASB\u2019s standard-setting frameworks for forprofit and not-for-profit entities.  \nBC5 Implementation of the revised Conceptual Framework in Australia is challenging due to the so-called\n\u2018reporting entity clash\u2019. This reflects the difference between the definition of a \u2018reporting entity\u2019 in the\nIASB\u2019s revised Conceptual Framework and the current definition in Australian Accounting Standards\n(including Interpretations). The reporting entity definition in the revised Conceptual Framework determines\nthe boundary of what needs to be reported when an entity is required to report, e.g. consolidation. The\ncurrent reporting entity definition in Australian Accounting Standards determines whether an entity should\nprepare general purpose financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC6 In applying the Board\u2019s normal practice of transaction neutrality based on IFRS Standards, the Board noted\nthat resolving the reporting entity clash required removing the Australian definition of reporting entity. To\ndo this would also remove the ability of an entity to conclude that it is not a reporting entity as currently\ndefined, and so prevent it from preparing special purpose financial statements if it is required to prepare\nfinancial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC7 The Board noted that having two conceptual frameworks in operation at the same time would introduce\nsome complexity to Australian Accounting Standards, and is not desirable for a long period of time.\nConsequently, to implement the revised Conceptual Framework in the short term, the Board decided to\nfollow a phased approach:  \n(a) Phase 1 \u2013 implement the revised Conceptual Framework for publicly accountable for-profit\nprivate sector entities so that they can maintain compliance with IFRS Standards. The Board\nnoted that there may also be for-profit entities in the public sector that wish to maintain\ncompliance with IFRS Standards. Phase 1 would permit these entities to adopt the revised\nConceptual Framework on a voluntary basis; and  \n(b) Phase 2 \u2013 implement the revised Conceptual Framework for all other entities, and remove the\nability for entities to prepare special purpose financial statements when they are required to\nprepare financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.  \n-----  BC8 The Board expected that implementing the revised Conceptual Framework for publicly accountable forprofit private sector entities would be straightforward as such entities were, in the Board\u2019s view, required by\nAustralian Accounting Standards to prepare Tier 1 general purpose financial statements applying all of the\naccounting standards. As such the Board did not expect the reporting entity concept to be relevant to them.  \nBC9 The phased approach would also provide the Board with more time to develop additional Australianspecific paragraphs for the revised Conceptual Framework in respect of not-for-profit entities in the private\nand public sectors and for-profit public sector entities, as part of Phase 2.",

In developing the proposals in ITC_\n39, the Board considered the findings of various research projects it had initiated. This included AASB\nResearch Report No. 1 _Application of the Reporting Entity Concept and Lodgement of Special Purpose_\n_Financial Statements (June 2014) and AASB Research Report No. 6_ _Financial Reporting Requirements_\n_Applicable to Public Sector Entities (May 2018)._  \nBC11 ITC 39 considered five alternatives for implementing the revised Conceptual Framework in Australia:  \n(a) Option 1 \u2013 Adopt a two-phased approach to applying the revised Conceptual Framework. This\noption would implement the revised Conceptual Framework for for-profit publicly accountable\nentities and other entities voluntarily claiming compliance with IFRS Standards in Phase 1. It\nwould then implement the revised Conceptual Framework for all other entities in Phase 2. Phase\n2 would remove the Australian reporting entity concept and remove the ability of an entity to\nprepare special purpose financial statements as a non-reporting entity where they are required to\ncomply with Australian Accounting Standards.  \n(b) Option 2 \u2013 Operate with two conceptual frameworks. This option would implement the revised\nConceptual Framework for publicly accountable for-profit entities and other entities voluntarily\nreporting compliance with IFRS Standards. It would also retain the _Framework for the_\n_Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (the existing Conceptual Framework) for_\nall other entities.  \n(c) Option 3 \u2013 Implement the revised Conceptual Framework for all entities when it first becomes\napplicable to maintain compliance with IFRS Standards and IFRS Standards as a base for\nAustralian Accounting Standards. This option would remove the Australian reporting entity\nconcept and the ability of an entity to prepare special purpose financial statements as a nonreporting entity where they are required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards from 1\nJanuary 2020.  \n(d) Option 4 \u2013 Retain the existing Conceptual Framework, the Australian reporting entity concept\nand the ability of an entity to prepare special purpose financial statements as a non-reporting\nentity where they are required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards. Under this\noption, compliance with Australian Accounting Standards might not result in compliance with\nIFRS Standards after 1 January 2020.  \n(e) Option 5 \u2013 Implement the revised Conceptual Framework from 1 January 2020 when it first\nbecomes applicable to maintain compliance with IFRS Standards and IFRS Standards as a base\nfor Australian Accounting Standards. Under Option 5, the Australian reporting entity concept\nwould be retained but the name amended and minimum requirements for special purpose\nfinancial statements would be prescribed by the Board.  \nBC12 The Board considered the benefits of and barriers to each of these options, and supported Option 1 as its\npreferred approach. Option 1 is the Board\u2019s preferred approach because it:  \n(a) allows for-profit entities with public accountability and entities that voluntarily report compliance\nwith IFRS Standards to continue to do so;  \n(b) allows all other entities to continue preparing special purpose financial statements in the short\nterm while the Board undertakes consultation and outreach activities and determines the\nappropriate Tier 2 general purpose financial statements framework to replace special purpose\nfinancial statements;  \n-----  (c) maintains IFRS Standards as a base for all entities in the medium term;  \n(d) solves the reporting entity problem in the medium term;  \n(e) solves the special purpose financial statements problem in the medium term;  \n(f) allows time for the Board to consult and determine any not-for-profit modifications that may be\nnecessary to the revised Conceptual Framework in accordance with The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit\nEntity Standard-Setting Framework; and  \n(g) facilitates comparability and ensures there are appropriate accounting standards for each type of\nentity required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC13 ITC 39 noted the importance of maintaining compliance with IFRS Standards for certain entities in\nAustralia. As Australian Accounting Standards incorporate IFRS Standards, compliance with Australian\nAccounting Standards (Tier 1) results in compliance with IFRS Standards for for-profit entities.\nCompliance with Australian Accounting Standards is often required by legislation.  \nBC14 When deciding that Phase 1 should be limited to for-profit entities with public accountability, the Board\nreconfirmed the importance of the definition of public accountability included in _International Financial_\n_Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs). Internationally, entities with_\npublic accountability must apply the full IFRS Standards, rather than the _IFRS for SMEs. Therefore the_\nBoard reconfirmed its view that for-profit entities in Australia with public accountability (as defined) should\nbe required to prepare Tier 1 general purpose financial statements. Due to the importance of the IFRS for\n_SMEs definition of public accountability, the Board decided that the IASB\u2019s amendments to the definition_\nof public accountability should be reflected in the definition included in AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of\n_Australian Accounting Standards._",

The Board\nalso obtained feedback via means such as emails, meetings with constituents and feedback from external\npresentations. The responses to ITC 39 indicated that:  \n(a) on balance, the majority of the respondents were supportive of the proposals in Phase 1 and the\nneed to issue the revised Conceptual Framework in Australia prior to 1 January 2020 so that\nentities with public accountability could continue to maintain compliance with IFRS Standards;  \n(b) there are a number of entities that may be affected by Phase 1 and the reporting entity clash of\nwhich the Board was unaware when developing ITC 39;  \n(c) maintaining two conceptual frameworks was not without its complexities; and  \n(d) mandatory application of the revised Conceptual Framework in Phase 1 should be limited to forprofit private sector entities with public accountability that are required by legislation to prepare\nfinancial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC17 The Board considered these issues as well as a range of other issues identified by constituents in developing\nthis Standard following the ITC 39 exposure process.

Respondents\nalso indicated that additional guidance would be useful to assist them in determining whether an entity\nmeets the definition of \u2018public accountability\u2019.  \nBC19 Due to the importance of the definition of publicly accountability in Australia, the Board decided to amend\nthe definition in AASB 1053 to align with the revised definition per the IFRS for SMEs when the revised\nConceptual Framework is issued. The revised definition confirms that an entity has publicly accountability\nif it has debt or equity instruments that are traded in a public market or it is in the process of issuing such\ninstruments for trading in a public market. An entity also has public accountability if it holds assets in a\nfiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders as one of its primary businesses.  \n-----  BC20 The Board decided that further guidance on these matters, as well as a number of other aspects of the public\naccountability definition, should be addressed through a public accountability sub-project. This sub-project\nwill consider, in accordance with The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework, whether\nthere should be any changes to the types of entities that are deemed to have public accountability (an\nAustralian decision), whether exemptions from the public accountability definition would be in the\nAustralian public interest and whether additional guidance should be included to assist in interpreting the\npublic accountability definition in an Australian context.",

        "page_content=": "## Significant issues  \n### Scope\n_Entities that may be affected by Phase 1_  \nBC21 Entities identified by respondents as potentially being affected by Phase 1 included unlisted entities that\nmay be operating in over-the-counter markets (e.g. securitisation trusts), small internally held registered\nmanaged investment schemes, certain public sector trust entities, companies raising crowd-sourced equity\nfunding and corporate collective investment vehicles.  \n_Securitisation trusts_  \nBC22 Securitisation trusts are listed, unquoted special purpose vehicles structured through a trust, established to\nfacilitate the issue of asset-backed securities. Securitisation trusts are themselves unlisted, however they\nissue debt instruments which are listed on the ASX and/or another securities exchange. They have no\nlegislative requirement to prepare financial statements. Their financial reporting obligations are governed\nby their trust deed and ASX listing rules, and they may be preparing special purpose financial statements if\nthey have determined in accordance with SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity that there are no external\nusers dependent on their general purpose financial statements.  \nBC23 Securitisation trusts undertake over-the-counter (i.e. unquoted) transactions, and while the trustee (a third\nparty) is responsible for maintaining the register of investors, investment is often made via custodian\nentities, making the ultimate holder of asset-backed securities difficult to identify.  \nBC24 Respondents to ITC 39 sought clarification regarding whether securitisation trusts were considered to have\npublic accountability. For the Board to determine whether or not securitisation trusts are publicly\naccountable would require an interpretation of facts and circumstances. Further, the matter would need to\nbe assessed against the principles of the Interpretations and Improvements Model. The Interpretations and\n_Improvements Model states that issues relating to the interpretation of IFRS Standards would be referred to_\nthe International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) for its consideration. However,\nprior to this, the Board needed to assess the issue against specific criteria, the first of which is whether the\nissue is widespread and has practical relevance. As there were only 126 securitisation trusts listed on the\nASX (in August 2018), the issue was not considered widespread and therefore would not meet the\nrequirements of the _Interpretations and Improvements Model. The Board also noted that its decision to_\nlimit the scope of Phase 1 to entities required by legislation to prepare financial statements would mean that\nthese trusts would be considered as part of Phase 2.  \n_Small internally held registered managed investment schemes (MIS)_  \nBC25 Some internal registered MIS are currently preparing special purpose financial statements to satisfy the\nreporting requirements of the _Corporations Act 2001 as they have determined in accordance with SAC 1_\nthat there are no external users of their financial statements. These internal registered MIS only accept\ninvestments from other entities within their group, however they are required to be registered under the\n_Corporations Act 2001. Appendix B of AASB 1053 deems registered MIS to have public accountability._  \nBC26 When the Board developed its approach to differential reporting, registered MIS were deemed to be\npublicly accountable in the Australian context as a means of clarifying the IASB definition of public\naccountability. At the time, registered MIS were seen as being the Australian equivalents of mutual funds\nin other jurisdictions as they were expected to hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of\noutsiders. However, due to the nature of these internal registered MIS, it is possible that they may not have\npublic accountability as defined, as they may not hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of\noutsiders. The question of whether all registered MIS should continue to be deemed to have public\naccountability will be revisited as part of the public accountability sub-project.  \n_Unlisted trusts maintained by State Governments_  \nBC27 Respondents also identified that some State Governments have established unlisted investment trusts under\nState legislation to hold investments in various types of assets, such as infrastructure. Some investments are  \n-----  held in partnership or joint venture with external parties, such as superannuation funds. These trusts are forprofit public sector entities. They do not have a legislative requirement to prepare financial statements, with\ntheir financial reporting obligations directed by their Trust Deed.  \nBC28 These trusts are currently preparing special purpose financial statements on the basis that they are not\nreporting entities. However, as they are holding assets in a fiduciary capacity, they may be considered to\nhave public accountability under the definition in the IFRS for SMEs. The Board noted that its decision to\nlimit the scope of Phase 1 to entities required by legislation to prepare financial statements would mean that\nthese trusts would be considered as part of Phase 2.  \n_Legislation versus constituting documents_  \nBC29 Respondents to ITC 39 identified some entities that may be affected by the amendments proposed in\nPhase 1, including trusts that are required by their constitutional document (rather than legislation) to\nprepare financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards. They do not have any\nlegislative requirement to prepare such financial statements and may be preparing special purpose financial\nstatements. This includes securitisation trusts and certain public sector trusts.  \nBC30 The Board noted that while changing constitutional documents is possible, it can be onerous and if not done\ncorrectly can have tax consequences. Many trust deeds may have template wording referring to compliance\nwith Australian Accounting Standards without the trustees or the beneficiaries having considered whether\nthis would need to involve the preparation of general purpose financial statements. Based on feedback\nobtained from targeted outreach activities, these trusts may provide detailed information to their\nbeneficiaries about their financial performance and position on a regular basis.  \nBC31 _The AASB\u2019s_ _For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework requires publicly accountable for-profit entities_\nto prepare Tier 1 general purpose financial statements on the basis that these entities would need to state\ncompliance with IFRS Standards. However, entities that do not have any legislative requirement to prepare\nfinancial statements and are required only by their constitution or trust deed to comply with Australian\nAccounting Standards often will not need to confirm compliance with IFRS Standards.  \nBC32 _The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework further notes that publicly accountable entities_\nshould prepare Tier 1 general purpose financial statements as these types of entities would have a\nsignificant impact on the Australian economy and therefore should be subject to the highest level of\naccountability. However, where entities are required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards only\nas a result of their constitution or trust deed, and their members have in the past been comfortable with the\namount of information provided in the form of special purpose financial statements, the Board did not\nconsider it appropriate to mandate the preparation of Tier 1 general purpose financial statements for such\nentities as part of Phase 1.  \nBC33 Consequently, Phase 1 is intended to allow entities to maintain compliance with IFRS Standards, not to\nextend requirements for entities to prepare general purpose financial statements if they are not currently\nrequired by legislation to prepare financial statements. To ensure that Phase 1 did not unintentionally\nrequire such entities to prepare general purpose financial statements, the Board decided to limit Phase 1 to\nfor-profit private sector entities that have public accountability and are required by legislation to comply\nwith Australian Accounting Standards. This ensures the reporting requirements of entities with public\naccountability that do not have a legislative requirement to prepare financial statements will not be affected\nby Phase 1. The appropriateness of this limitation will however be reconsidered as part of Phase 2 after\nfurther research and outreach. The Board also confirmed that those for-profit entities wanting to voluntarily\ncomply with Tier 1 and IFRS Standards should be permitted to do so, including for-profit entities in the\npublic sector.",

That is, unlike in Option 1, it would not be addressed via an AusCF1 paragraph.|Tolerated in Phase 1. That is, unlike in Option 2, it would not be addressed via an AusCF1 paragraph.|  \nBC35 If Option 1 was adopted, it would result in two conceptual frameworks. The revised Conceptual\nFramework would be applied by for-profit private sector entities that have public accountability and are\nrequired by legislation to comply with Australian Accounting Standards. Other for-profit entities could\nelect to apply the revised Conceptual Framework voluntarily. All other entities would continue to apply the\nexisting Conceptual Framework. To operate two conceptual frameworks with only one set of Australian\nAccounting Standards (including Interpretations), the basic text of each Australian Accounting Standard\nwould be updated for consistency with the IASB\u2019s consequential amendments. The existing, preamendment text would also be retained, with the paragraph or footnote given an \u2018AusCF\u2019 prefix. Australian\nAccounting Standards that do not have an equivalent IFRS Standard and future consequential amendments\nwould be addressed in the same way. To address the reporting entity clash, entities applying the revised\nConceptual Framework would no longer apply the reporting entity concept in SAC 1. Instead, these entities\nwould refer to Chapter 3 of the revised Conceptual Framework to determine what the term reporting entity  \n1 Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity\n2 Chapter 3 Financial Statements and the Reporting Entity\n3 AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards  \n-----  means for them. Entities applying the existing Conceptual Framework would continue referring to the\nreporting entity definition in AASB 1057 and SAC 1.  \nBC36 If Option 2 was adopted, it would result in the revised Conceptual Framework being applied either in full or\nin part by all entities. For-profit private sector entities that have public accountability and are required by\nlegislation to comply with Australian Accounting Standards would adopt the revised Conceptual\nFramework in full. Other for-profit entities could also elect to do so voluntarily. All other entities would\napply the revised Conceptual Framework, except for Chapter 3. Instead, these entities would refer to SAC 1\nfor the definition of the term reporting entity. This would address the reporting entity clash.  \nBC37 Option 3 is similar to Option 1 as it would result in two conceptual frameworks, however unlike Option 1,\nOption 3 would result in two sets of Australian Accounting Standards. One set would be amended for\nentities adopting the revised Conceptual Framework. The second set would be frozen at the date the revised\nConceptual Framework was issued, and would be applied by entities continuing to apply the existing\nConceptual Framework. Option 3 would not address the reporting entity clash.  \nBC38 Option 4 is similar to Option 2, as it would result in a single conceptual framework, however similarly to\nOption 3, it would result in up to two sets of Australian Accounting Standards. Option 4, like Option 3,\nwould not address the reporting entity clash.  \nBC39 While Option 1 results in there being two conceptual frameworks in operation for a period of time and does\nnot resolve the reporting entity clash in the immediate term, the Board decided that it was the most\nappropriate Phase 1 approach for the following reasons:  \n(a) the application of the two conceptual frameworks is clearly defined and is less likely to cause\nconfusion for constituents;  \n(b) Option 1 would address the reporting entity clash in the medium term;  \n(c) Option 1 would be more straightforward to unwind when implementing Phase 2;  \n(d) the revised Conceptual Framework contains new recognition and measurement requirements for\nassets, liabilities, income and expenses. Unless an entity is applying the revised Conceptual\nFramework, it is not required to adopt those revised recognition and measurement requirements\nuntil Phase 2 is implemented. That is, for entities applying the existing Conceptual Framework,\nthe existing Conceptual Framework and the related references in Australian Accounting\nStandards are effectively frozen; and  \n(e) there is no need to consider whether other aspects of the revised Conceptual Framework need to\nbe amended to accommodate retaining SAC 1, which includes the Australian definition of the\nterm reporting entity.  \nBC40 While Option 2 would result in a single conceptual framework, and would address the reporting entity\nclash, the Board decided that Option 2 was more likely to create confusion amongst constituents. This is\nbecause under Option 2 it is less clear which elements of the revised Conceptual Framework would apply to\ncertain entities and which would not. Also, other entities would be required to apply the new recognition\nand measurement requirements in the revised Conceptual Framework in circumstances where an Australian\nAccounting Standard (or Interpretation) did not address an issue. In addition, extensive work would be\nrequired to review all aspects of the revised Conceptual Framework to determine what other changes would\nbe necessary to accommodate retaining SAC 1 and the Australian definition of the term reporting entity.  \nBC41 The Board did not consider Option 3 or Option 4 to be viable, as both options would result in two sets of\nAustralian Accounting Standards, which would be complex to manage (for example future compilations)\nand would present a much greater level of confusion for stakeholders in knowing which set of Australian\nAccounting Standards they should use. The existence of two sets of Australian Accounting Standards\nwould also be challenging when implementing Phase 2.",

        "page_content=": "### Phase 1 approach\nBC42 Implementation of Option 1 in Phase 1 requires identification of all references to the existing Conceptual\nFramework in each Australian pronouncement and all references to the term reporting entity.  \nBC43 Implementation of two conceptual frameworks and one set of Australian Accounting Standards requires all\nreferences to the existing Conceptual Framework to be updated as references to the revised Conceptual\nFramework, with limited exceptions, for those entities applying the revised Conceptual Framework. For all\nentities that are not applying the revised Conceptual Framework, references to the existing Conceptual\nFramework need to be retained.  \n-----  BC44 The Board determined the most effective way to achieve this required:  \n(a) updating the basic text of all Australian Accounting Standards to reflect the IASB\u2019s amendments\nconsequential to the revised Conceptual Framework, that is, all references to the existing\nConceptual Framework were replaced with a reference to the revised Conceptual Framework,\nwith limited exceptions. The basic text of all Australian Accounting Standards applies to entities\napplying the revised Conceptual Framework. This ensures that compliance with Australian\nAccounting Standards (Tier 1) by these entities continues to result in compliance with IFRS\nStandards;  \n(b) adding an AusCF paragraph or footnote in each Australian Accounting Standard that was updated\nper paragraph (a). The AusCF paragraph or footnote retained the same number, but was given an\nAusCF prefix. AusCF paragraphs retained the references to the existing Conceptual Framework\nand are applicable only to entities applying the existing Conceptual Framework; and  \n(c) inserting an AusCF1 paragraph into each Australian Accounting Standard that contained a\nreference to the existing Conceptual Framework or contained the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019. Two\nversions of paragraph AusCF1 were used:  \n(i) one version states that the requirements of the AusCF paragraphs and footnotes added\nto the Standard apply only to those entities that are applying the existing Conceptual\nFramework. It also directs entities applying the existing Conceptual Framework to\nAASB 1057 and SAC 1 for the definition of the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019; and  \n(ii) a second version is used where no other AusCF paragraphs or footnotes were added to\nthe Standard but the Standard contains the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019. This version merely\ndirects entities applying the existing Conceptual Framework to AASB 1057 and SAC 1\nfor the definition of the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019.  \nBC45 To maintain IFRS compliance, there are some instances where it is not necessary or not appropriate to\nupdate a reference to the existing Conceptual Framework to a reference to the revised Conceptual\nFramework (these references were not updated in the consequential amendments made by the IASB to IFRS\nStandards). These include:  \n(a) references to the existing Conceptual Framework in AASB 3 Business Combinations (paragraph\n11), AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (paragraph_\n54G) in relation to developing accounting policies for regulatory balances, AASB 137 Provisions,\n_Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (paragraph 10) and AASB 138_ _Intangible Assets_\n(paragraph 8) continue to use the definition of a liability and an asset contained in the existing\nConceptual Framework;  \n(b) an existing Conceptual Framework reference that presents the definition of an asset, liability,\nincome or expense in its requirements, so that updating the reference may potentially change the\naccounting consequences of the Australian Accounting Standard. In these cases, the Australian\nAccounting Standard will continue to refer to the existing Conceptual Framework for the relevant\ndefinition; and  \n(c) references to the existing Conceptual Framework in Interpretations, which the IASB amended to\nrefer to the Conceptual Framework in effect when the Interpretation was developed.\nConsequently, the Board also amended the references to the existing Conceptual Framework in its\nAustralian Interpretations to refer to the Conceptual Framework in effect when the Interpretation\nwas developed.  \nReferences to the existing Conceptual Framework that are historical (ie fixed in time) rather than required to\nupdate automatically for subsequent versions of the Conceptual Framework do not include the reference to\nidentification in accordance with AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards. Such a reference to AASB 1048\nwould automatically update the reference to the Conceptual Framework when a new version of the\nConceptual Framework is listed in AASB 1048. Most references to the existing and revised Conceptual\nFrameworks therefore include the AASB 1048 reference.  \nBC46 Existing Conceptual Framework references contained in requirements specific to not-for-profit entities were\nalso not updated. Although amendments will be made to the revised Conceptual Framework for not-forprofit entities in due course, they have not yet been considered as the adoption of the revised Conceptual\nFramework in Phase 1 is limited to for-profit entities.  \nBC47 Based on feedback received on ITC 39, the Board noted that AASB 1053 paragraph 11 regarding the\napplication of Tier 1 reporting requirements is not operating as intended to require entities with public\naccountability to prepare general purpose financial statements. The Board determined that the amended\nrequirement would be limited to those entities scoped into Phase 1 to avoid unintended consequences.  \n-----  _Public sector entities_  \nBC48 The definition of public accountability in IFRS for SMEs was developed by the IASB for for-profit private\nsector entities. When discussing AASB 1053, the Board considered whether the definition of public\naccountability should also be applied to public sector entities. However, the Board decided against this for\nthe following reasons:  \nThe Board concluded that, consistent with the role of other regulators under the revised differential\nreporting framework (see paragraphs BC40-BC41), the determination of the Tiers of reporting\nrequirements under which for-profit public sector entities should report would best be left to\nrelevant public sector regulators in each jurisdiction. (AASB 1053, paragraph BC38).  \nThe Board did not consider that there was any reason to revisit this decision.  \nBC49 When discussing the application of Phase 1 of ITC 39 to entities in the public sector, the Board did not\nintend to force any for-profit public sector entity to adopt the revised Conceptual Framework for periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2020. The Phase 1 amendments are intended to allow for-profit public\nsector entities to apply the revised Conceptual Framework and continue stating compliance with IFRS\nStandards where they elect to do so.  \nBC50 For these reasons, the Board decided that Phase 1 should also apply to for-profit public sector entities that\nelect to apply the revised Conceptual Framework, in addition to for-profit private sector entities that have\npublic accountability and are required by legislation to comply with Australian Accounting Standards.  \nBC51 The Board decided that it would pursue financial reporting reform in the public sector via consultation\nbased on the AASB Discussion Paper Improving Financial Reporting for Australian Public Sector, which\nwas issued in June 2018.",

        "page_content=": "## Introduction  \nBC1 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board\u2019s considerations in\nreaching the conclusions in AASB 2020-2. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard,\nthe approach taken to developing the Standard, and the bases for key decisions made. In making decisions,\nindividual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.  \nBC2 For more than a decade the Board has been undertaking work aimed at addressing the problems that arise\nfrom entities being allowed to self-assess whether to prepare special purpose financial statements (SPFS) or\ngeneral purpose financial statements (GPFS) when they are required to comply with Australian Accounting\nStandards (AAS) (see paragraphs BC10-BC13 for details). As is evident from empirical research and\nfeedback from stakeholders (see paragraphs BC18-BC41), there is concern that SPFS lack consistency,\ncomparability transparency and enforceability. The Board\u2019s research has identified that there are users of\nfinancial statements that are publicly lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission\n(ASIC), and the Board has been informed by those users that comparability, transparency,\ncomprehensibility and consistency are what is most important to them when reading financial statements.\nFor example comparability of recognition and measurement (R&M) requirements in AAS was rated 88% in\nimportance to primary users[1] and 100% in importance to other users. They also expressed concern that key\ninformation is omitted from SPFSs (see paragraphs BC37-BC41).  \nBC3 Regulatory scrutiny of SPFS has also increased, for example in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on\nCorporations and Financial Services inquiry into the regulation of auditing, the Senate Economics\nReferences Committee Report on Tax Avoidance, and the requirement for all Significant Global Entities\n(SGEs) to lodge GPFS with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (see paragraph BC32(a)).  \nBC4 Within the context of the AASB\u2019s International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards) adoption\npolicy, the issue of a revised _Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (March 2018) (referred to_\nthroughout this Basis for Conclusions as \u2018the RCF\u2019) by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(IASB) provides a timely opportunity to once again consider how best to improve the quality of financial\nreporting in Australia by solving the so-called \u2018SPFS problem\u2019 via a broader project aimed at removing the\nability of certain for-profit private sector entities to prepare SPFS when they are required to prepare\nfinancial statements that comply with AAS.[2] The Board is progressing with this project by considering each\nsector separately, in the first instance for-profit private sector entities required to comply with AAS (being\nthe subject of this Standard \u2013 as explained in paragraphs BC68-BC93).  \nBC5 The Board noted the Australian Government Treasury change in thresholds for large proprietary companies\nwhich defined the entities that are required to lodge their financial statements with ASIC (unless exempted\nby ASIC) in April 2019. Treasury doubled the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large\nproprietary company. As set out in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the increase, the revised\nthresholds were set with the expectation of capturing entities with economic significance and noted the\nlarger the entity, the more likely it is that there are GPFS users. These are key criteria in the AASB\u2019s\nStatement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity for determining whether or not\nan entity is a reporting entity.  \nBC6 As noted in paragraph BC4, the solution to the SPFS problem provided by this Standard is to remove the\nability of certain for-profit private sector entities to self-assess their financial reporting requirements and\nprepare SPFS when they are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS.[3] This will  \n1 AASB Staff Paper _Enhancing the revised_ Conceptual Framework and replacing Special Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 For-profit\n_User and Preparer Survey Results (December 2018). \u2018Primary users\u2019 refers to users that meet the definition of primary users in AASB_\nPractice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements (ie investors (and analysts), lenders and other creditors) and all other respondents\nare referred to as \u2018other users\u2019.  \n2 In this Basis for Conclusions, the reference to AAS in this phrase also includes accounting standards as referred to in legislation (this  \nmeans legislation of a government in Australia).  \n3 The Australian concept of the reporting entity would be retained for entities outside the scope of this Standard (and AASB 2019-1  \n_Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 References to the Conceptual Framework). The Board will consider the financial_\nreporting framework for these entities in the future.  \n-----  improve the consistency, comparability, transparency and enforceability of financial statements, thus\nmeeting the needs of users who are accessing these financial statements on a public register or otherwise.\nThe Board acknowledged that these changes could not be implemented in isolation, as merely removing the\nability of certain for-profit private sector entities to prepare SPFS with no other mitigating action would\nresult in increased reporting requirements for some entities if they were required to transition from SPFS to\nsome form of Tier 2[4] GPFS framework. Therefore, this Standard is made in conjunction with AASB 1060\n_General Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2_\n_Entities (March 2020), which provides simplified Tier 2 GPFS reporting requirements for those for-profit_\nentities that are prohibited from preparing SPFS as a result of this Standard.  \nBC7 The Board also decided to provide transitional relief in addition to that which is currently available via\nAASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards and AASB 1053 (see paragraphs BC122BC135), for entities that choose to early adopt the requirements in this Standard.  \nBC8 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions provides further background and explanation about the reasons\nfor developing this Standard, including:  \n(a) previous Board decisions in relation to earlier stages of the process (to provide a historical\nperspective, see for example paragraphs BC10-BC13);  \n(b) the basis for the key decisions made, including:  \n(i) the types of entities affected by the Standard and the technical requirements (including,\nfor context, a summary of the basis for the revised Tier 2 GPFS framework (see\nparagraphs BC95-BC121), which is detailed in AASB 1060);  \n(ii) transitional provisions (see paragraphs BC122-BC135); and  \n(iii) the effective date (see paragraphs BC145-BC150);  \n(c) how the Board applied _The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework when_\ndeveloping this Standard (see paragraphs BC154-BC156); and  \n(d) the amendments necessary to implement the requirements outlined in this Standard (see\nparagraphs BC157-BC162.",

Indeed, the  \n4 Currently, Australian Accounting Standards consist of two Tiers of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial  \nstatements:\n(a) Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and\n(b) Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements.\n(See paragraph 7 of AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards.) However, the Board is considering what the\nmost appropriate Tier 2 GPFS framework may be \u2013 see paragraph BC95.  \n-----  Board has previously publicly contemplated the removal of the ability of certain entities to self-assess and\nprepare SPFS when required to comply with AAS. For example:  \n(a) AASB Invitation to Comment ITC 12 Request for Comment on a Proposed Revised Differential\n_Reporting Regime for Australia and IASB Exposure Draft of A Proposed IFRS for Small and_\n_Medium-sized Entities (May 2007) noted the concept of SPFS might have been misunderstood in_\nsome cases. To remove the ambiguity concerning the reporting entity concept, ITC 12 sought\ncomment on whether all financial statements available on a public register should be required to\nbe GPFS; and  \n(b) AASB Consultation Paper (CP) _Differential Financial Reporting \u2013 Reducing Disclosure_\n_Requirements_ (February 2010) and ED 192 _Revised Differential Reporting Framework_\n(February 2010), issued in tandem, followed ITC 12 and reaffirmed the Board\u2019s view that the\nreporting entity concept which allows the public lodgement of SPFS should be removed. The\nBoard elaborated on the issues surrounding SPFS in the CP, including noting that:  \n(i) entities are asserted to be \u2018abusing\u2019 the reporting entity concept by claiming to be nonreporting entities and preparing SPFS when they should be preparing GPFS. An\nimpetus for this is the desire to avoid the cost and exposure that would come from\napplying full IFRS Standards as adopted in Australia;  \n(ii) many of the regulators requiring the preparation and lodgement of financial statements\nmay not have given sufficient consideration to the nature of the information they\nrequire and the needs of any external users of that information; and  \n(iii) preparation of SPFS by entities that are required by law to prepare financial statements\nin accordance with accounting standards and be lodged on a public register contradicts\nthe legislation\u2019s objective of providing information to a wide range of users who are\nnot in a position to command specific information to satisfy their needs.  \nBC11 However, the Board noted mixed feedback from constituents in response to these due process documents in\nregard to removing the ability of certain entities to self-assess and prepare SPFS when required to comply\nwith AAS, which suggested that (as noted in paragraphs BC10-BC17 of the Basis for Conclusions to\nAASB 1053):  \n(a) on the one hand, the reporting entity concept involves a high degree of subjectivity, is not\nuniversally understood and hence does not provide the intended result, nor does it provide a\nrobust criterion for differential reporting purposes; and  \n(b) on the other hand, the reporting entity concept works well, and there appeared to be no evidence\nto the contrary, particularly from users.  \nBC12 Consequently, in 2010, the Board decided to issue AASB 1053 and introduce a second tier of GPFS\nreporting, being Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR), but\ndelay the phase of the project addressing the reporting entity concept and the removal of SPFS until further\nresearch had been undertaken. That research would consider in more detail the impact of removing the\nability of certain entities to self-assess and prepare SPFS when required to comply with AAS. The RDR\nrequirements were designed to substantially reduce the disclosure burden when compared to the full\ndisclosure requirements of AAS.  \nBC13 Prompted by the views noted in paragraphs BC10-BC11, the Board initiated research projects, the findings\nof which are discussed in paragraphs BC18-BC25.",

        "page_content=": "## The issues with SPFS  \nBC14 Australia is the only jurisdiction with a reporting entity concept that effectively permits entities to selfassess what type of financial reporting they do, when they are required by legislation or otherwise (such as\nby a constituting document) to prepare financial statements in accordance with AAS. [5] Therefore, unlike\nother jurisdictions, in Australia two similar entities might prepare very different sets of financial statements,\none preparing GPFS using a robust and consistent framework, and the other preparing SPFS with selfselected requirements. This reduces comparability for entities of similar economic circumstances and\nundermines the fundamental principles of trust and transparency.  \n5 See AASB Research Report No. 7 Financial Reporting Requirements Applicable to For-Profit Private Sector Companies (May 2018)  \nfor a comparison of international financial reporting frameworks.  \n-----  BC15 An analysis of the reporting practices of specified for-profit entities lodging financial statements with ASIC\nestimated that 71% of those entities prepared and publicly lodged SPFS in 2018.[ 6] This same research\nestimated that 24% of these entities lodging SPFS either did not comply with the R&M requirements in\nAAS or did not make clear whether they did (refer to paragraphs BC20-BC22). Therefore, only 76% of the\nSPFS voluntarily complied with ASIC Regulatory Guide 85 _Reporting requirements for non-reporting_\n_entities_ (RG 85) recommended guidance to apply all the R&M requirements in AAS (refer BC28-BC29).\nThis suggested a strong need to improve the consistency, comparability, transparency and enforceability of\nfinancial reporting, which would also increase the usefulness and credibility of financial reporting in\nAustralia.  \nBC16 It is incumbent on the AASB to resolve the SPFS problem as, legislatively, the AASB must ensure there are\nappropriate accounting standards for each type of entity that must comply with accounting standards\n(Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act _2001 s229(2)(c)) and facilitate comparability_\n(s224). The ability to make the self-assessment that gives rise to the SPFS problem sits within AAS. Prior to\nissuing this Standard, the only AAS that explicitly apply to SPFS of for-profit private sector entities\nfocussed on presentation and disclosure (and not R&M). As such, it was the directors\u2019 choice of accounting\npolicies that provides the financial reporting framework. As a consequence, other regulators have attempted\nto fill the gap by providing additional guidance in relation to R&M. Despite this, discussions with users,\nincluding lenders and insolvency practitioners, indicated their needs for information about liquidity,\nsolvency, cash flows, commitments and contingencies and related party disclosures were not being met in\nmost SPFS and they were not all aware of the extent of the R&M issues. This indicated a need for minimum\nR&M requirements to be specified in AAS.  \nBC17 Therefore, as noted in paragraph BC6, the Board decided to play its role in improving the consistency,\ncomparability, transparency and enforceability of financial statements to meet user needs, whilst mitigating,\nwhere appropriate, the increased reporting burden for entities that would no longer be able to prepare SPFS\nand would instead be required to prepare GPFS in accordance with AAS.",

        "page_content=": "## Results of research into the reporting practices of specified for- profit entities lodging financial statements with ASIC  \nBC18 The Board initiated academic research that resulted in the publication of AASB Research Report No. 1\n_Application of the Reporting Entity Concept and Lodgement of Special Purpose Financial Statements_\n(June 2014). Research Report No. 1 analysed the application of the reporting entity concept and the\nadoption of special purpose financial reporting, particularly by entities lodging financial statements with\nASIC and with state-based regulators of Australia\u2019s three most populous states, namely, Consumer Affairs\nVictoria, NSW Fair Trading and Queensland Office of Fair Trading. Research Report No. 1 showed that,\nbased on lodgements as at 30 July 2011, approximately 66% of specified for-profit entities[7] lodged SPFS\nwith ASIC. The findings of Research Report No. 1 indicated to the Board that:  \n(a) in light of the high incidence of SPFS being lodged with ASIC, there is doubt as to whether the\nreporting entity concept is being applied as intended by SAC 1;  \n(b) the reporting entity concept appears too subjective for regulators to enforce effectively and\naccordingly does not create a level playing field; and  \n(c) 63% of SPFS lodged with ASIC stated compliance with the R&M requirements of applicable\nAAS, suggesting that R&M was not always complied with despite regulatory guidance\nsuggesting this should be the case (see paragraphs BC28-BC29).  \nBC19 The Board also initiated subsequent research[8] to understand how the reporting practices of for-profit entities\nlodging SPFS with ASIC may have changed since the introduction of the RDR reporting framework in\n2010. An analysis of financial reports of the specified for-profit entities lodging financial statements with\nASIC in 2018 confirmed that 71% of these entities were still lodging SPFS with ASIC, 13% lodged Tier 2\nGPFS and 16% lodged Tier 1 GPFS. The Board also noted that those entities preparing Tier 2 GPFS (RDR)\nappear to have moved from Tier 1 GPFS to RDR and not from SPFS to RDR.  \n6 AASB Research Report 12 Financial Reporting Practices of For-Profit Entities Lodging Special Purpose Financial Statements (August  \n2019). Research Report 12 examines the financial reporting practices of for-profit entities, including large proprietary companies, small\nforeign-controlled proprietary companies, for-profit unlisted public companies and other small proprietary companies, lodging financial\nstatements with ASIC. The findings of Research Report 12 considered in this Standard are limited to those that relate to entities within\nthe scope of the proposals in this Standard, that is large proprietary companies, small foreign-controlled proprietary companies and forprofit unlisted public companies limited by guarantee. These entities are referred to herein as the \u2018specified for-profit entities\u2019.  \n7 Specified for-profit entities are large proprietary companies, small foreign-controlled companies and unlisted public companies.\n8 Research Report No 12  \n-----  BC20 In respect of compliance with the R&M requirements in AAS, the Board noted the more detailed findings of\nResearch Report 12, which estimates that 76% of specified for-profit entities preparing and lodging SPFS\nwith ASIC complied with the R&M requirements in AAS. In particular:  \n(a) 66% explicitly stated that they followed the R&M requirements in AAS (compared with the 63%\nfound in Research Report No.1 \u2013 see paragraph BC18(c)); and  \n(b) 10% were assessed to have complied with the R&M requirements in AAS based on a qualitative\nreview of the accounting policies, despite the absence of an explicit statement to that effect.  \nBC21 For the remaining 24%:  \n(a) 10% did not comply with the R&M requirements in AAS (of which only 0.5% clearly stated so);\nand  \n(b) the extent of compliance (or otherwise) with the R&M requirements in AAS of the remaining\n14% was unclear.  \nBC22 In addition to it being difficult for the researchers to understand the extent of alignment between an entity\u2019s\naccounting policies and the R&M requirements in AAS, the Board noted the same difficulties faced by\nfinancial statement users. This leads to fundamental issues with the transparency of information available to\nusers of publicly lodged SPFS, consistency and the comparability of SPFS with other SPFS and GPFS. As\nnoted in paragraph BC15, only 76% of entities preparing SPFS are voluntarily complying with RG 85\nrecommendations, suggesting that mandatory requirements were needed to improve the quality of financial\nreporting.  \nBC23 In response, in July 2019, the Board issued ED 293 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013_\n_Disclosure in Special Purpose Financial Statements of Compliance with Recognition and Measurement_\n_Requirements_ which proposed, as an interim measure, amendments to AAS to require entities preparing\nSPFS to make an explicit statement as to whether or not the accounting policies applied in the SPFS comply\nwith all the R&M requirements in AAS. The Board acknowledged that disclosure of this information was\nnot sufficient to address the problems with publicly lodged SPFS, however the interim measure was aimed\nat providing some measure of transparency to users until the resolution of the SPFS problem, in the short to\nmedium term for for-profit private sector entities and in the longer term for not-for-profit entities. After\nconsidering feedback from respondents on ED 293, the Board decided to limit the scope of the proposals to\nonly not-for-profit (NFP) entities as respondents \u201cwere particularly concerned about the costs of the ED 293\nproposals exceeding any benefits for for-profit private sector entities given the ED 293 proposals were\nintended to be only a short-term measure for these entities. This is because the broader project proposing to\nremove the ability for certain for-profit private sector entities to prepare special purpose financial statements\nwhen they are required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards is expected to be completed by\n30 June 2020.\u201d[9 ]  \nBC24 In light of the effective date of this Standard being one year later than that proposed in ED 297, and also\nnoting that there is likely to be a number of entities that will continue to be able to prepare SPFS (e.g. due to\nthe exemption provided to entities with a non-legislative requirement to prepare financial statements that\ncomply with AAS (refer paragraphs BC90-BC92)), the Board reconsidered this decision. The Board was\nconcerned about the lack of transparency in the SPFS that continues to refer to AAS and therefore decided\nthat these entities should also be required to disclose a statement of the entity\u2019s compliance, or otherwise,\nwith the R&M requirements in AAS (including requirements set out in AASB 10 _Consolidated Financial_\n_Statements or AASB 128_ _Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures). The Board thought this was_\nparticularly important for securitisation trusts given they are listed on the ASX and other securities\nexchanges. The Board intends to communicate with the ASX and industry bodies to ensure they understand\nthe implications of having SPFS on their public registers.  \nBC25 In addition to the research described above, the Board also conducted significant targeted outreach prior to\nissuing the standard, where over 250 formal meetings were held with key stakeholders, including State,\nTerritory and Commonwealth regulators, audit offices, large and small accounting firms, the Australian\nSecurities Exchange (ASX), ASIC, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC),\ncredit rating agencies, professional bodies and users of financial statements (including analysts, investors\nand creditors) to help identify how implementing the RCF and removing the ability of certain for-profit\nprivate sector entities to prepare SPFS when they are required to prepare financial statements that comply\nwith AAS, would impact Australian entities. The Board considered the feedback received, when developing\nthe Standard.  \n9 AASB 2019-4, paragraph BC43 and BC 44. At the time of making that decision, the effective date of this Standard was proposed as  \n1 July 2020.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Regulatory views and developments on SPFS  \nBC26 The Board noted feedback from some stakeholders suggesting that it was the role of other regulators (rather\nthan the AASB) to address any potential issues with SPFS. In particular, some stakeholders argued:  \n(a) other regulators should specify or determine whether an entity is required to lodge GPFS; [10] and  \n(b) if the reporting entity concept is not being applied correctly, this is a matter of enforcement for\nthe appropriate regulator rather than a matter of standard-setting.  \nBC27 Thus, the Board has paid particular regard to the views of other regulators, and noted the increasing\nregulatory interest in and concern about the use of SPFS to assess what role the Board should play in\naddressing the issues.  \nBC28 The Board noted ASIC issued RG 85 in July 2005, which states \u201cASIC believes that non-reporting entities,\nwhich are required to prepare financial reports in accordance with Chapter 2M of the _Corporations Act_\n_2001 (Act), should comply with the recognition and measurement requirements of accounting standards\u201d[11]_\n\u201chence, the recognition and measurement requirements of accounting standards must also be applied in\norder to determine the financial position and profit or loss of any entity preparing financial reports in\naccordance with the Act\u201d.[12]  \nBC29 RG 85 further states that \u201cDirectors of non-reporting entities must also consider carefully the need to make\ndisclosures which are not directly prescribed by accounting standards, but which may be necessary in order\nfor the financial statements to give a true and fair view\u201d,[13] and that those standards that must be applied by\nentities reporting under the _Corporations Act 2001 are AASB 101_ _Presentation of Financial Statements,_\nAASB 107 _Statement of Cash Flows, AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates_\n_and Errors, AASB 1048_ _Interpretation of Standards and AASB 1054_ _Australian Additional Disclosures._\nHowever, as noted in paragraph BC21, research into the extent of compliance with the R&M requirements\nin AAS by specified for-profit entities lodging SPFS with ASIC shows that at least 10% and potentially up\nto 24% of them do not appear to have followed the guidance outlined in RG 85. ASIC has also indicated it\nfinds the judgements required regarding the application of the reporting entity concept in SAC 1 to be\nunenforceable.  \nBC30 The appropriateness of SPFS have also been called into question in a number of other regulatory matters.\nFor example, as part of the Senate Economics References Committee Report on Tax Avoidance, the\nBoard\u2019s Chair was asked to explain to the Committee the reporting entity concept and its role in facilitating\nthe preparation of SPFS. The Board noted the subsequent Report, _Corporate tax avoidance Part III, Much_\n_heat, little light so far_ (May 2018), outlined strong concern that multinationals operating within Australia\nare avoiding public scrutiny through the preparation of SPFS, which are not required to disclose corporate\ntax and related party transactions, and also noted the Board\u2019s role in facilitating the public lodgement of\nSPFS through its reporting entity concept. The Report recommended the Government require all companies,\ntrusts and other financial entities with income above a certain amount to lodge GPFS with ASIC. These\ncomments, albeit with a focus on tax, reinforce the view that a problem exists in relation to the way in\nwhich the reporting entity concept is applied, as well as the information provided through the public\nlodgement of SPFS.  \nBC31 The Board also reflected on the recommendations in the _Final Report of the Royal Commission into_\n_Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (February 2019), particularly_\nthe recommendation to remove special rules and exceptions that can create regulatory complexities. The\nFinal Report indicated that exceptions departing from underlying principles have consequences often\nresulting in exploitation and that exceptions act as barriers to the simplification of regulation. The Board\nfurther considered the theme of enforceability within the Final Report, noting in particular that the\nsubjectivity inherent in the current Australian reporting entity concept may not provide regulators with an\nobjective basis on which to enforce financial reporting obligations.  \nBC32 In addition, other regulatory developments indicated an increased need for entities to prepare GPFS instead\nof SPFS where they are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS, for example:  \n(a) the requirement for SGEs[14] to lodge GPFS with the ATO, which would subsequently be provided\nto ASIC[15] (December 2015);  \n10 This is consistent with the view that the AASB\u2019s role and expertise is to determine the appropriate accounting framework and  \naccounting standards that should apply where legislation, regulation or other authority requires the preparation of financial statements\nthat comply with AAS.  \n11 Paragraph 2 of RG 85.\n12 Paragraph 2.5 of RG 85.\n13 Paragraph 2.9 of RG 85.\n14 An entity is an SGE for a period if it is one of the following (as defined in Subdivision 960-U of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997):  \n(a) a \u2018global parent entity\u2019 whose \u2018annual global income\u2019 is A$1 billion or more; or  \n-----  (b) questions to the Board\u2019s Chair and the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s (FRC) Chair on the\nAASB\u2019s and FRC\u2019s approaches to resolving the shortcomings of SPFS by the Parliamentary Joint\nCommittee on Corporations and Financial Services as part of its inquiry into the oversight of\nASIC and the Takeovers Panel (February 2018);  \n(c) the Senate Economics References Committee report _Financial and tax practices of for-profit_\n_aged care providers (November 2018), which supported the Board\u2019s intent to remove the ability_\nof certain entities to prepare SPFS where they are required to prepare financial statements that\ncomply with AAS; and  \n(d) further questions to the Board\u2019s Chair on the status of the AASB\u2019s work to remove SPFS from\nthe Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services as part of its inquiry\ninto the regulation of auditing in Australia (November 2019). SPFS were criticised both by\nmembers of that committee as well as in several submissions from the public in relation to that\ninquiry.  \nBC33 In light of the regulatory developments and public enquiries noted above, the Board also observed the\nincreasing public interest and media scrutiny of the transparency and accountability of publicly available\nfinancial statements, both generally and specifically in relation to the reporting entity concept and its\nfacilitation of publicly lodged SPFS.  \nBC34 In proposing to remove the ability of certain for-profit private sector entities to prepare SPFS when they are\nrequired to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS, the Board received support from other\nregulators, particularly ASIC and the ATO, which conveyed the following views to the Board:  \n(a) ASIC fully supports the consultation to remove SPFS for entities regulated by ASIC and remove\nthe subjective \u2018reporting entity\u2019 test under SAC 1, facilitating a comparable, consistent and\ntransparent framework for the preparation of financial statements in Australia; and  \n(b) the ATO is supportive of the AASB\u2019s proposed approach to consulting on a series of principles or\nconcepts for enhancing the transparency of entities currently preparing SPFS as part of adopting\nthe RCF issued by the IASB and for inclusion in AAS by 2021. The ATO also noted its further\nsupport of the AASB\u2019s recommendations surrounding the timing and application of the new Tier\n2 disclosures requirements during the Board\u2019s Exposure Draft process.  \nBC35 The Board provided input to Treasury in considering legislative requirements that specify which types of\nfor-profit entities should be required to prepare and, in most cases, publicly lodge financial statements with\nASIC. In April 2019, Treasury announced changes to the _Corporations Regulations_ _2001[16] to increase_\n(double) the thresholds used for determining whether an entity is a large proprietary company, with\ncompanies falling below the thresholds not being required to prepare or publicly lodge financial reports\nwith ASIC. As part of the changes, the Board suggested Treasury provide objective criteria based on\neconomic significance for determining the thresholds and noted the commentary in Treasury\u2019s Explanatory\nStatement, which is consistent with the Board\u2019s decision to remove the ability of certain entities to prepare\nSPFS when they are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS. In particular, the Board\nnoted:  \n(a) the requirement for large proprietary companies to prepare and in some cases lodge financial\nreports was first introduced to focus regulation of reporting on the financial affairs of proprietary\ncompanies that have a significant economic influence; and  \n(b) the financial reports of companies that have economic significance should be publicly available\nbecause of their size and potential to affect the community and the economy. The larger the size,\nthe more likely it is that there will exist users dependent on GPFS as a basis for making economic\ndecisions.  \nBC36 This clearly indicates the new thresholds which apply from 1 July 2019 were set to reflect the \u2018economic\nsignificance\u2019 of the entities captured, which is another key criterion in SAC 1 for deciding whether or not an\nentity is a reporting entity.",

In considering submissions\nreceived on ITC 39 the Board noted that of the 33 formal respondents (relevant to this phase of the project),  \n(b) a member of a group of entities consolidated (for accounting purposes) where the global parent entity has an annual global income  \nof A$1 billion or more.  \n15 Introduced by Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Act 2015.\n16 Introduced by Corporations Amendment (Proprietary Company Thresholds) Regulations 2019.  \n-----  85% agreed there is a problem with SPFS that needs to be solved, with similar feedback received\nanecdotally through other outreach activities.  \nBC38 As part of the due process, a significant amount of feedback was provided by users of financial statements.\nOf particular importance is the AASB Staff Paper _Enhancing the revised_ Conceptual Framework and\n_replacing Special Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 For-profit User and Preparer Survey Results_\n(December 2018), which indicated that, from the perspective of the 37 users (analysts, investors and\ncreditors) that responded:  \n(a) there is a problem with SPFS that needs to be addressed \u2013 78% of primary users expressed\nconcern that SPFS do not consistently apply R&M requirements in AAS;  \n(b) 93% of primary users and over 95% of other users said that comparability, transparency,\ncomprehensibility and consistency are all paramount; and  \n(c) there is dissatisfaction with SPFS that needs to be addressed, particularly around the lack of\nrelated party disclosures, lack of comparability and that the extent to which entities comply with\nthe R&M requirements in AAS is unclear to users.  \nBC39 The Board also conducted a range of meetings with users to understand their needs and received six formal\nsubmissions on ITC 39 from users of financial statements (out of the 33 responses relevant to this phase of\nthe project). In those formal submissions, the Board noted that all of those respondents:  \n(a) noted, or referred to, the lack of comparability, consistency and transparency currently caused by\nSPFS that needs to be resolved; and  \n(b) supported public lodgement of financial statements that comply with all of the R&M\nrequirements in AAS. Consistency, transparency and comparability were noted as important to\nusers in their responses, with one user also noting the importance of consistent financial reporting\nto facilitate computer-based analysis and use of financial information.  \nBC40 In addition to the information in paragraph BC38, the Board also noted other evidence that clearly indicates\nthe existence of users who would benefit from having access to GPFS rather than SPFS. For example:  \n(a) over 98,000 copies of financial statements were purchased during the year ending 30 June 2018\nfrom ASIC. Of those financial statements purchased, 80% were of proprietary companies, 16%\nwere of unlisted public companies and 4% were of small foreign-controlled companies;[17]  \n(b) anecdotally, data aggregators[18] rely on publicly available information to assist their clients with\ndetermining the viability, capacity and credit risk associated with a company; and  \n(c) as noted in paragraph BC35, Treasury indicated in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the\nrevision of the large proprietary company thresholds its expectation that there are users dependent\non the GPFS of large proprietary companies, given their economic significance. Further, that\nExplanatory Statement noted that average access rates through ASIC of the revised (smaller)\npopulation of large proprietary companies was significantly higher (on average 3.6 times per\ncompany) than the proprietary companies that would no longer have an obligation to prepare and\nlodge financial statements with ASIC (on average 1.8 times per company).  \nBC41 Despite the relatively lower access rates for small foreign-controlled companies and unlisted public\ncompanies noted in paragraph BC40(a), the Board noted its expectation that users of those financial\nstatements would also benefit from having access to GPFS rather than SPFS given that:  \n(a) small foreign-controlled companies have been specifically required to lodge financial statements\nwith ASIC[19], and are already provided with significant relief from financial reporting obligations\nif the company is included in the consolidated financial statements of a registered foreign\ncompany that is lodged with ASIC. Additionally, _ASIC Corporations (Foreign-Controlled_\n_Company Reports) Instrument 2017/204 provides further relief to small foreign-controlled_  \n17 Of these 98,000 copies of financial statements, approximately 29,000 were purchased by public users through ASIC connect and not by  \ndata aggregators.  \n18 Data aggregators purchase and analyse data for the purpose of providing informed credit and risk management advice, industry profiling  \nand other analytic products and services.  \n19 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Company Law Review Bill 1997 noted that \u201cfinancial reporting by small proprietary companies  \nwhich are foreign-controlled should, as far as possible, equate with the reporting requirements of small proprietary companies which are\ncontrolled by Australian companies. Accordingly, a small proprietary company will be required to prepare a financial report if the\ncontrolling registered foreign company does not prepare and lodge financial statements with the ASC which consolidate the affairs of\nthe small proprietary company for the period in which it was controlled. \u2026 An Australian company which controls a small proprietary\ncompany is required to consolidate the small proprietary company in its consolidated financial report if it comes within the scope of\n_AASB 1024: Consolidated Accounts. While it would not be appropriate for the Corporations Law to generally require a registered_\nforeign company to prepare consolidated financial statements, that company may consolidate the small proprietary company in financial\nstatements prepared under the law of its jurisdiction of incorporation. If consolidated accounts of this kind are lodged with the ASC in\naccordance with the requirements in current section 349, the remainder of Chapter 2M will not apply to the small proprietary company.\u201d  \n-----  entities \u2013 even if they are not consolidated by a registered foreign company lodging financial\nstatements with ASIC \u2013 by requiring them to lodge financial statements with ASIC only if\ndirected to do so by shareholders or ASIC, or if they are part of a large group in Australia. The\nrequirement for small foreign-controlled companies to lodge financial statements where they are\npart of a large group is designed to prevent foreign-controlled companies disaggregating their\nAustralian activities into smaller companies to avoid financial reporting obligations.[20] In light of\nthis Australian public interest context, demonstrated also through the requirements for SGEs to\nlodge GPFS with the ATO and the strong public interest in seeing no avoidance of tax, there\nappears to be no justification for small foreign-controlled companies to be relieved from the\nrequirement to prepare GPFS; and  \n(b) unlisted public companies by definition would have at least 50 non-employee shareholders (ie\nexternal users) and have the ability to offer shares to the public. As such, the Board noted it\nwould be difficult to justify there being no external users of such entities\u2019 financial statements \u2013\nand therefore GPFS are warranted. In addition, it is possible that some of the 3,102 unlisted\npublic companies[21] currently lodging financial statements with ASIC may be not-for-profit\nentities, and as such would not be affected by this Standard.",

        "page_content=": "## The RCF  \nBC42 The IASB issued the RCF in March 2018. The RCF describes the objective and concepts for general\npurpose financial reporting under IFRS Standards. Its purpose is to assist standard-setters to develop\nStandards that are based on consistent concepts, and to help preparers develop consistent accounting\npolicies when no Standard applies to a particular transaction or event, or when a Standard allows a choice of\naccounting policy.[22] It also assists anyone looking to understand and interpret the Standards. However, the\nRCF\u2019s concept of \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is different from the reporting entity concept in SAC 1 and some\nAAS.[23]  \nBC43 Making the IASB\u2019s RCF applicable in Australia, modified where necessary for public sector and NFP\nspecific issues, is consistent with the FRC\u2019s strategic direction to the Board and the Board\u2019s strategic\nobjectives. In accordance with those strategies, the Board should:  \n(a) maintain compliance with IFRS Standards for publicly accountable entities; and  \n(b) use IFRS Standards as a base for determining the reporting requirements for all other entities,\nmodified as appropriate, in accordance with _The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting_\n_Framework and The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework._  \nBC44 However, if the AASB\u2019s current reporting entity concept were maintained at the same time the RCF is\napplied, the inconsistency of the Australian reporting entity concept with the RCF could result in confusion,\nmisinterpretation and the incorrect application of AAS and non-compliance with IFRS Standards. The\nlikelihood of inconsistencies would also increase as and when IFRS Standards are amended or revised and\nmore references to the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 as defined in the RCF are included in IFRS Standards.  \nBC45 Implementation of the RCF in Australia is challenging due to the reporting entity concept clash, that is, the\nreporting entity concept in the RCF determines the boundary of what needs to be reported when an entity is\nrequired to report, eg consolidation, and it does not determine who should prepare GPFS, as it is assumed\nthat legislation requiring the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards is\nrequiring GPFS. In contrast, the current Australian reporting entity concept allows entities to self-assess\nwhether they should prepare:  \n(a) GPFS, which requires compliance with all AAS, including recognition, measurement,\npresentation and disclosure requirements; or  \n(b) SPFS, which only requires compliance with a small number of AAS that are more focussed on\nthe presentation of and disclosure in financial statements and don\u2019t specify R&M requirements.  \nThe ability of entities to self-assess their reporting requirements under the Australian reporting entity\nconcept has led to the more fundamental \u2018SPFS problem\u2019.  \nBC46 Further, the SAC 1 reporting entity concept has led to confusion and diversity in practice regarding whether\nconsolidation and equity accounting should be applied in SPFS publicly lodged with ASIC. RG 85 notes\nthat some \u201ccompanies have failed to prepare consolidated financial statements on the grounds that the  \n20 See the Explanatory Statement to ASIC Corporations (Foreign-Controlled Company Reports) Instrument 2017/204.\n21 Research Report 12\n22 The RCF, paragraph SP1.1.\n23 The term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 as defined by the RCF is also inconsistent with the definition of reporting entity in AASB 1057 Application  \n_of Australian Accounting Standards._  \n-----  parent entity was not a reporting entity\u201d[24] and that the \u201csole determining factor as to whether consolidated\nfinancial statements are required is whether the group is a reporting entity\u201d (emphasis added).[25] The RCF\nand AASB 10 however, require consolidation if an entity is a parent, with limited exceptions.[26]  \nBC47 This reporting entity clash was addressed in ITC 39, and ITC 39 sought comment on the clash between the\nreporting entity concepts in the RCF and SAC 1 and the related SPFS problem. The requirements of this\nStandard have been informed by the Board\u2019s research and consultation undertaken prior to and since ITC 39\nwas issued. The results of that research and consultation, and how it influenced the Board\u2019s decisions, are\noutlined throughout this Basis for Conclusions.  \nBC48 To address the reporting entity clash, ITC 39 considered a number of options to apply the RCF (refer to\nparagraphs BC52-BC57), including considering whether it would be feasible to operate with two conceptual\nframeworks[27] \u2013 the RCF for publicly accountable entities and entities that wish to claim IFRS compliance,\nand the current _Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements_ (existing\nConceptual Framework) for other entities (which would include maintaining SAC 1, the Australian\nreporting entity concept and SPFS for all entities not applying the RCF). However, the Board decided that\nthis option was not feasible, as new and revised AAS will be based on the RCF, which includes revised\ndefinitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities, a new chapter on the reporting entity and a new\nchapter on measurement. Therefore, if entities continued to apply the existing Conceptual Framework when\ndeveloping accounting policies or interpreting AAS, they are likely to develop inappropriate accounting\npolicies or incorrectly interpret AAS. This could result in inaccurate and inconsistent financial reporting\nwhich would reduce the transparency and comparability for users of financial statements.  \nBC49 Updating the existing Conceptual Framework for the changes made via the RCF other than the reporting\nentity concept was also not feasible given the pervasive use of \u2018reporting entity\u2019 throughout the RCF. The\nBoard also considered an option to simply rename the reporting entity concept in SAC 1 to resolve the\nreporting entity clash.[28] The Board however decided that this approach would not meet any of the justifiable\ncircumstances set out in The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework for the AASB to have\ndifferent requirements to IFRS Standards. Further, this would be inconsistent with the AASB\u2019s legislative\nrequirements to ensure there are appropriate accounting standards for each type of entity that must comply\nwith accounting standards and to facilitate consistency, comparability, transparency and enforceability\n(refer paragraph BC16). This is because such an approach would not resolve the fundamental issues with\nthe public lodgement of SPFS, which is addressed in the next section, or the evident inconsistency in\npractice and lack of transparency.",

This would remove the ability of an entity to self-assess that it is not a \u2018reporting entity\u2019 as\ncurrently defined in SAC 1, and so prevent it from preparing SPFS if it is required to prepare financial\nstatements that comply with AAS.  \nBC51 The Board concluded the removal of the self-assessment of the reporting entity concept and disallowance of\nthe preparation of SPFS for certain for-profit private sector entities would simplify the reporting framework\nby providing a single set of minimum requirements, facilitating the objective of a consistent, comparable,\ntransparent and enforceable Australian financial reporting framework.

In ITC 39 the\nBoard considered five different options for implementing the RCF in Australia and the benefits and barriers  \n24 RG 85, paragraph 5.1.\n25 RG 85, paragraph 5.5.\n26 Paragraphs 4, Aus4.1, Aus4.2 and 4B of AASB 10 outline the exemptions and exceptions whereby a parent entity need not present  \nconsolidated financial statements.  \n27 Refer paragraph BC57(a).\n28 Refer paragraph BC57(d).  \n-----  of each option. After considering the comments from respondents on ITC 39, the Board decided to adopt\nOption 1 in ITC 39, a two-phased approach to applying the RCF:  \n(a) in the short term maintaining compliance with IFRS Standards for publicly accountable for-profit\nprivate sector entities required by legislation to comply with AAS and other for-profit entities\nvoluntarily claiming compliance with IFRS Standards (Phase 1); and  \n(b) in the medium term maintaining IFRS Standards as a base by removing the Australian reporting\nentity concept from AAS and providing a revised Tier 2 GPFS framework (Phase 2). This would\nremove the ability of an entity to prepare SPFS where they are required to prepare financial\nstatements that comply with AAS.  \nBC53 The Board decided in favour of this two-phased approach because it:  \n(a) allowed for-profit private sector entities with public accountability and entities that voluntarily\nreport compliance with IFRS Standards to continue to do so;  \n(b) allowed all other entities to continue preparing SPFS in the short term while the Board undertook\nconsultation and outreach activities and determined the appropriate Tier 2 GPFS framework to\nreplace SPFS;  \n(c) maintained IFRS Standards as a base for all entities in the medium term;  \n(d) solved the reporting entity problem in the medium term;  \n(e) solved the SPFS problem in the medium term;  \n(f) allowed time for the Board to consult and determine any NFP modifications that may be\nnecessary to the RCF in accordance with _The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting_\n_Framework; and_  \n(g) facilitated comparability and ensured there were appropriate accounting standards for each type\nof entity required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS.  \nBC54 Phase 1 implemented the RCF for publicly accountable for-profit private sector entities and other entities\nvoluntarily reporting compliance with IFRS Standards so that they continue to maintain IFRS compliance\nwhen the RCF took effect internationally on 1 January 2020. Entities in Australia with public accountability\nmust apply the full IFRS Standards as AAS incorporate IFRS Standards and therefore, the Board\nreconfirmed its view that for-profit private sector entities in Australia with public accountability should be\nrequired to prepare Tier 1 GPFS. The Board completed Phase 1 in May 2019 (see AASB 2019-1\n_Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 References to the Conceptual Framework)._  \nBC55 ITC 39 proposed that Phase 2 would then implement the RCF for all other entities. However after\nconsidering initial feedback on ITC 39, the results of discussions with ACNC and other State and Territory\nregulators regarding the recommendations in the ACNC\u2019s Legislative Review 2018: _Strengthening for_\n_Purpose: Australian Charities And Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC legislative review), research_\ninitiated by the Board and _The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework, the Board_\ndecided that the proposals in ITC 39 should only apply to for-profit private sector entities, and that it would\nbe more appropriate to progress reform of the NFP public and private sector financial reporting framework\nvia separate targeted consultations undertaken as part of the broader financial reporting framework project\n(refer to paragraphs BC73-BC75 for further discussion). The Board also decided to consider the public\nsector financial reporting framework separately (refer to paragraph BC80).  \nBC56 Option 1 in ITC 39 contemplated that during Phase 2, the Tier 2 GPFS framework in AASB 1053 would be\nrevised to be one of the following alternatives:  \n(a) RDR \u2013 The existing Tier 2 GPFS framework as currently exists in AASB 1053, consisting of full\nR&M, including consolidation and equity accounting (where applicable) with reduced disclosures\nfrom each applicable AAS; or  \n(b) Specified Disclosure Requirements (SDR) \u2013 A new Tier 2 GPFS framework that would consist of\nfull R&M including consolidation and equity accounting (where applicable), however with\nspecified disclosures from only some AAS.  \nThe Board subsequently decided that neither RDR nor SDR were appropriate Tier 2 disclosure frameworks.\nThe Board instead decided to develop another alternative, the _Simplified Disclosures Framework, as_\nenacted by AASB 1060 and explained further in paragraph BC98.",

        "page_content=": "## Other options considered in ITC 39  \nBC57 ITC 39 considered four other options for implementing the RCF in Australia. However, after considering\nconstituent comments, the Board decided not to pursue them, as explained below:  \n-----  (a) Option 2 \u2013 Operate with two conceptual frameworks. This option would implement the RCF for\npublicly accountable for-profit entities and other entities voluntarily reporting compliance with\nIFRS Standards. It would also retain the existing Conceptual Framework for all other entities. The\nBoard decided not to pursue this option as it requires two conceptual frameworks indefinitely,\nwhich would likely lead to the development of inconsistent accounting policies between entities\npreparing financial statements under the existing Conceptual Framework and entities preparing\nfinancial statements under the RCF. Also this option does not solve either the clash of the\nreporting entity concepts or the SPFS problem.  \n(b) Option 3 \u2013 Implement the RCF for all entities when it first becomes applicable to maintain\ncompliance with IFRS Standards and IFRS Standards as a base for Australian Accounting\nStandards. This option would result in a single conceptual framework for all entities in the short\nterm, remove the Australian reporting entity concept and the ability of an entity to prepare SPFS\nas a non-reporting entity when they are required to comply with AAS from 1 January 2020.\nOption 3 would see an increase in regulatory burden, particularly for NFP entities, as there would\nbe a considerable step up for many entities transitioning to Tier 2 GPFS framework given the\nnumber of entities preparing SPFS and the short timeframe for transition to GPFS. The Board was\nconcerned that this option would not provide entities with enough time for transition.  \n(c) Option 4 \u2013 Retain the existing Conceptual Framework, the Australian reporting entity concept\nand the ability of an entity to prepare SPFS as a non-reporting entity where they are required to\ncomply with AAS. Under this option compliance with AAS might not result in compliance with\nIFRS Standards after 1 January 2020.  \n(d) Option 5 \u2013 Implement the RCF from 1 January 2020 when it first becomes applicable to maintain\ncompliance with IFRS Standards and keep IFRS Standards as a base for AAS. Under Option 5,\nthe Australian reporting entity concept would be retained but the name amended and minimum\nrequirements for SPFS would be prescribed by the Board. The Board decided not to proceed with\nOption 5 as it did not consider this option to be significantly different from Option 1 (except for\nthe phased approach) or Option 3, as the AASB would still need to prescribe minimum reporting\nrequirements for SPFS preparers to resolve the SPFS problem.",

The\nBoard considered the comments received from each respondent and engaged directly with respondents to\ndiscuss any comments which required clarification. The Board also received feedback on the phase 2\nproposals (targeted only to for-profit private sector entities) when they were presented at various forums,\nworkshops and discussion groups to obtain feedback. This included roundtable sessions held in September\n2018, where 106 stakeholders including regulators, professional bodies, users, preparers, auditors and\nacademics attended. Furthermore, feedback was sought via targeted user and preparer surveys in quarter 3\nof 2018, which received a total of 37 user and 49 preparer responses. The surveys were focussed on the\nspecific matters for comment in ITC 39, and were used to get a better understanding of which of the Tier 2\nGPFS frameworks proposed in ITC 39 users preferred (and why), as well as what transitional relief would\nbe helpful to preparers. The feedback received from the formal comment letters, roundtables and surveys\nwas consistent, indicating that  \n(a) there is a SPFS problem that needs to be solved;  \n(b) the Tier 2 GPFS framework should require compliance with all the R&M requirements in AAS\nincluding consolidation and equity accounting (where applicable);  \n(c) comparability, transparency, comprehensibility and consistency are what users need most in\nfinancial statements;  \n(d) a revised Tier 2 GPFS disclosure framework was preferred as SDR seemed to be missing some\nkey disclosures, while RDR had too many. The Board noted the low number of entities moving\nfrom SPFS indicated that the costs of RDR were seen to outweigh the benefits for these entities.\nHowever, in comparison to Tier 1 GPFS there was some benefit as 13% had voluntarily moved to\nRDR. Respondents felt that something in between the RDR and SDR framework would better\nsatisfy user needs and suggested a more balanced approach to disclosures was needed;  \n(e) there is widespread uncertainty on whether AASB 1 provides enough transitional relief to\nfacilitate the transition from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS (in whatever form that may take);  \n-----  (f) only one Tier 2 GPFS framework is necessary for for-profit private sector entities, given the\nentities required to prepare and in some cases publicly lodge financial statements is such a small\nproportion of actively trading entities, however some respondents were concerned that the\nproposals were not also considering who should be publicly lodging financial statements, noting\nin particular that the thresholds used from determining what constitutes a large proprietary\ncompany had not been reviewed for a number of years;  \n(g) there were no clear views on what additional transitional relief, is needed;  \n(h) respondents were concerned about the effect of the proposals on entities with a non-legislative\nrequirement to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS (ie entities with trust deeds\nand other constituting documents inadvertently requiring compliance with AAS). Respondents\nwere also concerned about the complexities and the potential costs involved in changing such\ndocuments;  \n(i) a small number of respondents wanted the AASB to further consider the International Financial\n_Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities_ (IFRS for SMEs Standard) as an\noptional Tier 2 GPFS framework alternative or as the Tier 2 GPFS framework;  \n(j) a small number of respondents asked for a financial reporting framework for those entities not\nrequired by legislation to prepare or lodge financial statements; and  \n(k) some respondents thought more evidence of user needs was required.  \nBC59 Subsequent to receiving comments on ITC 39, all formal comment letters were made available to the public\nvia the AASB website.[29] Summaries of feedback obtained from various outreach events, results from user\nand preparer surveys, and agenda papers for AASB Board meetings were also made available via the AASB\nwebsite.  \nBC60 The Board decided to proceed with Phase 2 and resolve the issues with SPFS after considering:  \n(a) the responses from financial statement users, preparers and other stakeholders during the public\nconsultation period, including over 200 targeted discussions;  \n(b) the findings in AASB Research Reports and commissioned academic research;  \n(c) the level of voluntary compliance with ASIC RG 85;  \n(d) the low number of entities moving from SPFS to RDR;  \n(e) the results of user and preparer surveys;  \n(f) the decision by Treasury to revise the large proprietary thresholds (and therefore answering the\n\u2018who\u2019 should report question) (see paragraph BC35); and  \n(g) the views of other regulators noted above, in particular the views expressed by ASIC in RG85\nthat, to provide a true and fair view of a company\u2019s financial position and performance, all of the\nR&M requirements in AAS should be complied with (see paragraphs BC28-BC29).  \nThe accumulated body of evidence indicates there are users of publicly lodged SPFS and there is\nwidespread acknowledgement, particularly from users, that the current financial reporting framework does\nnot provide consistent, comparable, comprehensible, transparent and enforceable financial statements.  \nBC61 As such, the Board developed an Exposure Draft of proposals to address the issues, as set out in the next\nsection.",

For example, for-profit co-operatives and incorporated associations required\nby state or territory legislation to prepare financial statements in accordance with AAS or accounting\nstandards are also subject to this Standard.  \nBC70 Some respondents to ED 297 questioned whether it was appropriate to include entities that are not required\nto publicly lodge financial statements within the scope of the Standard, such as large proprietary companies\nthat are not required to lodge financial reports with ASIC if they meet certain conditions outlined in section\n1408 of the Corporations Act 2001 (exempt proprietary companies). However, the Board decided against\nsuch an exemption on the basis that the relevant legislation requires compliance with accounting standards\nfor a reason, whether or not articulated by the other regulator, regardless of whether the financial statements\nare publicly lodged. The Board also noted a number of these entities would have been required to comply\nwith the SGE legislation and would have benefited from the increase in the large proprietary thresholds, so\nthe impacted number of entities is considerably reduced. Further, the Board preferred to limit any special\nrules or exceptions in the proposals, consistent with recommendations in the _Final Report of the Royal_\n_Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry._  \nBC71 Entities not subject to this Standard (or the requirements in AASB 2019-1) continue to be able to prepare\nSPFS if they classify themselves as non-reporting entities, and where the SPFS are prepared other than in\naccordance with AAS. For these entities, the financial reporting framework applied in the SPFS would\ncontinue to be determined by the accounting policies selected by the directors or those charged with\ngovernance. For example, the directors or those charged with governance could adopt a basis of preparation\nbased on AAS, the Tier 2 GPFS framework, RG 85, the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the NZ Public Benefit\nEntity Simple Format Reporting \u2013 Accrual (Not-for-profit), the NZ Public Benefit Entity Simple Format\nReporting \u2013 Cash (Not-for-profit), UK FRS 102 _The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK_\n_and Republic of Ireland and other sources. Refer to paragraphs BC78, BC84, BC103 and BC106 for_\nadditional discussion.  \nBC72 The Board conducted research[31] into the number and types of specified for-profit entities lodging financial\nstatements with ASIC and concluded there were approximately 12,797 specified for-profit entities lodging  \n30 Including, for example, certain large proprietary companies that are not required to lodge financial reports with ASIC if they meet  \ncertain conditions (exempt proprietary companies).  \n31 Research Report 12.  \n-----  financial reports. This is based on the latest lodgements by all filing entities as at 30 July 2018, which was\nbefore the thresholds for large proprietary companies were doubled. Of these 12,797 entities, 6,763 were\nlarge proprietary companies,[32] 3,102 were unlisted public companies and 2,932 were small proprietary\ncompanies controlled by a foreign company. Subsequent to the revision of the large proprietary thresholds,\nthe Board expects there are approximately 10,500 specified for-profit entities that would be required to\npublicly lodge financial statements with ASIC. However, the Board was not able to obtain data on the\nnumber of other for-profit private sector entities that would be required to prepare financial statement in\naccordance with other types of legislation.",

        "page_content=": "## Not-for-profit private sector entities  \nBC73 As noted in paragraph BC55, the Board decided this Standard should apply only to for-profit private sector\nentities and that separate later consideration of the NFP private sector was needed for the following reasons:  \n(a) the removal of SPFS would have a significantly greater impact on the NFP private sector\ncompared with the for-profit private sector. Of those NFP private sector entities that are required\nto prepare financial statements and lodge them with the ACNC, research estimates that of the\n36% of large and medium charities preparing and lodging SPFS with the ACNC, only a small\nportion (26%)[33] are complying with the R&M requirements in AAS as compared to\napproximately 76% of specified for-profit private sector entities lodging financial statements with\nASIC (see paragraph BC20). The substantially lower level of compliance in the NFP private\nsector would result in a much larger proportion of the NFP private sector reporting population\nbeing impacted by the proposals compared with the for-profit private sector;  \n(b) specified for-profit private sector entities that are required to prepare financial statements that\ncomply with AAS have greater levels of economic significance, size and resources compared to\nNFP private sector entities. Proportionately, specified for-profit private sector entities are a\nsignificantly smaller number (less than 1.5% of the population of trading entities are required to\nprepare financial statements in accordance with AAS \u2013 see paragraph BC101 for more details),\nwhereas approximately 33% of charities (15,828 large and medium charities out of a total of\n47,125 charities registered with ACNC)[34] are required to prepare financial statements in\naccordance with AAS. Due to the differences in characteristics, the Board consider it more\nappropriate to consider the merits of a third tier of general purpose financial reporting for the NFP\nsector, as part of a separate project; and  \n(c) the unpublished Government (at the time of issuing this Standard) response to the ACNC\nlegislative review which outlined the potential for change in reporting thresholds and obligations\nfor affected entities. To proceed with NFP private sector financial reporting reform could be\nburdensome for certain NFP entities if the AASB would require them to comply with the R&M\nrequirements in AAS, but the ACNC subsequently relieved them of any financial reporting\nobligations once the ACNC legislative review is finalised.  \nBC74 Some respondents to ITC 39 were concerned about the NFP private sector being delayed and felt that the\nAASB should either prioritise the NFP private sector financial reporting framework reform, or should\ncontinue to work on it concurrently with the for-profit private sector financial reporting framework reform.\nThe basis of those respondents\u2019 concerns were mixed. Some were concerned that considering the for-profit\nand NFP financial reporting frameworks separately was not consistent with the objective of transaction\nneutrality and that the Board would develop different reporting requirements for the NFP sector compared\nwith the for-profit private sector, which would decrease comparability and consistency of financial reports.\nOthers were concerned the NFP private sector has specific needs that should be considered in advance or\nelse a framework may be imposed on the NFP private sector that is fit for purpose in the for-profit private\nsector but not in the NFP private sector.  \nBC75 The Board considered this feedback and noted that _The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting_\n_Framework provides for NFP sector specific modifications where justifiable. For this reason,_\nnotwithstanding the outcomes in the for-profit private sector, a thorough consideration of their\nappropriateness in accordance with _The AASB\u2019s Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework would_\nbe required, and if the for-profit financial reporting framework was determined not to be suitable for NFP  \n32 This research was performed prior to Treasury doubling the thresholds used to determine large proprietary companies. Subsequently the  \nBoard noted that Treasury\u2019s increasing of the thresholds would reduce the number of large proprietary companies to approximately\n4,500.  \n33 AASB Research Report 11 _Review of Special Purpose Financial Statements: Large and Medium Sized Australian Charities (August_  \n2019).  \n34 ACNC 2017 Annual Information Statement Data, as at 24 July 2019.  \n-----  entities, the for-profit proposals would be modified as needed.

        "page_content=": "## Legislative references to AAS and the meaning of True and Fair  \nBC76 The Board also conducted research (AASB Research Report No. 10 _Legislative and Regulatory Financial_\n_Reporting Requirements_ (September 2019)) to identify those entities with financial reporting obligations\nunder Federal and State/Territory legislation. The research grouped the identified financial reporting\nobligations into different categories, based on the nature of the financial reporting requirement (for example\na requirement to prepare financial statements according to AASB accounting standards was categorised\nseparately from a requirement to prepare financial information in accordance with AASB accounting\nstandards, which would not require preparation of a complete set of financial statements as defined in\nparagraph 10 of AASB 101. This research was then used to determine which categories of for-profit private\nsector entities should be within the scope of this Standard.  \nBC77 In particular, the Board considered whether entities that are required by legislation to prepare financial\nstatements that give a true and fair view without reference to compliance with AAS at the same time (for\nexample small co-operatives and entities reporting under state and territory gaming legislation) should be\naffected by this Standard. The Board noted the _Corporations Act 2001 envisages compliance with the_\naccounting standards might not necessarily result in financial statements that provide a true and fair view. In\naddition, the UK Financial Reporting Council paper True and Fair from June 2014 confirmed the primacy\nof the true and fair requirement above compliance with accounting standards. Following consultation with\nother regulators responsible for the legislation referring to true and fair, the Board considered that, at this\ntime, it should be a matter for each regulator to decide as to how to interpret the relevant legislation in\nrelation to \u2018true and fair view\u2019 and noted that to require compliance with AAS whenever legislation required\nentities to give a true and fair view could possibly have significant unforeseen consequences. Accordingly,\nthe Board decided the application paragraphs of AAS in this Standard should not explicitly refer to true and\nfair at this time (see category 5) in the Summary of scope table in paragraph BC93 below).  \nBC78 The Board also decided that for-profit private sector entities that are required under legislation to prepare\nfinancial information in accordance with AASB accounting standards (ie of which a complete set of\nfinancial statements under paragraph 10 of AASB 101 is not required) would not be within the scope of this\nStandard (see category 5 in the Summary of scope table in paragraph BC93 below).  \nBC79 In reviewing the legislative references, the Board noted that in some instances legislation referred to\n\u2018accounting standards\u2019, rather than \u2018Australian Accounting Standards\u2019. The Board decided that the\napplication paragraphs of AAS should include entities that are required by legislation to comply with\n\u2018accounting standards\u2019 as well as \u2018Australian Accounting standards\u2019. In making this decision, the Board\nnoted that it is reasonable to expect that legislators intended compliance with accounting standards as issued\nby the AASB when that term is used under Australian legislation (see category 5) in the Summary of scope\ntable below). For these same reasons, legislative references to other similar terms such as \u2018accounting\nprinciples\u2019 or \u2018generally accepted accounting practice\u2019 are more broad, and therefore the Board did not\nthink it was reasonable to infer they were intended to require compliance with accounting standards issued\nby the AASB and accordingly such references are not within the scope of this Standard. Further, the Board\ndecided that the application paragraphs would only capture references to AAS for entities with a nonlegislative requirement, as in those cases it is less clear as to whether the constituting document would have\nintended to refer to accounting standards as issued by the AASB, when the term \u2018accounting standards\u2019 is\nused (see category 7) in the Summary of scope table in paragraph BC93 below).",

For example,\ngovernment departments are effectively administrative constructs, and requiring Tier 1 GPFS for all such\ndepartments when they are also included in Whole of Government (WoG) GPFS means users might not be\ndirected to the key budget versus actual and service performance reporting information that would enable\ngenuine accountability. Therefore, the Board decided it would pursue financial reporting reform in the\npublic sector via consultation based on the AASB Discussion Paper _Improving Financial Reporting for_\n_Australian Public Sector, which was issued in June 2018, rather than as part of Phase 2 of ITC 39 (see_\ncategories 2, 3 and 8) in the summary of scope table in paragraph BC93 below).  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Trusts and other entities with a non-legislative requirement to comply with AAS  \nBC81 When deciding on the scope of Phase 1 of ITC 39 the Board\u2019s intention was to allow entities to maintain\ncompliance with IFRS Standards, not to extend the requirement for entities to prepare GPFS if they were\nnot currently required by legislation to do so. Respondents to ITC 39 identified some entities that may be\naffected by the amendments proposed in Phase 1, such as trusts required by their constitutional document\n(rather than legislation) to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS. They do not have any\nlegislative requirement to prepare such financial statements and may be currently preparing SPFS.\nTherefore, transitioning to GPFS could be burdensome for those trusts.  \nBC82 Consequently, the Board decided to limit Phase 1 to for-profit private sector entities that have public\naccountability and are required by legislation to comply with AAS, however it noted that the\nappropriateness of this limitation would be reconsidered as part of Phase 2 after additional research and\noutreach was performed.  \nBC83 When reconsidering the appropriateness of this limitation the Board considered entities with a nonlegislative requirement to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS more broadly than just those\naffected by Phase 1, noting there were likely to be a significant number of additional trusts possibly affected\nby Phase 2.  \nBC84 Based on discussions with legal advisors and additional targeted outreach, it is expected that the constituting\ndocuments of most trusts contain a requirement for them to prepare financial statements in compliance with\nAAS (albeit they might refer to \u2018accounting standards\u2019). These financial statements are prepared for a\nspecific purpose and a specific user (eg the beneficiaries of a trust). It is also understood that many such\nentities, particularly \u2018non-corporate\u2019 trusts, prepare SPFS.  \nBC85 The Board noted that:  \n(a) as the financial statements are prepared for specific users, those users have the ability to\ncommand whatever information they require from the entity;  \n(b) there is no external regulator of financial reporting for trusts; and  \n(c) the financial statements of trusts are not lodged on public record.  \nBC86 For these reasons, the Board considered whether it was appropriate to provide some form of relief to them,\nas the Board noted that while changing constitutional documents to remove the requirement to comply with\nAAS is possible, it can be onerous and if not done correctly can have tax consequences.  \nBC87 Targeted outreach was undertaken to understand the number of trusts that may be affected by this Standard,\nincluding their size (with reference to income and assets). This was to determine whether it was possible to\ndevelop objective criteria related to economic significance for distinguishing between those trusts that\nshould be required to comply with this Standard and those that should be exempted. The Board considered\nwhether the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary company could be an\nappropriate benchmark for this purpose.  \nBC88 While there are a large number of trusts undertaking business activities and therefore lodging tax returns\nwith the ATO, data provided by the ATO indicates that a small minority of them would meet the increased\nincome and assets thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary company.  \nBC89 The Board also noted there are entities other than trusts that may currently have a requirement to prepare\nfinancial statements in accordance with AAS in their compliance documents but are not required to do so by\nlegislation, such as partnerships, joint arrangements and self-managed superannuation funds, as well as\nentities subject to other requirements such as lending agreements. As these entities also have specific users,\nthe Board decided that the issues identified above would be equally relevant to such entities.  \nBC90 The Board therefore decided that existing for-profit private sector entities should be provided with an\nexemption from the requirement to prepare GPFS where they do not have a legislative requirement to\nprepare financial statements that comply with AAS. However, the Board decided this exemption should\nonly apply where their constituting document (or another document) requiring them to comply with AAS\nwas created or amended before 1 July 2021 (the effective date of the Standard) \u2013 ie any amendments to or\ncreation of such documents on or after 1 July 2021 would require the entity to prepare GPFS where it\nreferred to the preparation of financial statements that comply with AAS (see category 6) in the Summary\nof scope table below). If an entity were required to make any amendment to the constituting document for\nany reason after the effective date of this Standard, then the trustee for example could at the same time\namend the financial reporting requirements, subject to the agreement of the beneficiaries. Further, the relief\nshould not be available to an entity whose constituting document was created after the effective date of the  \n-----  amendments, as when drafting the constituting document, the beneficiaries should have determined their\ninformation needs including whether or not they required GPFS.  \nBC91 Respondents to ED 297 expressed mixed views on such an exception. Whilst a minority considered no\nexemption was necessary, others supported providing relief in other ways. For example:  \n(a) specifying a \u2018sunset\u2019 date on the exemption, or in other words, providing an extended transition\nperiod for such entities compared to entities required by legislation to prepare financial\nstatements in accordance with AAS; or  \n(b) providing a permanent exemption for such entities.  \nBC92 The Board considered this feedback and decided that providing a \u2018sunset\u2019 date on the exemption would not\nmeet the objective of providing the exception, because instead of alleviating entities of the potential\nconsequences of changing a trust deed noted in paragraphs BC86 for example, it would only defer such\nconsequences until a later date. Further, the Board reconsidered providing a permanent exemption, and\nconfirmed it would not be appropriate, as providing a permanent exemption would perpetuate the SPFS\nissue, and cause further interpretative confusion as to whether such a reference is or is not intended to\nrequire GPFS. The Board therefore decided to retain exemption for only limited circumstances, consistent\nwith the proposals in ED 297.",

The Phase 2 approach in\nITC 39 contemplated revising the Tier 2 GPFS framework in AASB 1053 to include one of two alternatives\nas noted in paragraph BC56:  \n(a) RDR \u2013 The existing Tier 2 GPFS framework as currently exists in AASB 1053, consisting of full\nR&M, including consolidation and equity accounting (where applicable) with reduced disclosures\nfrom each applicable AAS; and  \n(b) SDR \u2013 A new Tier 2 GPFS framework that would consist of full R&M including consolidation\nand equity accounting (where applicable), however with specified disclosures from some AAS.\nThose standards are those that are currently mandatory for entities required to prepare financial\nstatements in accordance with Chapter 2M of the _Corporations Act 2001, being AASB 101,_\nAASB 107, AASB 108, AASB 1048 and AASB 1054, plus the disclosures required by\nAASB 124 Related Party Disclosures, AASB 136 Impairment of Assets, AASB 15 Revenue from\n_Contracts with Customers and AASB 112 Income Taxes._  \nBC96 As noted in paragraph BC58, the feedback from the roundtables, user and preparer surveys and submissions\non Phase 2 of ITC 39 indicated that:  \n(a) RDR has too many disclosure requirements; and  \n-----  (b) SDR was too much in some ways but fell short in many other ways. For example, the feedback\nreceived from roundtables, user and preparer surveys and submissions on Phase 2 of ITC 39 was\nthat whilst the disclosures in SDR are important, requiring all disclosures from those nine\nStandards was too much. Most participants further suggested that SDR might not be appropriate\nfor all industry sectors and is missing some critical disclosures to help predict the viability of an\nentity such as liquidity, contingent liabilities, subsequent events and commitments.  \nBC97 As a consequence, the Board decided to propose a third alternative to replace the current disclosure aspects\nof Tier 2 GPFS disclosure framework, being a new and separate disclosure standard for entities reporting\nunder the Tier 2 GPFS framework, termed \u2018Simplified Disclosures\u2019. It would be based on the disclosure\nrequirements of the IFRS for SMEs Standard, but retain the R&M requirements in AAS.  \nBC98 The disclosures required by the Simplified Disclosures Standard are set out in a separate but related\nStandard, AASB 1060, and have been developed via a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach based on the disclosures in the\nIFRS for SMEs Standard, without reference to the full IFRS disclosures (ie no shading). The Board\u2019s\ndecisions on the content of the Simplified Disclosures Standard are set out in the Basis for Conclusions to\nAASB 1060.",

        "page_content=": "## One Tier 2 GPFS Framework  \nBC99 Some respondents to Phase 2 of ITC 39 suggested that more than one Tier 2 GPFS framework was\nnecessary, as having only one Tier 2 GPFS framework is too limited.  \nBC100 The Board noted transition costs, and the ongoing costs of training and maintenance of either two Tier 2\nGPFS frameworks or even three tiers of GPFS reporting for users, preparers, auditors and regulators for\nonly 1.3%[37] of actively trading entities outweighed any potential benefits.  \nBC101 As noted in paragraph BC73, the Board observed that of the 2.5 million companies registered with ASIC in\n2016-2017, only approximately 840,000 were actively trading, and of those there were only approximately\n12,797 specified for-profit private sector entities that were required to prepare and lodge financial\nstatements (at July 2018). This represents approximately only 1.5% of the total population of trading\nentities. The Board further noted that Treasury\u2019s increase of the large proprietary company thresholds\nwould further reduce this number to 1.3% of the population of trading entities. The Board noted that this is\na very small proportion of the total number of trading entities and having one Tier 2 GPFS framework for\nthis population was sufficient.  \nBC102 The Board also noted the results of a survey conducted by an accounting firm in Australia that asked\nrespondents to answer a polling question regarding whether additional tier(s) of GPFS reporting should be\nconsidered. In response, 52% (118 of the 228 respondents) stated no, 18% (41 of the 228 respondents)\nstated yes and 30% (69 of the 228 respondents) weren\u2019t sure. The Board however noted that of those\nrespondents who answered \u2018yes\u2019 to this question, a number of them provided suggestions specific to the\nNFP sector.  \nBC103 Some respondents felt that additional tiers of GPFS reporting with varying degrees of disclosure may be\nuseful, as entities preparing financial statements range in size and complexity. The Board emphasised that\nentities without a statutory requirement to comply with AAS, such as those below the now doubled large\nproprietary company thresholds in the _Corporations Act 2001, would be able to continue to tailor their_\nfinancial statements to the needs of their specific users and therefore additional tiers of GPFS reporting\nwere not required. Further, there are only an estimated maximum of approximately 4,500 entities\n(subsequent to Treasury increasing the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary\ncompany) that may be required to prepare financial statements under Part 2M.3 of the _Corporations Act_\n_2001 who would be able to use a Tier 2 GPFS framework (including those currently preparing Tier 1 and_\nTier 2 GPFS).  \nBC104 Further, separating this already small proportion of the total population (ie 1.3% or approximately 10,500\nentities) into more than one tier would require objective criteria on which to make this separation.\nTreasury\u2019s consultation on its proposals to increase the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a\nlarge proprietary company considered this, and determined there should only be a large, small distinction.  \nBC105 As noted in paragraph BC71, entities not subject to this Standard (or the requirements in AASB 2019-1)\nwould continue to be able to prepare SPFS if they classify themselves as non-reporting entities.  \nBC106 Further, as noted in paragraph BC45(b), the few AAS that are mandatory for SPFS are focussed on the\npresentation of and disclosure in financial statements, rather than R&M requirements, and cannot be\nconsidered an appropriate financial reporting framework. For this reason, when preparing SPFS, directors  \n37 This is subsequent to Treasury increasing the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary company.  \n-----  and those charged with governance are responsible for determining the financial reporting framework of the\nentity by specifying the accounting policies (ie R&M requirements). The directors and those charged with\ngovernance are also responsible for ensuring the financial reporting framework is appropriate to meet the\nneeds of the users of their SPFS.  \nBC107 A key theme noted through submissions and outreach on Phase 2 of ITC 39 was the need for comparability\nacross publicly lodged financial statements, particularly in relation to R&M requirements (see paragraphs\nBC108-BC113). As such, the Board decided that creating additional tiers of GPFS reporting for such a\nsmall proportion of the total population of trading entities would not adequately meet the objective of\ncreating a consistent and comparable financial reporting framework, and could lead to unnecessary\ncomplexity for financial statement users of such a small proportion of the population when trying to\ndetermine which tier of GPFS reporting requirements have been applied to the financial statements. Further,\nseparating this population into two separate tiers would require objective criteria on which to make this\nseparation. As noted in paragraph BC104 above Treasury had consulted on the thresholds used for\ndetermining what constitutes a large proprietary company and determined there should only be a large,\nsmall distinction. Also, small foreign-controlled entities would likely be required to use the R&M\nrequirements of their parent entities that are unlikely to be using the IFRS for SMEs Standard, and finally,\napproximately 90%[38] of unlisted public companies preparing and lodging financial statements with ASIC\nalready comply with the R&M requirements in AAS.",

        "page_content=": "## R&M requirements of Tier 2  \nBC108 The Board noted the strong preference expressed by respondents to Phase 2 of ITC 39 for a framework that\nincludes the full R&M requirements in AAS as it would enhance the comparability, consistency and\ntransparency of the financial statements. Feedback from targeted outreach emphasised that users agreed that\nthe usefulness of information within financial statements for decision making is adversely affected where\nentities have not consistently applied the R&M requirements in AAS.  \nBC109 The findings noted in Research Report 12 estimates that 76% of specified for-profit entities that are lodging\nSPFS with ASIC are complying with the R&M requirements in AAS (see paragraph BC20). Therefore, the\nBoard considered that moving to a Tier 2 GPFS framework that is not based on the full R&M requirements\nin AAS is counter-intuitive when trying to improve the consistency, comparability, usefulness and\ncredibility of financial reporting in Australia.  \nBC110 The Board did however re-evaluate the suitability of the IFRS for SMEs Standard as the Tier 2 GPFS\nframework in Australia and reconfirmed that the full IFRS for SMEs Standard continues not to be a\npreferred option for the for-profit private sector in Australia for the following reasons:  \n(a) users specifically identified the comparability of the R&M requirements in AAS as a key\nconcern. The IFRS for SMEs Standard has different R&M requirements compared to AAS, and to\nmeet user needs for comparability, all for-profit private sector entities within the scope of this\nStandard would need to apply the IFRS for SMEs Standard (with it being the only Tier 2 GPFS\nframework), or a third tier of GPFS reporting would need to be created;  \n(b) to achieve a consistent Tier 2 GPFS framework, additional transitional costs would be expected to\narise because based on the data in paragraph BC20, it is estimated that a majority of ASIC\nregulated entities currently lodging SPFS are already complying with the R&M requirements in\nAAS. To achieve a consistent Tier 2 GPFS framework and implement the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard, all of these entities, approximately 8,800 of the 10,500 specified for-profit entities\nlodging financial statements with ASIC (subsequent to Treasury increasing the thresholds used\nfrom determining what constitutes a large proprietary company) would need to change their\naccounting policies to adjust for the different R&M requirements contained in the IFRS for SMEs\nStandard. That is, all of the specified for-profit entities preparing Tier 1 GPFS, Tier 2 GPFS or\nSPFS which comply with the R&M requirements in AAS.  \nIn comparison only the 10% that currently don\u2019t comply with the R&M requirements in AAS and\npotentially the 14% where it\u2019s unclear whether or not they have complied with the R&M\nrequirements in AAS (approximately up to 1,700 entities in total) would be required to change\ntheir accounting policies to align with the R&M requirements in AAS. Therefore, a larger\npopulation of preparers would see an increase in the costs associated with the transition from\nSPFS to GPFS if the Tier 2 GPFS framework were based on different R&M requirements; and  \n38 Research Report 12.  \n-----  (c) having different R&M requirements is not consistent with ASIC and other regulators\u2019 views that\nthe full R&M requirements of accounting standards should be applied in order to give a \u2018true and\nfair view\u2019 of the financial position and performance of an entity.[39]  \n(d) there is no need for a third tier of GPFS reporting as approximately 98.7% of the 840,000 trading\nentities only have an obligation to prepare and lodge a tax return with the ATO. Further, creating\na third tier would require objective criteria on which to make this separation, and Treasury has\njust consulted on the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary\ncompany and determined there should only be a large, small distinction. Also, small foreigncontrolled entities would likely be required to use the R&M requirements of their parent entities\nthat are unlikely to be using the IFRS for SMEs Standard, and finally, approximately 90%[40] of\nunlisted public companies preparing and lodging financial statements with ASIC already comply\nwith the R&M requirements in AAS. Subsidiaries would also need to provide additional\ninformation to be compliant with IFRS Standards for the purpose of consolidating into their\nparent\u2019s consolidated financial statements where the parent applies Tier 1 AAS or IFRS\nStandards;  \n(e) the IFRS for SMEs Standard would result in reduced comparability between entities preparing\nfull IFRS Standards compliant financial statements because of different accounting policy\nalternatives due to different R&M requirements;  \n(f) in the event an entity moves to, or from, preparing financial statements applying full IFRS\nStandards, there would be costs involved in transitioning from the R&M requirements of one tier\nof reporting to another. Transition costs, and the ongoing costs of training and maintaining either\ntwo Tier 2 GPFS frameworks or even three tiers of GPFS reporting for users, preparers, auditors\nand regulators for only 1.3%[41] of actively trading entities would also outweigh any potential\nbenefits;  \n(g) the feedback received on Phase 2 of ITC 39 suggested that applying the consolidation and equity\naccounting requirements for the first time would be the most difficult aspect of transitioning from\nSPFS to GPFS, however consolidation and equity accounting are both required under the IFRS\nfor SMEs Standard. As such, it does not appear that adopting the IFRS for SMEs Standard would\nmitigate these concerns;  \n(h) using a single basis for the R&M requirements in AAS would support efficiency in the education\nof accountants and financial statement users;  \n(i) the use of the IFRS for SMEs Standard would decrease harmonisation with New Zealand further\nthan the requirements in this Standard, as the New Zealand financial reporting framework for forprofit entities has only two tiers and does not use the IFRS for SMEs Standard; and  \n(j) despite the issues noted above that would be faced if the IFRS for SMEs Standard were to be\nadopted, the IFRS for SMEs Standard is based on full IFRS Standards, and does not appear to\ndepart significantly from the IFRS Standards (see AASB Staff Paper _Comparison of Standards_\n_for Smaller Entities (April 2018)). This is acknowledged by the IASB in the Basis for_\nConclusions to the IFRS for SMEs Standard\u00b8 which also notes that the needs of users of financial\nstatements of small and medium sized entities are similar in many ways to the needs of users of\npublicly accountable entities.[42] As such, it appears unlikely that the benefits of moving to the\nIFRS for SMEs Standard would outweigh the costs noted above.  \nBC111 The Board also noted that any possible reduction in on-going compliance costs or alleviation of concerns\nthat the R&M requirements of IFRS Standards are too complex which may arise from having the IFRS for\nSMEs Standard as the Tier 2 GPFS framework, would not be significant enough to outweigh the loss of\nbenefit to users (ie the loss of consistency and comparability of R&M requirements in AAS), because as\nnoted above, the IFRS for SMEs Standard still requires consolidated financial statements and equity\naccounting, along with deferred tax accounting, lease accounting, fair valuing of derivatives and other\ncomplex financial instruments and related party disclosures that are not substantively different from the full\nrequirements in AAS.  \nBC112 The Board further noted that 65% of respondents to Phase 2 of ITC 39 did not agree with having the IFRS\nfor SMEs Standard as the Tier 2 GPFS framework in Australia.  \n39 See, for example, section 2 of RG85.\n40 Research Report 12.\n41 This is subsequent to Treasury increasing the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary company.\n42 IFRS for SMEs Standard, Basis for Conclusions, paragraph BC96.  \n-----  BC113 In light of the above, as noted in paragraph BC98, the Board decided to create a new and separate Tier 2\nGPFS framework that would have the R&M requirements of Tier 1 (including consolidation and equity\naccounting) and the disclosure requirements of the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  \nBC114 The new Tier 2 GPFS framework replaces the existing Tier 2 GPFS RDR framework and is available for\napplication by for-profit private sector entities that do not have public accountability, NFP private sector\nentities and public sector entities other than the Australian Government and State, Territory and Local\nGovernments.",

The Board undertook research (AASB Research\nReport No. 13 _Parent, Subsidiary and Group Financial Reporting) to assess the suitability of current_\nreporting requirements where the views of different lending institutions were sought. The feedback received\nshowed there is a need for both a full set of subsidiary financial statements and the consolidated financial\nstatements of the group. Feedback received from users in response the AASB\u2019s user survey and submissions\nto ITC 39 also highlighted the need for consolidated financial statements.  \nBC117 The majority of the lending institutions interviewed mentioned that in the case of group structures, they\nrequire the consolidated financial statements of the group to make their lending decisions and that these are\nparticularly important when:  \n(a) there is structural subordination within group structures;  \n(b) there is a deed of cross guarantee;  \n(c) banks have legal recourse to the assets of the consolidated group;  \n(d) lending to a subsidiary is in the form of a credit enhancement to the whole group; and  \n(e) lending to a subsidiary that does not have substantial operations and it is a financing vehicle.  \nBC118 Similarly, feedback from users mentioned that in order to make decisions, they require:  \n(a) consolidated financial statements including note disclosures (which include all assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses of the parent and all subsidiaries); and / or  \n(b) consolidated financial statements including note disclosures plus some parent entity information\nto understand their dividend paying capacity.  \nBC119 The feedback noted in paragraphs BC117-BC118 provided further support to the Board\u2019s view that\nconsolidated financial statements are essential to provide users with transparent and complete information\nabout the financial position and financial performance of the group and the entities in the group.  \nBC120 Further information on the Board\u2019s decisions in relation to the revised Tier 2 GPFS framework is available\nin the Basis for Conclusions to AASB 1060.  \nBC121 Although the Board decided that a revised Tier 2 GPFS framework would help facilitate the removal of\nSPFS, it also decided that transitional relief in addition to what is currently available in AASB 1 was\nwarranted to further assist entities with transition from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS where they choose to early\nadopt this Standard, as noted in paragraphs BC122-BC135.",

As such, the Board included specific matters for\ncomment in ITC 39 seeking feedback on what transitional relief should be provided, in addition to that\nalready available in AASB 1.

        "page_content=": "## Options considered  \nBC124 In deliberating the options for transitional relief, the Board noted AASB 1053 requires an entity to either\napply all the relevant requirements in AASB 1 or the requirements in AASB 108 to transition from SPFS to\nTier 2 GPFS, if that entity had not applied or had only selectively applied the R&M requirements in AAS.  \nBC125 In light of constituent feedback that consolidation and equity accounting would be the most challenging\naspects of transition, the Board considered the relief provided by AASB 1 from the need to retrospectively\naccount for past business combinations (a specific challenge noted for consolidation and equity accounting).\nThe Board concluded that the application of AASB 1 provides significant and sufficient relief to address the\nstakeholder concerns noted in paragraph BC123(a).  \nBC126 The Board also noted:  \n(a) **Doubling of thresholds for large proprietary companies:** As noted in paragraph BC35,\nTreasury doubled the thresholds used for determining what constitutes a large proprietary\ncompany. Based on the data available from a data aggregator for the latest lodgements by all\nfiling entities as at 30 June 2018 (being before the doubling of the thresholds), as noted in\nparagraph BC72, there were a total of 6,763 large proprietary companies that had lodged financial\nstatements with ASIC, out of which 5,500 entities filed SPFS. The doubling of the thresholds\nreduced the total population of large proprietary companies by approximately one third. Based on\nthe revised thresholds, the same data from a data aggregator indicates that a maximum of\napproximately 3,666 large proprietary companies would be required by this Standard to transition\nfrom SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS.  \nIn addition, the Board noted the Explanatory Statement accompanying the revision of the\nthresholds that had outlined the expectation that larger entities are more likely to have users that\nare dependent on the entity\u2019s GPFS. Further, the Explanatory Statement also noted that the\naverage access rates for financial reports through ASIC for the remaining population of large\nproprietary companies is significantly higher than for those entities that would now be small\nproprietary companies (see paragraph BC40(c)).  \nThe Board considered that such economically significant companies are expected to have\nsufficient skills and resources to cope with any transitional challenges within the current\nrequirements.  \n(b) **Findings from Research Report 12:** One of the key findings of this research is that overall it is\nestimated that 76% of specified for-profit entities lodging SPFS with ASIC comply with the\nR&M requirements in AAS; 10% did not comply with the R&M requirements in AAS, while for\nthe remaining 14% it was unclear whether or not they complied with the R&M requirements in\nAAS. As noted in paragraph BC124, entities already applying all of the R&M requirements of\nAAS would not require transitional relief.  \nWhile the Board noted that these results focused only on compliance with R&M requirements in\ntheir lodged SPFS and therefore did not identify whether entities prepared consolidated financial\nstatements, the results show that out of approximately 7,295[43] for-profit entities lodging SPFS\nwith ASIC following the revision of the large proprietary company thresholds, only 10% to 24%\n(approximately 600 to 1,700 entities) are expected to be affected by this Standard. This is because\n76% of the specified for-profit entities lodging SPFS with ASIC are already complying with the\nR&M requirements in AAS. The Board also noted that this number may be further reduced as the  \n43 3,666 large proprietary companies, 1,252 unlisted public companies not limited by guarantee and 2,377 small foreign-controlled  \nproprietary companies  \n-----  research showed a clear correlation between entity size and compliance with the R&M\nrequirements in AAS, with the level of compliance increasing with company size.  \nFurther, the Board noted that the primary reason for 6% of entities that did not comply with the\nR&M requirements in AAS was due to not applying AASB 112 in full, however constituents\nhave not raised AASB 112 as being problematic for the purpose of transition.  \n(c) **Insufficient compelling evidence from extensive outreach:** The Board performed extensive\noutreach and asked for specific information on transitional relief that might be needed through\nformal comments on ITC 39, roundtables in capital cities and over 200 meetings with individual\nstakeholders, and did not receive compelling evidence or suggestions identifying specific issues\nthat needed transitional relief. Further, no specific feedback was received from small foreigncontrolled proprietary companies or unlisted public companies not limited by guarantee.  \n(d) **_The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework: The Board noted the presumption_**\nthat IFRS Standards are appropriate as a base for all entities, with particular regard to the fact that\nAASB 1, which incorporates IFRS 1 _First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting_\n_Standards, had been developed by the IASB to reduce the cost of first-time adoption of IFRS_\nStandards, so that it does not outweigh the benefits of adoption. The Board also observed that the\napplication of AASB 1 has been an appropriate base for entities transitioning to AAS since 2005,\nincluding a large number of SGEs that were required to transition from SPFS to GPFS for\nreporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2017. Paragraphs BC154-BC156 provide further\ndiscussion on how the Board applied The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework\nin arriving at the requirements in this Standard.  \n(e) **No adverse feedback from entities that transition as a result of the SGE requirements:**\nDespite specifically requesting feedback, the Board was not made aware of any significant\ntransitional issues faced by the SGEs that were required to begin lodging GPFS with the ATO.\nThese entities would have transitioned using the current requirements of AASB 1. The Board has\nalso not heard any adverse feedback from the ATO on the quality of the financial reports that\nhave been lodged.  \nFurther, the Board noted that many of the entities that have already transitioned to preparing\nGPFS as required by the SGE legislation, are entities expected to be within the scope of this\nStandard (ie they are required to prepare financial statements under Part 2M.3 of the\n_Corporations Act 2001 and are now preparing GPFS). As a result, there are likely to be fewer_\nentities required to transition from SPFS to GPFS as a result of this Standard. Further the Board\ndoes not expect the reporting requirements for these SGE entities to be any more onerous as a\nresult of this Standard (ie they will continue to prepare GPFS as required by SGE legislation).  \nBC127 Nevertheless the Board considered three possible options to provide transitional relief in addition to what is\navailable under AASB 1, as follows:  \n|Option|Nature of the relief considered|Key factors considered|\n|---|---|---|\n|\u2018Push-down accounting\u2019 for entities that are subsidiaries of an IFRS Standards and / or AAS compliant parent|To allow subsidiaries that are consolidating into the financial statements of an AAS or IFRS Standards compliant parent to recognise amounts reported in their reporting / consolidation pack (which would have been derived from acquisition date fair values) to be deemed cost in their individual financial statements (subject to requiring them to recognise only those assets and liabilities that qualify for recognition under AAS in the subsidiary\u2019s own financial statements).|The Board noted that advantages of this relief would include: (a) no need to keep two sets of parallel accounting records (ie one set for group reporting purposes and another set for its own mandatory Tier 2 GPFS); and (b) opening balances would still be based on AAS principles, albeit measured at a different point in time. However, the Board decided not to provide this relief: (a) for the reasons noted in paragraph BC126; (b) because this relief would have been inconsistent with The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard- Setting Framework\u2019s presumption that IFRS Standards are an appropriate base; (c) because anecdotally, adjusting balances to be consistent with AAS is not the most difficult area of transition, rather it is more difficult to restate|  \n-----  |Option|Nature of the relief considered|Key factors considered|\n|---|---|---|\n|||prior periods; (d) because the relief would only be available for a limited number of entities, which would likely be foreign-controlled and hence subject to public interest. It was not clear to the Board, the number of entities that would be able to utilise this relief in any case; and (e) because such relief would reduce comparability with other entities that are transitioning from SPFS to GPFS. The Board considered whether AASB 1 effectively provided such relief through other exemptions (such as event driven fair values), but did not form a view on this matter.|\n|Relief from recognising \u2018deemed goodwill\u2019 if applying paragraph C4(j) of AASB 1.|Provide a parent entity applying the relief in AASB 1 Appendix C in relation to previously unconsolidated subsidiaries with an option to write off \u2018deemed goodwill\u2019 immediately in retained earnings, rather than recognise it and then be required to undertake day 1 and annual impairment testing.|The Board noted that advantages of this relief would include: (a) the potential to reduce the cost of undertaking an impairment test at the date of transition and ongoing annually; and (b) that it would provide relief for entities consolidating for the first time, a key concern of respondents to Phase 2 of ITC 39. However, the Board decided not to provide this relief: (a) for the reasons noted in paragraph BC126; (b) because this relief would have been inconsistent with The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard- Setting Framework\u2019s presumption that IFRS Standards are an appropriate base. In particular, the Board noted that this amendment would fundamentally change the R&M requirements of AASB 1; and (c) because this relief could lead to significant loss of information about impairment for users and regulators.|\n|Relief from restating comparative information as required by AAS|To amend AASB 1 to specify that entities need not restate or present comparative information as required by AAS. This would mean the date of transition is the beginning of the reporting period (rather than the beginning of the comparative period).|The Board decided to propose this relief in ED 297, noting the advantages include: (a) the relief would facilitate the transition to GPFS in a more timely manner \u2013 for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020 (on the assumption the Standard would be issued as an amending standard prior to 30 June 2020). This would also mean that, effectively, the RCF and the removal of the ability of certain entities to prepare SPFS when they are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS would become effective for the first time in the same reporting period; (b) the relief was not expected to have implications for the R&M requirements in AAS, except to the extent that the change in the date of transition would lead to differences in opening balances based on a different date of transition; and (c) the relief would reduce costs to all entities required to transition from SPFS to GPFS.|  \n-----  |Option|Nature of the relief considered|Key factors considered|\n|---|---|---|\n|||However, the Board did note some disadvantages, including: (a) reduced information for users \u2013 particularly in making trend analyses; and (b) the approach would require divergence from the presumption in The AASB\u2019s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework that IFRS Standards are appropriate as a base, albeit it would not a major deviation.|  \nBC128 For the reasons noted in the table in paragraph BC127, the Board decided against providing additional\ntransitional relief in the form of \u2018push-down accounting\u2019 or immediate write-off of deemed goodwill against\nretained earnings. The Board sought specific feedback through ED 297 on whether it should re-consider any\nof the rejected options noted above but did not receive any further compelling reasons to do so.",

        "page_content=": "## Relief from restating and presenting comparative information  \nBC129 As noted in the table in paragraph BC127, the Board concluded that relief from the restatement and\npresentation of comparative information in accordance with current AAS would be beneficial as it could\nreduce preparation costs whilst providing a consistent, enforceable and transparent reporting framework\n(despite a lack of comparability in the year of transition). Thus the Board proposed in ED 297 that an entity\nwould not be required to provide restated comparative information as per current AAS in the year the\nStandard first becomes effective, on the premise that the Standard would be issued by 30 June 2020,\neffective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020 (see paragraphs BC145-BC148 for further discussion\non effective date).  \nBC130 However, the Board noted the particular importance for users:  \n(a) to understand the effect of an entity\u2019s transition from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS on its assets, liabilities\nand equity; and  \n(b) to have comparative information in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive\nincome to facilitate trend analysis.  \nBC131 To balance the needs of users and the costs to preparers, the Board proposed in ED 297 that a pragmatic\napproach would be to require an entity to:  \n(a) present two statements of financial position ie as at the reporting date and at the beginning of the\nreporting period, with a comparative statement of financial position as presented in the entity\u2019s\nlast SPFS disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This would be supplemented with a\ndescription of the main adjustments that were required to make the opening statement of financial\nposition compliant with AAS. To reduce costs, the Board proposed an entity need not quantify\nthose adjustments; and  \n(b) present its statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as presented in its last\nSPFS as comparative information, but clearly labelled, where applicable, that such comparative\ninformation is not AAS compliant. This would be supplemented with disclosure in the notes to\nthe financial statements describing the main adjustments that would have been required to make\nthe comparative information compliant with AAS. Also to reduce costs, the Board proposed an\nentity need not quantify those adjustments.  \nBC132 Respondents to ED 297 agreed in principle with the transitional relief, however some respondents raised\nconcern that the comparative information in the statement of financial position (being the adjusted opening\nbalances \u2013 AAS compliant) would not be comparable to the comparative information in the statement of\nprofit or loss and other comprehensive income (which would not necessarily be AAS compliant). Those\nrespondents argued that this would not be helpful for users of financial statements. Further, some software\nproviders provided feedback that having comparative information presented on different bases could be\ndifficult from both a software development and financial statement user perspective.  \nBC133 In response, the Board decided a pragmatic approach would be to require the statement of financial position\nas presented in the entity\u2019s last SPFS to be presented on the face of the statement of financial position, and\nto require the opening statement of financial position (compliant with AAS) to be disclosed in the notes.\nHowever, given the comparative information on the face of the financial statements would be less\ncomparable under this approach, the Board decided to require entities to disclose a quantified reconciliation  \n-----  of the entity\u2019s equity in the notes. The Board considered whether to require a reconciliation of the entity\u2019s\nstatement of financial position, however noted that a reconciliation of equity should provide sufficient detail\nto understand the changes to the statement of financial position, and providing a reconciliation to equity\nwould be more consistent with the general first-time disclosure requirements of AASB 1060. The Board\nnoted this requirement should not be too onerous for preparers, as they would be required to calculate these\namounts in any case.  \nBC134 Some respondents to ED 297 questioned whether not restating comparative information would mean that an\nentity would be required to disclose two sets of accounting policies (ie one set to explain the basis of\npreparation of the comparative information and one set to explain the information for the reporting period).\nThe Board decided not to provide specific requirements on the basis that the disclosure requirements of\nAASB 1060 and those contained within the relief required by the Board would provide sufficient\ninformation about the previous accounting policies in explaining the effect of the transition from SPFS to\nGPFS.  \nBC135 Because the purpose of this relief is to facilitate transition from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS in a timely manner,\nrather than a general first-time adoption of GPFS, the Board decided to propose in ED 297 that the\nadditional transitional relief from restatement of comparative information should not be available beyond\nthe first year in which the Standard becomes effective. That is, on the assumption that the Board would have\nissued the Standard by 30 June 2020 with an effective date of 1 July 2020, the Board proposed the\ntransitional relief in respect of comparative information would only be available for annual reporting\nperiods beginning on or after 1 July 2020 but before 1 July 2021.  \nBC136 However, for the reasons set out in paragraph BC145-BC151, the Board decided to defer the effective date\nof the Standard by 12 months to 1 July 2021. Because the transitional relief from restating comparative\ninformation is intended to facilitate a timely transition from SPFS to GPFS, the Board decided that an\nextended effective date would remove the need for transitional relief. However, the Board decided to retain\nthe transitional relief for entities that choose to adopt the requirements of this Standard and AASB 1060\nprior to the effective date (ie that choose to early adopt). That Board decided that retaining this option\nwould incentivise a timely transition to GPFS, helping to solve the SPFS problem sooner.  \nBC137 The Board also decided for pragmatic reasons that the transitional relief from restating comparatives will be\navailable regardless of whether an entity had a legislative or other requirement to comply with AAS in prior\nperiods.",

The Board noted this relief could be particularly relevant where an entity had\nclaimed compliance with applicable R&M requirements in error. In such a case, there were diverse views as\nto whether an entity would be permitted to apply the transitional relief in AASB 1 based on the\nrequirements of AASB 1053. As such, the Board decided to clarify in AASB 1053 that the applicability of\nAASB 1 (or AASB 108) relies on whether or not the entity complied with applicable R&M requirements,\nrather than whether the entity stated compliance with applicable R&M requirements. As such, an entity that\ndiscovered an error in its previous SPFS would still be permitted to apply the transitional relief in AASB 1\n(or elect to apply AASB 108).  \nBC139 The Board also noted that the first-time adoption disclosures in AASB 1060 would generally require an\nentity to distinguish the correction of errors and changes in accounting policies in the notes. As such, to\nprovide relief for preparers and facilitate a more timely transition to a GPFS framework, the Board decided\nnot to require an entity to distinguish errors and accounting policies in the year of transition, noting that in\nany case all adjustments would be disclosed in the financial statements regardless of their nature. The Board\nconsidered whether such an amendment would affect any other obligations of those charged with\ngovernance with respect to prior period errors, however noted that such obligations would not be\noverridden. In making that decision, the Board noted that not distinguishing prior period errors from\naccounting policy changes may not meet the Conceptual Framework\u2019s qualitative characteristic of faithful\nrepresentation, however the Board decided to make a trade-off with faithful representation to meet the\nBoard\u2019s objective in these limited circumstances.",

        "page_content=": "## Scope of transitional relief  \nBC140 In developing ED 297, the Board noted that entities already complying with the R&M requirements in AAS\nwould not need transitional relief, given that such entities are required to continue applying the applicable\nR&M requirements in accordance with AASB 1053. However, many respondents to ED 297 considered that  \n-----  the transitional relief should be available to all entities impacted, regardless of whether the SPFS previously\nissued complied with all R&M requirements. Respondents noted that providing comparative information for\ndisclosures that had not previously been made in an entity\u2019s most recent SPFS could be difficult, in\nparticular when gathering information and preparing disclosures about related parties (including key\nmanagement personnel) and income tax. The Board considered this feedback and decided that extending the\nrelief to such disclosures would be reasonable to address stakeholder feedback and facilitate timely\ntransition to GPFS. The Board decided to limit the relief only to instances where the comparative\ninformation had not previously been disclosed, on the basis that the entity would have all other comparative\ninformation available to them.  \nBC141 The Board also decided that it would be appropriate to amend the requirements in AASB 1053 for the\ntransition from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS generally, as the Board was aware there were mixed views amongst\nstakeholders as to whether or not consolidation was to be considered a R&M requirement. The Board\ndecided to make amendments to paragraph 18A to explicitly state that entities would be able to apply either\nAASB 1 (including the relief for preparing consolidated financial statements in Appendix C) or AASB 108\nfor first-time adoption of GPFS where a parent entity either:  \n(a) did not apply the requirements of AASB 10 and hence did not prepare consolidated financial\nstatements; or  \n(b) did not prepare consolidated financial statements on the basis that neither the entity nor the\nconsolidated entity was not a reporting entity, and hence was not required by paragraph Aus4.2 to\nprepare consolidated financial statements where the entity was an ultimate Australian parent.  \nBC142 In respect of BC141(b), the Board decided that even though such an entity would have technically complied\nwith the R&M requirements of AASB 10 (because it was not required to consolidate), because the\namendments in this Standard mean that the reference to a reporting entity in AASB 10 paragraph Aus4.2 is\nremoved, the Board considered it appropriate to make available the same transitional relief as would be\navailable for entities previously not complying with AASB 10. The Board considered whether to also\nextend such relief to entities preparing separate GPFS on the same basis (ie applying AASB 10 paragraph\nAus4.2), however decided this would not be appropriate at this time as the extent of the entities impacted is\ncurrently unknown, but is expected to be limited, and as:  \n(a) the Board expects that such entities should already have comprehensive IFRS-compliant\ninformation available to help produce consolidated financial statements, as the entity would be\nreporting that information to its parent; and  \n(b) entities currently preparing SPFS would also be required to provide new additional disclosure as\nwell as potentially changes to R&M, hence it could be argued that not having such other\nchallenges would mean entities already preparing GPFS would have enough resources to\nretrospectively consolidate.  \nBC143 The Board considered whether to explicitly refer also to the equity method of accounting for investments in\nassociates and joint ventures, and concluded that this was not necessary. As the equity method of\naccounting affects the measurement of the investments and the presentation in the statement of profit or loss\nand other comprehensive income, it is clear that the existing references in paragraph 18A to the R&M\nrequirements of AAS cover application of the equity method. In any case, paragraph 9 of AASB 1053 now\nstates that the R&M requirements include both consolidation and the equity method of accounting. The\nexplicit references to consolidated financial statements added to paragraph 18A therefore emphasise their\ncoverage.  \nBC144 The Board noted that paragraph 18A(a) and 18A(b) of AASB 1053 as amended would permit an entity to\napply the transition relief available under AASB 1, and thus potentially restate recognised amounts, even if\nthe previous SPFS applied all the applicable R&M requirements of AAS, except for the consolidation\nrequirements in AASB 10.",

        "page_content=": "## Effective date  \nBC145 In proposing an effective date in ED 297, the Board considered available policies and precedent, including:  \n(a) the amendments to the tax law requiring SGEs to lodge GPFS with the ATO were issued in\nDecember 2015, and required lodgement to the ATO for \u2018income years\u2019 commencing on or after\n1 July 2016. However, the ATO provided transitional concessions in the first year, whereby it\nallowed entities with reporting periods ending on 30 June 2017 additional time to lodge those\nfinancial statements, with lodgement due by 31 March 2018. It also permitted foreign-controlled\nentities to lodge financial statements in accordance with another set of Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP) other than AAS (eg US GAAP);  \n-----  (b) the AASB issued the first principal version of AASB 1 in July 2004, prior to the effective date of\nfull adoption of the Australian-equivalents to IFRS Standards of annual periods beginning on or\nafter 1 January 2005. The FRC provided the AASB with the directive to adopt IFRS Standards in\n2002. Given that all entities would have applied AASB 1 on Australia\u2019s transition to IFRS\nStandards, this length of time is arguably indicative of how much time might need to be provided\nfor a transition from SPFS to GPFS; and  \n(c) the now superseded AASB _Policies and Processes outlines in paragraph 32 that \u201cwhen_\ndetermining the effective date of Standards the AASB seeks to ensure that constituents have\nadequate time to prepare for their implementation. In normal circumstances the AASB will issue\na Standard a significant time before its effective date, say, during the previous annual reporting\nperiod and generally permits entities to apply those requirements early should they wish to do\nso\u201d.  \nBC146 The Board also noted that a timely effective date would be welcomed by users of financial statements, and\nmay also be preferred by preparers. This is because:  \n(a) the regulations in relation to the doubling of the thresholds used for determining what constitutes\na large proprietary company are applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2019.\nThe Board noted that the commentary contained in the Explanatory Statement to those\nregulations may be persuasive in an entity reconsidering its status as a non-reporting entity. As\nsuch, if entities were to reassess and determine that they were in fact a reporting entity, it would\nbe preferable for the revised Tier 2 GPFS framework and the RCF to be applicable at the same\ntime as for other publicly accountable for-profit private sector entities (annual periods beginning\non or after 1 January 2020); and  \n(b) a large proportion of affected entities (76% - refer paragraph BC20) are already complying with\nthe R&M requirements in AAS.  \nBC147 As noted in the table in paragraph BC127, the Board also concluded that providing relief from restating\ncomparative information in the year of transition would be particularly beneficial as it could allow for an\nearlier effective date. As such, with regard to the above considerations, the Board decided to propose an\neffective date of annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020 in ED 297. The Board noted this would\neffectively align with the effective date of the RCF, given most Australian for-profit private sector entities\nwould have reporting dates of 30 June.  \nBC148 Further, the Board noted the timeliness of completing this project, in order to provide an option for large\nproprietary companies to early adopt the RCF, applicable transitional relief and Tier 2 GPFS framework for\nperiods beginning on or after 1 July 2019 (ie aligned with the doubling of the thresholds used for\ndetermining what constitutes a large proprietary company).  \nBC149 Respondents to ED 297 expressed mixed views on the proposed effective date, with many recommending\nthe Board defer the effective date by 1-2 years. Reasons for deferral suggested by respondents include:  \n(a) to provide time for education, software and process changes;  \n(b) challenges caused by first-time consolidation, for example gathering AAS-compliant information\nfrom subsidiaries;  \n(c) deferring the effective date would dismiss the need for transitional relief;  \n(d) the _AASB_ _Due Process Framework for Setting Standards_ (September 2019) (Due Process\nFramework) suggests an implementation period of 2 years in typical cases; and  \n(e) whilst the effective date appeared appropriate for entities that should have been complying with\nRG 85 (ie entities required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the _Corporations_\n_Act 2001), it may be too soon for other for-profit entities within the scope that had not previously_\nhad RG 85 to guide their financial reporting framework.  \nBC150 In addition, because ED 297 and ED 295 are complementary \u2013 that is, the revised Tier 2 framework is an\nintegral piece of the removal of SPFS \u2013 the Board also considered the comments to ED 295 addressing the\neffective date, which included in addition to the responses noted above:  \n(a) that the revised Tier 2 framework should be delayed until the direction of the IASB\u2019s Subsidiaries\n_that are SMEs project is finalised, due to the multiple framework changes that could occur if the_\nAASB were to adopt the IASB\u2019s solution shortly after implementing its own simplified disclosure\nstandard; and  \n(b) to give time for the NZASB to decide the direction for its own Tier 2 framework in an attempt to\nretain trans-Tasman convergence for for-profit entities.  \n-----  BC151 The Board considered a range of options to determine the most appropriate solution to balance the urgency\nof solving the SPFS problem whilst providing sufficient time for stakeholders to transition:  \n|Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|\n|---|---|---|\n|Option 1 Effective date of 1 July 2021 Transitional relief available to all entities (R&M compliant and non-compliant) which elect to early adopt No transitional relief to entities adopting from 1 July 2021|Stakeholders will have more time to prepare for the significant change to the financial reporting framework including education and collation of historical information Transitional relief may incentivise voluntarily early adoption The effective date would be consistent with the AASB\u2019s Due Process Framework that suggest an implementation period of 2 years Retaining transitional relief for those that early adopt provides an incentive to transition in a timely manner Software providers have expressed concerns about their ability to create templates in a timely manner and also the presentation of \u2018mixed\u2019 comparatives|Effective date would not be aligned with the change in proprietary company thresholds. Large proprietary companies would likely need to prepare GPFS prior to the effective date to be consistent with Treasury\u2019s expectations regarding GPFS financial report by large proprietary companies There is a strong desire for transparent and high-quality financial statements. The recent parliamentary inquiry highlighted even more the need for change in financial reporting. Delaying the effective date is inconsistent with this|\n|Option 2 No change to transitional relief and effective date|Effective date would be aligned with the change in proprietary company thresholds The project will be completed more quickly, therefore responding to the strong desire for transparent and high-quality financial statements and recent parliamentary inquiry There are only a maximum of 7,295 entities expected to be effected, and with the effect for the majority of these entities (5,589) expected to be limited to providing additional disclosures only coupled with the transitional relief an earlier effective date was considered reasonable|Stakeholders are concerned they do not have sufficient time to prepare for such a significant change to the financial reporting framework including education and collation of historical information. However, research strongly suggests that deferring the effective date of new standards does not necessarily result in entities using the extended lead time to better prepare for the new requirements, instead it is often used to delay starting to prepare.44 Software providers have expressed concerns about their ability to create templates in a timely manner and also the presentation of \u2018mixed\u2019 comparatives The effective date is not consistent with the AASB\u2019s Due Process Framework that suggest an implementation period of 2 years|\n|Option 3 Effective date of 1 July 2021 No transitional relief|Similar as those for Option 1 above Transition requirements would be consistent with those applied by SGEs|Similar as those for Option 1 above There is no incentive for entities to early adopt|  \n44 Davern, M., Gyles, N., Potter, B. and Yang, V.

As such the entities preparing first time consolidation would be given extra time to prepare for any changes that might be required|Disadvantages of deferred effective date similar as for Option 1 above|\n|Option 5 Staggered implementation Corporations Act entities to apply the requirements in year one Effective date deferred by a further year for all other entities in scope|Effective date would be aligned with the change in proprietary company thresholds. All entities regulated by Corporations Act, which are in the scope of this Standard would comply with R&M requirements of AAS in a timely manner It is expected that entities required to prepare financial reports in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 should already be complying with the R&M requirements in AAS - as there are only a maximum of 7,295 entities expected to be effected, this option is not expected to be too onerous for Corporations Act entities. As the population of other entities is unknown, and they do not have a RG 85 equivalent, an additional year to prepare would be beneficial|The resolution of the problems with SPFS reporting would take an additional year for entities not regulated by the Corporations Act|  \nBC152 The Board ultimately decided that Option 1 provided the most appropriate solution, for the reasons set out\nin paragraph BC151 above.  \nBC153 In respect of the issues raised in respect of the revised Tier 2 framework (see paragraph BC150), the Board\ndecided that the need to remove SPFS for the entities within the scope of this Standard in a timely manner\nwould mean that waiting for the IASB and retaining trans-Tasman convergence (in the short term) would\nnot meet the objective of the project (see the Basis for Conclusions to AASB 1060 for the Board\u2019s\nconsiderations on these matters).",

The objective of these research activities was to\nbetter understand the cost implications of disallowing entities required to prepare financial\nstatements that comply with AAS to prepare SPFS and require them to prepare GPFS instead;  \n(d) considering whether it was necessary to provide transitional relief in addition to that currently\navailable under AASB 1 and AASB 108 with the objective of minimising any undue costs in\nrelation to both the transition from SPFS to GPFS and the associated disclosure requirements; and  \n(e) a consideration of matters relevant to Regulation Impact Statement (RIS) requirements.",

        "page_content=": "## Amendments required to implement Phase 2  \nBC157 As noted in paragraph BC54, in May 2019 the Board made AASB 2019-1 to implement Phase 1 of the\nBoard\u2019s phased approach to implementing the IASB\u2019s RCF in Australia, limiting the application of the\nBoard\u2019s _Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework) to for-profit private_\nsector entities with public accountability that are required by legislation to prepare financial statements that\ncomply with AAS.  \nBC158 In this Standard, to facilitate the implementation of Phase 2, the following amendments are made:  \n(a) the applicability of the Conceptual Framework is extended so that it applies to:  \n(i) for profit-private sector entities that are required by legislation to comply with either\nAustralian Accounting Standards or accounting standards (with the previous limitation\nto entities with public accountability removed);  \n(ii) other for-profit private sector entities that are required only by their constituting\ndocument or another document to comply with Australian Accounting Standards (and\nso excluding requirements to comply merely with \u2018accounting standards\u2019), provided\nthat the relevant document was created or amended on or after 1 July 2021; and  \n(iii) other for-profit entities (including for-profit public sector entities) that elect to prepare\nGPFS; and  \n(b) the existing Conceptual Framework and SAC 1 are also amended so that they do not apply to all\nfor-profit entities that are applying the _Conceptual Framework. Consequential amendments are_\nmade to the applicability of the reporting entity definition in AASB 1057, which is not relevant to\nentities applying the Conceptual Framework.  \nBC159 Therefore, with these amendments, an entity that is required to apply the _Conceptual Framework cannot_\nidentify as a non-reporting entity under SAC 1 or AASB 1057. As a consequence, the ability of such an\nentity to prepare SPFS is removed and the entity will be required to prepare GPFS that comply with AAS\n(or accounting standards under legislative requirements). For the avoidance of doubt, an entity applying the\n_Conceptual Framework cannot apply the definition of reporting entity outlined in SAC 1 or AASB 1057._  \nBC160 The application paragraph of AASB 1057 is extended to state that it will apply to for-profit private sector\nentities that are required by legislation to comply with either AAS or accounting standards, and other for  \n-----  profit private sector entities that are required only by their constituting document or another document to\ncomply with AAS (provided that the relevant document was created or amended on or after 1 July 2021).\nThe application paragraphs of the other Standards and Interpretations, as set out in AASB 1057, are\nextended similarly.  \nBC161 In respect of entities that voluntarily choose to prepare GPFS, the Board proposed in ED 297 to permit such\nentities to apply either the revised _Conceptual Framework or the_ _Framework for the Preparation and_\n_Presentation of Financial Statements. However, many respondents disagreed with this proposal, and_\npreferred that voluntary GPFS preparers are restricted to applying only the revised Conceptual Framework.\nIn response, the Board decided to require entities that voluntarily prepare GPFS to apply the revised\n_Conceptual Framework once it becomes applicable. The Board considered that allowing either framework_\nfor voluntary GPFS preparation could perpetuate problems that this Standard intended to resolve, such as\nmaintaining two conceptual frameworks (which will anyway occur in the medium term due to other\nexemptions), creating confusion about what compliance with AAS means, and two entities preparing GPFS\nmay adopt different accounting policies for like transactions. Allowing either framework also means that\npreparing GPFS would not necessarily lead to IFRS compliance.  \nBC162 The AusCF paragraphs in AAS that were introduced in AASB 2019-1 do not need to be amended in this\nStandard. The definition of AusCF entities as NFP entities and for-profit entities that are not applying the\n_Conceptual Framework, as introduced in AASB 2019-1, will continue to apply, but with a limited scope_\nsuch that those paragraphs would only be relevant to FP entities not within the scope of this Standard. The\nphase 2 amendments reduce the set of for-profit entities that are not applying the Conceptual Framework.  \n-----  ",
