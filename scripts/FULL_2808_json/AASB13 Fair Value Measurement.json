For some assets and\nliabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and\nliabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the\nobjective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same\u2014to estimate the price at which an orderly\n_transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the_\nmeasurement date under current market conditions (ie an _exit price at the measurement date from the_\nperspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).  \n3 When a price for an identical asset or liability is not observable, an entity measures fair value using another\nvaluation technique that maximises the use of relevant _observable inputs and minimises the use of_\n_unobservable inputs. Because fair value is a market-based measurement, it is measured using the_\nassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions\nabout risk. As a result, an entity\u2019s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not\nrelevant when measuring fair value.  \n4 The definition of fair value focuses on assets and liabilities because they are a primary subject of accounting\nmeasurement. In addition, this Standard shall be applied to an entity\u2019s own equity instruments measured at\nfair value.",

However, an entity\u2019s current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best\nuse unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the\nvalue of the asset.  \nAus29.1 Notwithstanding paragraph 29, a not-for-profit public sector entity is required to consider\nwhether, for a non-financial asset not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows,\nthe asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use only when, at the measurement date, it\nis:  \n(a) classified as held for sale or held for distribution to owners in accordance with AASB 5\n_Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations; or_  \n(b) highly probable that the asset will be used for an alternative purpose to its current use,\nin accordance with paragraph Aus29.2.  \nAus29.2 For the purposes of paragraph Aus29.1(b), it is highly probable that the asset will be used for an\nalternative purpose to its current use when, at the measurement date, all the following conditions\nare met:  \n(a) the alternative purpose for the asset is physically possible, legally permissible and\nfinancially feasible in accordance with paragraphs 28 and Aus28.1;  \n(b) the appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to change the use of the\nasset to that alternative purpose, and an active programme to complete the plan has\nbeen initiated;  \n(c) any approvals required to change the asset\u2019s use have been obtained; and  \n(d) based on reasonably available information, it is highly probable that the current use of\nthe asset will cease under the plan within one year.  \n30 To protect its competitive position, or for other reasons, an entity may intend not to use an acquired nonfinancial asset actively or it may intend not to use the asset according to its highest and best use.

The liability would not be settled with the counterparty or**\n**otherwise extinguished on the measurement date.**  \n**(b)** **An entity\u2019s own equity instrument would remain outstanding and the market participant**\n**transferee would take on the rights and responsibilities associated with the instrument. The**\n**instrument would not be cancelled or otherwise extinguished on the measurement date.**  \n35 Even when there is no observable market to provide pricing information about the transfer of a liability or\nan entity\u2019s own equity instrument (eg because contractual or other legal restrictions prevent the transfer of\nsuch items), there might be an observable market for such items if they are held by other parties as assets\n(eg a corporate bond or a call option on an entity\u2019s shares).  \n36 In all cases, an entity shall maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of\nunobservable inputs to meet the objective of a fair value measurement, which is to estimate the price at\nwhich an orderly transaction to transfer the liability or equity instrument would take place between market\nparticipants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  \n_Liabilities and equity instruments held by other parties as assets_  \n**37** **When a quoted price for the transfer of an identical or a similar liability or entity\u2019s own equity**\n**instrument is not available and the identical item is held by another party as an asset, an entity shall**\n**measure the fair value of the liability or equity instrument from the perspective of a market**\n**participant that holds the identical item as an asset at the measurement date.**  \n38 In such cases, an entity shall measure the fair value of the liability or equity instrument as follows:  \n(a) using the quoted price in an active market for the identical item held by another party as an asset,\nif that price is available.  \n(b) if that price is not available, using other observable inputs, such as the quoted price in a market\nthat is not active for the identical item held by another party as an asset.  \n(c) if the observable prices in (a) and (b) are not available, using another valuation technique, such\nas:  \n(i) an _income approach (eg a present value technique that takes into account the future_\ncash flows that a market participant would expect to receive from holding the liability\nor equity instrument as an asset; see paragraphs B10 and B11).  \n(ii) a market approach (eg using quoted prices for similar liabilities or equity instruments\nheld by other parties as assets; see paragraphs B5\u2013B7).  \n39 An entity shall adjust the quoted price of a liability or an entity\u2019s own equity instrument held by another\nparty as an asset only if there are factors specific to the asset that are not applicable to the fair value\nmeasurement of the liability or equity instrument. An entity shall ensure that the price of the asset does not\nreflect the effect of a restriction preventing the sale of that asset. Some factors that may indicate that the\nquoted price of the asset should be adjusted include the following:  \n-----  (a) The quoted price for the asset relates to a similar (but not identical) liability or equity instrument\nheld by another party as an asset. For example, the liability or equity instrument may have a\nparticular characteristic (eg the credit quality of the issuer) that is different from that reflected in\nthe fair value of the similar liability or equity instrument held as an asset.  \n(b) The unit of account for the asset is not the same as for the liability or equity instrument. For\nexample, for liabilities, in some cases the price for an asset reflects a combined price for a\npackage comprising both the amounts due from the issuer and a third-party credit enhancement. If\nthe unit of account for the liability is not for the combined package, the objective is to measure\nthe fair value of the issuer\u2019s liability, not the fair value of the combined package. Thus, in such\ncases, the entity would adjust the observed price for the asset to exclude the effect of the thirdparty credit enhancement.  \n_Liabilities and equity instruments not held by other parties as assets_  \n**40** **When a quoted price for the transfer of an identical or a similar liability or entity\u2019s own equity**\n**instrument is not available and the identical item is not held by another party as an asset, an entity**\n**shall measure the fair value of the liability or equity instrument using a valuation technique from the**\n**perspective of a market participant that owes the liability or has issued the claim on equity.**  \n41 For example, when applying a present value technique an entity might take into account either of the\nfollowing:  \n(a) the future cash outflows that a market participant would expect to incur in fulfilling the\nobligation, including the compensation that a market participant would require for taking on the\nobligation (see paragraphs B31\u2013B33).  \n(b) the amount that a market participant would receive to enter into or issue an identical liability or\nequity instrument, using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the\nidentical item (eg having the same credit characteristics) in the principal (or most advantageous)\nmarket for issuing a liability or an equity instrument with the same contractual terms.",

If the entity\nmanages that group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of its net exposure to either\nmarket risks or credit risk, the entity is permitted to apply an exception to this Standard for measuring fair\nvalue. That exception permits an entity to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial\nliabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position (ie an asset) for a\nparticular risk exposure or paid to transfer a net short position (ie a liability) for a particular risk exposure in\nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market\nconditions. Accordingly, an entity shall measure the fair value of the group of financial assets and financial\nliabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement\ndate.  \n49 An entity is permitted to use the exception in paragraph 48 only if the entity does all the following:  \n(a) manages the group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the entity\u2019s net\nexposure to a particular market risk (or risks) or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty in\naccordance with the entity\u2019s documented risk management or investment strategy;  \n(b) provides information on that basis about the group of financial assets and financial liabilities to\nthe entity\u2019s key management personnel, as defined in AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures; and  \n(c) is required or has elected to measure those financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value in\nthe statement of financial position at the end of each reporting period.  \n50 The exception in paragraph 48 does not pertain to financial statement presentation. In some cases the basis\nfor the presentation of financial instruments in the statement of financial position differs from the basis for\nthe measurement of financial instruments, for example, if a Standard does not require or permit financial\ninstruments to be presented on a net basis. In such cases an entity may need to allocate the portfolio-level\nadjustments (see paragraphs 53\u201356) to the individual assets or liabilities that make up the group of financial\nassets and financial liabilities managed on the basis of the entity\u2019s net risk exposure.

Three widely used valuation techniques are the market approach, the cost\n_approach and the income approach. The main aspects of those approaches are summarised in paragraphs_\nB5\u2013B11. An entity shall use valuation techniques consistent with one or more of those approaches to\nmeasure fair value.  \n63 In some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate (eg when valuing an asset or a liability using\nquoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities). In other cases, multiple valuation\ntechniques will be appropriate (eg that might be the case when valuing a cash-generating unit). If multiple\nvaluation techniques are used to measure fair value, the results (ie respective indications of fair value) shall\nbe evaluated considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated by those results. A fair value\nmeasurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.  \n64 If the transaction price is fair value at initial recognition and a valuation technique that uses unobservable\ninputs will be used to measure fair value in subsequent periods, the valuation technique shall be calibrated  \n-----  so that at initial recognition the result of the valuation technique equals the transaction price. Calibration\nensures that the valuation technique reflects current market conditions, and it helps an entity to determine\nwhether an adjustment to the valuation technique is necessary (eg there might be a characteristic of the asset\nor liability that is not captured by the valuation technique). After initial recognition, when measuring fair\nvalue using a valuation technique or techniques that use unobservable inputs, an entity shall ensure that\nthose valuation techniques reflect observable market data (eg the price for a similar asset or liability) at the\nmeasurement date.  \n65 Valuation techniques used to measure fair value shall be applied consistently. However, a change in a\nvaluation technique or its application (eg a change in its weighting when multiple valuation techniques are\nused or a change in an adjustment applied to a valuation technique) is appropriate if the change results in a\nmeasurement that is equally or more representative of fair value in the circumstances. That might be the\ncase if, for example, any of the following events take place:  \n(a) new markets develop;  \n(b) new information becomes available;  \n(c) information previously used is no longer available;  \n(d) valuation techniques improve; or  \n(e) market conditions change.  \n66 Revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application shall be accounted for as a\nchange in accounting estimate in accordance with AASB 108. However, the disclosures in AASB 108 for a\nchange in accounting estimate are not required for revisions resulting from a change in a valuation\ntechnique or its application.",

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted\nprices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).  \n73 In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorised in its\nentirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire\nmeasurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the entire measurement requires judgement,\ntaking into account factors specific to the asset or liability. Adjustments to arrive at measurements based on\nfair value, such as costs to sell when measuring fair value less costs to sell, shall not be taken into account\nwhen determining the level of the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised.  \n74 The availability of relevant inputs and their relative subjectivity might affect the selection of appropriate\nvaluation techniques (see paragraph 61). However, the fair value hierarchy prioritises the inputs to valuation\ntechniques, not the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.

Therefore, the emphasis within Level 1 is\non determining both of the following:  \n(a) the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability; and  \n(b) whether the entity can enter into a transaction for the asset or liability at the price in that market at\nthe measurement date.  \n79 An entity shall not make an adjustment to a Level 1 input except in the following circumstances:  \n(a) when an entity holds a large number of similar (but not identical) assets or liabilities (eg debt\nsecurities) that are measured at fair value and a quoted price in an active market is available but\nnot readily accessible for each of those assets or liabilities individually (ie given the large number\nof similar assets or liabilities held by the entity, it would be difficult to obtain pricing information\nfor each individual asset or liability at the measurement date). In that case, as a practical\nexpedient, an entity may measure fair value using an alternative pricing method that does not rely\nexclusively on quoted prices (eg matrix pricing). However, the use of an alternative pricing\nmethod results in a fair value measurement categorised within a lower level of the fair value\nhierarchy.  \n(b) when a quoted price in an active market does not represent fair value at the measurement date.\nThat might be the case if, for example, significant events (such as transactions in a principal-toprincipal market, trades in a brokered market or announcements) take place after the close of a\nmarket but before the measurement date. An entity shall establish and consistently apply a policy\nfor identifying those events that might affect fair value measurements.

If no adjustment to the\nquoted price of the asset is required, the result is a fair value measurement categorised within\nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. However, any adjustment to the quoted price of the asset\nresults in a fair value measurement categorised within a lower level of the fair value hierarchy.  \n80 If an entity holds a position in a single asset or liability (including a position comprising a large number of\nidentical assets or liabilities, such as a holding of financial instruments) and the asset or liability is traded in\nan active market, the fair value of the asset or liability shall be measured within Level 1 as the product of\nthe quoted price for the individual asset or liability and the quantity held by the entity. That is the case even\nif a market\u2019s normal daily trading volume is not sufficient to absorb the quantity held and placing orders to\nsell the position in a single transaction might affect the quoted price.",

Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use\nwhen pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.  \n88 Assumptions about risk include the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair\nvalue (such as a pricing model) and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. A\nmeasurement that does not include an adjustment for risk would not represent a fair value measurement if\nmarket participants would include one when pricing the asset or liability. For example, it might be\nnecessary to include a risk adjustment when there is significant measurement uncertainty (eg when there has\nbeen a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity when compared with normal market activity\nfor the asset or liability, or similar assets or liabilities, and the entity has determined that the transaction\nprice or quoted price does not represent fair value, as described in paragraphs B37\u2013B47).  \n-----  89 An entity shall develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances,\nwhich might include the entity\u2019s own data.

An entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to\nobtain information about market participant assumptions. However, an entity shall take into account all\ninformation about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available.

Recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those that other\nAustralian Accounting Standards require or permit in the statement of financial position at the\nend of each reporting period. Non-recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are\nthose that other Australian Accounting Standards require or permit in the statement of financial\nposition in particular circumstances (eg when an entity measures an asset held for sale at fair\nvalue less costs to sell in accordance with AASB 5 _Non-current Assets Held for Sale and_\n_Discontinued Operations because the asset\u2019s fair value less costs to sell is lower than its carrying_\namount).  \n(b) for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, the level of the fair value hierarchy\nwithin which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety (Level 1, 2 or 3).  \n(c) for assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, the amounts of any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy, the reasons for those transfers and the entity\u2019s policy for determining when transfers\nbetween levels are deemed to have occurred (see paragraph 95). Transfers into each level shall be\ndisclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level.  \n(d) for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 2 and Level 3\nof the fair value hierarchy, a description of the valuation technique(s) and the inputs used in the\nfair value measurement. If there has been a change in valuation technique (eg changing from a\nmarket approach to an income approach or the use of an additional valuation technique), the\nentity shall disclose that change and the reason(s) for making it. For fair value measurements\ncategorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, an entity shall provide quantitative  \n-----  information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement. An\nentity is not required to create quantitative information to comply with this disclosure\nrequirement if quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed by the entity when measuring\nfair value (eg when an entity uses prices from prior transactions or third-party pricing information\nwithout adjustment). However, when providing this disclosure an entity cannot ignore\nquantitative unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are\nreasonably available to the entity.  \n(e) for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a\nreconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances, disclosing separately changes\nduring the period attributable to the following:  \n(i) total gains or losses for the period recognised in profit or loss, and the line item(s) in\nprofit or loss in which those gains or losses are recognised.  \n(ii) total gains or losses for the period recognised in other comprehensive income, and the\nline item(s) in other comprehensive income in which those gains or losses are\nrecognised.  \n(iii) purchases, sales, issues and settlements (each of those types of changes disclosed\nseparately).  \n(iv) the amounts of any transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the\nreasons for those transfers and the entity\u2019s policy for determining when transfers\nbetween levels are deemed to have occurred (see paragraph 95). Transfers into Level 3\nshall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of Level 3.  \n(f) for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the\namount of the total gains or losses for the period in (e)(i) included in profit or loss that is\nattributable to the change in unrealised gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities held\nat the end of the reporting period, and the line item(s) in profit or loss in which those unrealised\ngains or losses are recognised.  \n(g) for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, a description of the valuation processes used by the entity (including, for\nexample, how an entity decides its valuation policies and procedures and analyses changes in fair\nvalue measurements from period to period).  \n(h) for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:  \n(i) for all such measurements, a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value\nmeasurement to changes in unobservable inputs if a change in those inputs to a\ndifferent amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.\nIf there are interrelationships between those inputs and other unobservable inputs used\nin the fair value measurement, an entity shall also provide a description of those\ninterrelationships and of how they might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in\nthe unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement. To comply with that disclosure\nrequirement, the narrative description of the sensitivity to changes in unobservable\ninputs shall include, at a minimum, the unobservable inputs disclosed when complying\nwith (d).  \n(ii) for financial assets and financial liabilities, if changing one or more of the unobservable\ninputs to reflect reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change fair value\nsignificantly, an entity shall state that fact and disclose the effect of those changes. The\nentity shall disclose how the effect of a change to reflect a reasonably possible\nalternative assumption was calculated. For that purpose, significance shall be judged\nwith respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities, or, when changes in fair\nvalue are recognised in other comprehensive income, total equity.  \n(i) for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, if the highest and best use of a nonfinancial asset differs from its current use, an entity shall disclose that fact and why the nonfinancial asset is being used in a manner that differs from its highest and best use.  \nAus93.1 Notwithstanding paragraph 93, in respect of not-for-profit public sector entities, for assets within\nthe scope of AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment for which the future economic benefits\nare not primarily dependent on the asset\u2019s ability to generate net cash inflows, the following\nrequirements do not apply:  \n(a) in paragraph 93(d), the text \u201cFor fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, an entity shall provide quantitative information about the  \n-----  significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement. An entity is not\nrequired to create quantitative information to comply with this disclosure requirement\nif quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed by the entity when measuring fair\nvalue (eg when an entity uses prices from prior transactions or third-party pricing\ninformation without adjustment). However, when providing this disclosure an entity\ncannot ignore quantitative unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value\nmeasurement and are reasonably available to the entity.\u201d;  \n(b) paragraph 93(f); and  \n(c) paragraph 93(h)(i).  \nAus93.2 For a non-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held primarily for its ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows, the information in paragraph 93(i) is required to be disclosed only if\nthe entity has determined that the asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use. Such an\nentity is required to consider whether this difference exists only when, in accordance with\nparagraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2, at the measurement date, the asset is classified as held for sale\nor held for distribution to owners in accordance with AASB 5 or it is highly probable that the\nasset will be used for an alternative purpose to its current use.  \n94 An entity shall determine appropriate classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the following:  \n(a) the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability; and  \n(b) the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised.  \nThe number of classes may need to be greater for fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy because those measurements have a greater degree of uncertainty and subjectivity.\nDetermining appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value\nmeasurements should be provided requires judgement. A class of assets and liabilities will often require\ngreater disaggregation than the line items presented in the statement of financial position. However, an\nentity shall provide information sufficient to permit reconciliation to the line items presented in the\nstatement of financial position. If another Standard specifies the class for an asset or a liability, an entity\nmay use that class in providing the disclosures required in this Standard if that class meets the requirements\nin this paragraph.  \n95 An entity shall disclose and consistently follow its policy for determining when transfers between levels of\nthe fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred in accordance with paragraph 93(c) and (e)(iv). The\npolicy about the timing of recognising transfers shall be the same for transfers into the levels as for transfers\nout of the levels. Examples of policies for determining the timing of transfers include the following:  \n(a) the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.  \n(b) the beginning of the reporting period.  \n(c) the end of the reporting period.  \n96 If an entity makes an accounting policy decision to use the exception in paragraph 48, it shall disclose that\nfact.  \n97 For each class of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but\nfor which the fair value is disclosed, an entity shall disclose the information required by paragraph 93(b),\n(d) and (i). However, an entity is not required to provide the quantitative disclosures about significant\nunobservable inputs used in fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nrequired by paragraph 93(d). For such assets and liabilities, an entity does not need to provide the other\ndisclosures required by this Standard.  \n98 For a liability measured at fair value and issued with an inseparable third-party credit enhancement, an\nissuer shall disclose the existence of that credit enhancement and whether it is reflected in the fair value\nmeasurement of the liability.  \n99 An entity shall present the quantitative disclosures required by this Standard in a tabular format unless\nanother format is more appropriate.",

For example:  \n(a) the fair value of the asset might be the same whether the asset is used on a stand-alone basis or in\ncombination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities. That might be the case if the\nasset is a business that market participants would continue to operate. In that case, the transaction\nwould involve valuing the business in its entirety. The use of the assets as a group in an ongoing\nbusiness would generate synergies that would be available to market participants (ie market\nparticipant synergies that, therefore, should affect the fair value of the asset on either a standalone basis or in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities).  \n(b) an asset\u2019s use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities might be\nincorporated into the fair value measurement through adjustments to the value of the asset used\non a stand-alone basis That might be the case if the asset is a machine and the fair value\nmeasurement is determined using an observed price for a similar machine (not installed or\notherwise configured for use), adjusted for transport and installation costs so that the fair value\nmeasurement reflects the current condition and location of the machine (installed and configured\nfor use).  \n(c) an asset\u2019s use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities might be\nincorporated into the fair value measurement through the market participant assumptions used to\nmeasure the fair value of the asset. For example, if the asset is work in progress inventory that is\nunique and market participants would convert the inventory into finished goods, the fair value of\nthe inventory would assume that market participants have acquired or would acquire any\nspecialised machinery necessary to convert the inventory into finished goods.  \n(d) an asset\u2019s use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities might be\nincorporated into the valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the asset. That might\nbe the case when using the multi-period excess earnings method to measure the fair value of an\nintangible asset because that valuation technique specifically takes into account the contribution\nof any complementary assets and the associated liabilities in the group in which such an\nintangible asset would be used.  \n-----  (e) in more limited situations, when an entity uses an asset within a group of assets, the entity might\nmeasure the asset at an amount that approximates its fair value when allocating the fair value of\nthe asset group to the individual assets of the group. That might be the case if the valuation\ninvolves real property and the fair value of improved property (ie an asset group) is allocated to\nits component assets (such as land and improvements).",

        "page_content=": "### The components of a present value measurement\nB13 Present value (ie an application of the income approach) is a tool used to link future amounts (eg cash flows\nor values) to a present amount using a discount rate. A fair value measurement of an asset or a liability\nusing a present value technique captures all the following elements from the perspective of market\nparticipants at the measurement date:  \n(a) an estimate of future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured.  \n(b) expectations about possible variations in the amount and timing of the cash flows representing the\nuncertainty inherent in the cash flows.  \n(c) the time value of money, represented by the rate on risk-free monetary assets that have maturity\ndates or durations that coincide with the period covered by the cash flows and pose neither\nuncertainty in timing nor risk of default to the holder (ie a risk-free interest rate).  \n(d) the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows (ie a risk premium).  \n(e) other factors that market participants would take into account in the circumstances.  \n(f) for a liability, the non-performance risk relating to that liability, including the entity\u2019s (ie the\nobligor\u2019s) own credit risk.  \n_General principles_  \nB14 Present value techniques differ in how they capture the elements in paragraph B13. However, all the\nfollowing general principles govern the application of any present value technique used to measure fair\nvalue:  \n(a) Cash flows and discount rates should reflect assumptions that market participants would use\nwhen pricing the asset or liability.  \n(b) Cash flows and discount rates should take into account only the factors attributable to the asset or\nliability being measured.  \n(c) To avoid double-counting or omitting the effects of risk factors, discount rates should reflect\nassumptions that are consistent with those inherent in the cash flows. For example, a discount rate\nthat reflects the uncertainty in expectations about future defaults is appropriate if using\ncontractual cash flows of a loan (ie a discount rate adjustment technique). That same rate should\nnot be used if using expected (ie probability-weighted) cash flows (ie an expected present value\ntechnique) because the expected cash flows already reflect assumptions about the uncertainty in  \n-----  future defaults; instead, a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the\nexpected cash flows should be used.  \n(d) Assumptions about cash flows and discount rates should be internally consistent. For example,\nnominal cash flows, which include the effect of inflation, should be discounted at a rate that\nincludes the effect of inflation. The nominal risk-free interest rate includes the effect of inflation.\nReal cash flows, which exclude the effect of inflation, should be discounted at a rate that excludes\nthe effect of inflation. Similarly, after-tax cash flows should be discounted using an after-tax\ndiscount rate. Pre-tax cash flows should be discounted at a rate consistent with those cash flows.  \n(e) Discount rates should be consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in\nwhich the cash flows are denominated.  \n_Risk and uncertainty_  \nB15 A fair value measurement using present value techniques is made under conditions of uncertainty because\nthe cash flows used are estimates rather than known amounts. In many cases both the amount and timing of\nthe cash flows are uncertain. Even contractually fixed amounts, such as the payments on a loan, are\nuncertain if there is risk of default.  \nB16 Market participants generally seek compensation (ie a risk premium) for bearing the uncertainty inherent in\nthe cash flows of an asset or a liability. A fair value measurement should include a risk premium reflecting\nthe amount that market participants would demand as compensation for the uncertainty inherent in the cash\nflows. Otherwise, the measurement would not faithfully represent fair value. In some cases determining the\nappropriate risk premium might be difficult. However, the degree of difficulty alone is not a sufficient\nreason to exclude a risk premium.  \nB17 Present value techniques differ in how they adjust for risk and in the type of cash flows they use. For\nexample:  \n(a) The discount rate adjustment technique (see paragraphs B18\u2013B22) uses a risk-adjusted discount\nrate and contractual, promised or most likely cash flows.  \n(b) Method 1 of the expected present value technique (see paragraph B25) uses risk-adjusted\nexpected cash flows and a risk-free rate.  \n(c) Method 2 of the expected present value technique (see paragraph B26) uses expected cash flows\nthat are not risk-adjusted and a discount rate adjusted to include the risk premium that market\nparticipants require. That rate is different from the rate used in the discount rate adjustment\ntechnique.  \n_Discount rate adjustment technique_  \nB18 The discount rate adjustment technique uses a single set of cash flows from the range of possible estimated\namounts, whether contractual or promised (as is the case for a bond) or most likely cash flows. In all cases,\nthose cash flows are conditional upon the occurrence of specified events (eg contractual or promised cash\nflows for a bond are conditional on the event of no default by the debtor). The discount rate used in the\ndiscount rate adjustment technique is derived from observed rates of return for comparable assets or\nliabilities that are traded in the market. Accordingly, the contractual, promised or most likely cash flows are\ndiscounted at an observed or estimated market rate for such conditional cash flows (ie a market rate of\nreturn).  \nB19 The discount rate adjustment technique requires an analysis of market data for comparable assets or\nliabilities. Comparability is established by considering the nature of the cash flows (eg whether the cash\nflows are contractual or non-contractual and are likely to respond similarly to changes in economic\nconditions), as well as other factors (eg credit standing, collateral, duration, restrictive covenants and\nliquidity). Alternatively, if a single comparable asset or liability does not fairly reflect the risk inherent in\nthe cash flows of the asset or liability being measured, it may be possible to derive a discount rate using\ndata for several comparable assets or liabilities in conjunction with the risk-free yield curve (ie using a\n\u2018build-up\u2019 approach).  \nB20 To illustrate a build-up approach, assume that Asset A is a contractual right to receive CU800[1] in one year\n(ie there is no timing uncertainty). There is an established market for comparable assets, and information\nabout those assets, including price information, is available. Of those comparable assets:  \n1 In this Standard monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units (CU)\u2019.  \n-----  (a) Asset B is a contractual right to receive CU1,200 in one year and has a market price of CU1,083.\nThus, the implied annual rate of return (ie a one-year market rate of return) is 10.8 per cent  \n[(CU1,200/CU1,083) \u2013 1].  \n(b) Asset C is a contractual right to receive CU700 in two years and has a market price of CU566.\nThus, the implied annual rate of return (ie a two-year market rate of return) is 11.2 per cent  \n[(CU700/CU566)[0.5] \u2013 1].  \n(c) All three assets are comparable with respect to risk (ie dispersion of possible pay-offs and credit).  \nB21 On the basis of the timing of the contractual payments to be received for Asset A relative to the timing for\nAsset B and Asset C (ie one year for Asset B versus two years for Asset C), Asset B is deemed more\ncomparable to Asset A. Using the contractual payment to be received for Asset A (CU800) and the one-year\nmarket rate derived from Asset B (10.8 per cent), the fair value of Asset A is CU722 (CU800/1.108).\nAlternatively, in the absence of available market information for Asset B, the one-year market rate could be\nderived from Asset C using the build-up approach. In that case the two-year market rate indicated by Asset\nC (11.2 per cent) would be adjusted to a one-year market rate using the term structure of the risk-free yield\ncurve. Additional information and analysis might be required to determine whether the risk premiums for\none-year and two-year assets are the same. If it is determined that the risk premiums for one-year and twoyear assets are not the same, the two-year market rate of return would be further adjusted for that effect.  \nB22 When the discount rate adjustment technique is applied to fixed receipts or payments, the adjustment for\nrisk inherent in the cash flows of the asset or liability being measured is included in the discount rate. In\nsome applications of the discount rate adjustment technique to cash flows that are not fixed receipts or\npayments, an adjustment to the cash flows may be necessary to achieve comparability with the observed\nasset or liability from which the discount rate is derived.  \n_Expected present value technique_  \nB23 The expected present value technique uses as a starting point a set of cash flows that represents the\nprobability-weighted average of all possible future cash flows (ie the expected cash flows). The resulting\nestimate is identical to expected value, which, in statistical terms, is the weighted average of a discrete\nrandom variable\u2019s possible values with the respective probabilities as the weights. Because all possible cash\nflows are probability-weighted, the resulting expected cash flow is not conditional upon the occurrence of\nany specified event (unlike the cash flows used in the discount rate adjustment technique).  \nB24 In making an investment decision, risk-averse market participants would take into account the risk that the\nactual cash flows may differ from the expected cash flows. Portfolio theory distinguishes between two types\nof risk:  \n(a) unsystematic (diversifiable) risk, which is the risk specific to a particular asset or liability.  \n(b) systematic (non-diversifiable) risk, which is the common risk shared by an asset or a liability with\nthe other items in a diversified portfolio.  \nPortfolio theory holds that in a market in equilibrium, market participants will be compensated only for\nbearing the systematic risk inherent in the cash flows. (In markets that are inefficient or out of equilibrium,\nother forms of return or compensation might be available.)  \nB25 Method 1 of the expected present value technique adjusts the expected cash flows of an asset for systematic\n(ie market) risk by subtracting a cash risk premium (ie risk-adjusted expected cash flows). Those riskadjusted expected cash flows represent a certainty-equivalent cash flow, which is discounted at a risk-free\ninterest rate. A certainty-equivalent cash flow refers to an expected cash flow (as defined), adjusted for risk\nso that a market participant is indifferent to trading a certain cash flow for an expected cash flow. For\nexample, if a market participant was willing to trade an expected cash flow of CU1,200 for a certain cash\nflow of CU1,000, the CU1,000 is the certainty equivalent of the CU1,200 (ie the CU200 would represent\nthe cash risk premium). In that case the market participant would be indifferent as to the asset held.  \nB26 In contrast, Method 2 of the expected present value technique adjusts for systematic (ie market) risk by\napplying a risk premium to the risk-free interest rate. Accordingly, the expected cash flows are discounted\nat a rate that corresponds to an expected rate associated with probability-weighted cash flows (ie an\nexpected rate of return). Models used for pricing risky assets, such as the capital asset pricing model, can be\nused to estimate the expected rate of return. Because the discount rate used in the discount rate adjustment\ntechnique is a rate of return relating to conditional cash flows, it is likely to be higher than the discount rate\nused in Method 2 of the expected present value technique, which is an expected rate of return relating to\nexpected or probability-weighted cash flows.  \nB27 To illustrate Methods 1 and 2, assume that an asset has expected cash flows of CU780 in one year\ndetermined on the basis of the possible cash flows and probabilities shown below. The applicable risk-free  \n-----  interest rate for cash flows with a one-year horizon is 5 per cent, and the systematic risk premium for an\nasset with the same risk profile is 3 per cent.",

In more realistic situations, there could be many possible outcomes. However,\nto apply the expected present value technique, it is not always necessary to take into account distributions of\nall possible cash flows using complex models and techniques. Rather, it might be possible to develop a\nlimited number of discrete scenarios and probabilities that capture the array of possible cash flows. For\nexample, an entity might use realised cash flows for some relevant past period, adjusted for changes in\ncircumstances occurring subsequently (eg changes in external factors, including economic or market\nconditions, industry trends and competition as well as changes in internal factors affecting the entity more\nspecifically), taking into account the assumptions of market participants.  \nB29 In theory, the present value (ie the fair value) of the asset\u2019s cash flows is the same whether determined using\nMethod 1 or Method 2, as follows:  \n(a) Using Method 1, the expected cash flows are adjusted for systematic (ie market) risk. In the\nabsence of market data directly indicating the amount of the risk adjustment, such adjustment\ncould be derived from an asset pricing model using the concept of certainty equivalents. For\nexample, the risk adjustment (ie the cash risk premium of CU22) could be determined using the\nsystematic risk premium of 3 per cent (CU780 \u2013 [CU780 \u00d7 (1.05/1.08)]), which results in riskadjusted expected cash flows of CU758 (CU780 \u2013 CU22). The CU758 is the certainty equivalent\nof CU780 and is discounted at the risk-free interest rate (5 per cent). The present value (ie the fair\nvalue) of the asset is CU722 (CU758/1.05).  \n(b) Using Method 2, the expected cash flows are not adjusted for systematic (ie market) risk. Rather,\nthe adjustment for that risk is included in the discount rate. Thus, the expected cash flows are\ndiscounted at an expected rate of return of 8 per cent (ie the 5 per cent risk-free interest rate plus\nthe 3 per cent systematic risk premium). The present value (ie the fair value) of the asset is\nCU722 (CU780/1.08).  \nB30 When using an expected present value technique to measure fair value, either Method 1 or Method 2 could\nbe used. The selection of Method 1 or Method 2 will depend on facts and circumstances specific to the asset\nor liability being measured, the extent to which sufficient data are available and the judgements applied.",

To determine whether, on the basis of the evidence available, there\nhas been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability, an entity shall\nevaluate the significance and relevance of factors such as the following:  \n(a) There are few recent transactions.  \n(b) Price quotations are not developed using current information.  \n(c) Price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market-makers (eg some brokered\nmarkets).  \n(d) Indices that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are\ndemonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability.  \n(e) There is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields or performance\nindicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices\nwhen compared with the entity\u2019s estimate of expected cash flows, taking into account all\navailable market data about credit and other non-performance risk for the asset or liability.  \n(f) There is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread.  \n(g) There is a significant decline in the activity of, or there is an absence of, a market for new issues\n(ie a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities.  \n(h) Little information is publicly available (eg for transactions that take place in a principal-toprincipal market).  \nB38 If an entity concludes that there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the\nasset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities),\nfurther analysis of the transactions or quoted prices is needed. A decrease in the volume or level of activity\non its own may not indicate that a transaction price or quoted price does not represent fair value or that a\ntransaction in that market is not orderly. However, if an entity determines that a transaction or quoted price\ndoes not represent fair value (eg there may be transactions that are not orderly), an adjustment to the\ntransactions or quoted prices will be necessary if the entity uses those prices as a basis for measuring fair\nvalue and that adjustment may be significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Adjustments also\nmay be necessary in other circumstances (eg when a price for a similar asset requires significant adjustment\nto make it comparable to the asset being measured or when the price is stale).  \nB39 This Standard does not prescribe a methodology for making significant adjustments to transactions or\nquoted prices. See paragraphs 61\u201366 and B5\u2013B11 for a discussion of the use of valuation techniques when\nmeasuring fair value. Regardless of the valuation technique used, an entity shall include appropriate risk\nadjustments, including a risk premium reflecting the amount that market participants would demand as\ncompensation for the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows of an asset or a liability (see paragraph B17).\nOtherwise, the measurement does not faithfully represent fair value. In some cases determining the\nappropriate risk adjustment might be difficult. However, the degree of difficulty alone is not a sufficient\nbasis on which to exclude a risk adjustment. The risk adjustment shall be reflective of an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  \nB40 If there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability, a change\nin valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate (eg the use of a\nmarket approach and a present value technique). When weighting indications of fair value resulting from\nthe use of multiple valuation techniques, an entity shall consider the reasonableness of the range of fair\nvalue measurements. The objective is to determine the point within the range that is most representative of\nfair value under current market conditions. A wide range of fair value measurements may be an indication\nthat further analysis is needed.  \nB41 Even when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability,\nthe objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair value is the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (ie not a forced liquidation or distress\nsale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  \nB42 Estimating the price at which market participants would be willing to enter into a transaction at the\nmeasurement date under current market conditions if there has been a significant decrease in the volume or\nlevel of activity for the asset or liability depends on the facts and circumstances at the measurement date\nand requires judgement. An entity\u2019s intention to hold the asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil the liability is  \n-----  not relevant when measuring fair value because fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entityspecific measurement.",

In such circumstances it is not appropriate to\nconclude that all transactions in that market are not orderly (ie forced liquidations or distress sales).\nCircumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly include the following:  \n(a) There was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow\nfor marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or\nliabilities under current market conditions.  \n(b) There was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to\na single market participant.  \n(c) The seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (ie the seller is distressed).  \n(d) The seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (ie the seller was forced).  \n(e) The transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or a\nsimilar asset or liability.  \nAn entity shall evaluate the circumstances to determine whether, on the weight of the evidence available,\nthe transaction is orderly.  \nB44 An entity shall consider all the following when measuring fair value or estimating market risk premiums:  \n(a) If the evidence indicates that a transaction is not orderly, an entity shall place little, if any, weight\n(compared with other indications of fair value) on that transaction price.  \n(b) If the evidence indicates that a transaction is orderly, an entity shall take into account that\ntransaction price.

Paragraph 23 states that, in developing those assumptions, an entity need not identify specific\nmarket participants.  \nF3 Unobservable inputs are defined as inputs for which market data are not available and that are developed\nusing the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing\nthe asset or liability. Paragraph 87 states that unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the\nextent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is\nlittle, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Paragraph 89 states that, in\ndeveloping unobservable inputs, an entity:  \n(a) may begin with its own data, but it shall adjust those data if reasonably available information\nindicates that other market participants would use different data or there is something particular to\nthe entity that is not available to other market participants (eg an entity-specific synergy); and  \n(b) need not undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions.  \nF4 Various non-financial assets of not-for-profit public sector entities not held primarily for their ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows, especially some that are specialised, do not have observable market selling prices\nor other observable market data because entities seldom sell those assets until their economic life has\nexpired (ie there is little market activity for the asset or comparable assets at the measurement date).\nConsequently, in applying the requirement of paragraph 61 for fair value estimates to maximise the use of\nrelevant observable inputs, it may nonetheless be necessary to develop unobservable inputs to estimate their\nfair value. Moreover, for assets that are unique to a government, observable evidence of assumptions of\nother market participants, if any, is unlikely to differ from the entity\u2019s own assumptions.  \nF5 Accordingly, when applying the principles in paragraphs 61 and 62 to measure the fair value of a nonfinancial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash\ninflows, if both the market selling price of a comparable asset and some market participant data required to\nmeasure the fair value of the asset are not observable, the entity shall use its own assumptions as a starting\npoint in developing unobservable inputs and adjust those assumptions to the extent that reasonably available\ninformation indicates that other market participants (including, but not limited to, other not-for-profit public\nsector entities) would use different data.  \nF6 For the purposes of paragraph F5, exhaustive efforts need not be undertaken to identify whether relevant\ninformation about other market participant assumptions is reasonably available or whether the entity\u2019s own\ndata should be adjusted. However, when information about market participant assumptions is reasonably\navailable, an entity cannot ignore that information. To the extent that relevant information about other\nmarket participant assumptions is not reasonably available, the entity shall use its own assumptions in\nmeasuring the fair value of the asset.  \n-----  F7 For the purposes of paragraphs F5 and F6, for assets with various inputs to their fair value estimate,\nobservable market data might be reasonably available for some inputs, in which instances unobservable\ninputs would be used for the remainder of the asset\u2019s fair value estimate. For example, the land component\nof a self-constructed specialised facility might have comparable land with an observable market price, but\nentity-specific data might be needed to measure the fair value of some or all of the improvements on that\nland included in the fair value estimate for the facility.",

In this\nexample, based on these assumed facts alone (for simplicity), the school buildings\u2019 gross replacement cost\nwould be based on the school\u2019s needed capacity (for 100 students), from which any other accumulated\nobsolescence related to the condition of the school buildings (eg physical obsolescence) would be deducted.\nConsistent with paragraph F16, the conclusion reached would not depend on whether a formal decision has\nbeen made to reduce the school buildings\u2019 capacity.  \nF19 Where an asset or a facility that is not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows suffers a\nsignificant reduction in demand for its services, any economic obsolescence identified would not necessarily\n(and frequently would not) exhibit a linear relationship with that reduced level of demand. This is due to\neconomies of scale causing some parts of an asset or a facility potentially needing replacement in full, or\nalmost in full, despite a significant fall in demand for the services provided by the asset or facility, in which\ncase the needed physical capacity of the asset or facility would not reduce linearly with the reduction in the\nlevel of demand for that asset\u2019s or facility\u2019s services. In the school example in paragraph F18, the\nadministration office, canteen, toilet blocks, library and gymnasium might need replacing even for 100\nstudents, although perhaps on a slightly smaller scale.  \n-----  ",

It measures the fair value\nof its roads using the cost approach. This example illustrates the consideration of the costs to include in\nthe gross replacement cost of a reference road. The measurement of accumulated obsolescence and the\nvaluation of land are not addressed in this example.  \nAs at 30 June 20X2, Council A controls a particular road (the subject road). In the process of using the\ncost approach to measure the fair value of the road, Council A determines which costs to include in the\nreplacement cost of a reference road.  \nThe costs in the list below, measured using prices as at that measurement date, relate to the reference\nroad. For simplicity, in this example, it is assumed that the replacement of the reference road would occur\nwithin a year and, consequently, in the current market environment, material financing costs (from the\nperspective of the market participant) would not be incurred in replacing the reference road.  \nCosts (excluding costs to remove unwanted existing Estimated cost\nstructures and disruption costs: see below) as at 30 June 20X2  \n_$\u2019000_  \nDesign work 2,200  \nEarthworks 10,000  \nFormation 5,000  \nPavement 3,000  \nSurfacing 2,000  \nTotal 22,200  \n-----  The following two types of costs also relate to the reference road as at 30 June 20X2.  \nCosts to remove unwanted existing structures and disruption costs  \nCouncil A\u2019s road is situated in a densely populated area, and Council A assesses that, since there is no\nvacant site in the surrounding area as at 30 June 20X2, to construct a road in a hypothetical acquisition, a\nmarket participant buyer would need to incur $2,000,000 to remove unwanted structures on the land to\nmake way for the construction of the road. Council A did not reflect any land improvement or\nremediation costs in the fair value of the land under the road.  \nIn addition, because the construction work to replace the subject road at the measurement date would\nrequire interruption of power and water supplies, Council A assumes that the majority of that construction\nwork would occur at night-time to minimise disruption to the community. Council A estimates that, if\nthat work were performed mainly at night-time, it would cost $1,000,000 as at 30 June 20X2. In contrast,\nif those construction works were performed during the daytime, Council A estimates that those costs\nwould reduce to $500,000 as at 30 June 20X2. Council A determined that there is no reasonably available\ninformation indicating that another market participant would construct a road at the location of the\nCouncil\u2019s road during the daytime.",

This is\nbecause the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute road of comparable\nutility at the subject road\u2019s existing location would include each of those costs, including any intrinsically\nlinked disruption costs (eg traffic control and detour costs).  \n_Costs of removal and disposal of unwanted existing structures_  \nIn addition, Council A includes the estimated costs of removal and disposal of unwanted existing\nstructures at $2,000,000 as at 30 June 20X2 in the reference road\u2019s replacement cost. This is because it is\nreasonable to expect that a market participant buyer would need to incur such costs if it was to construct a\nsubstitute road at the subject road\u2019s existing location, since there is no vacant land available in the area.  \n_Disruption costs_  \nSince there is no reasonably available information indicating that another market participant would\nconstruct a road at the location of the Council\u2019s road during the daytime, Council A uses the more costly\nnight-time disruption costs of $1,000,000 in its estimated replacement cost of the reference road as at 30\nJune 20X2 rather than the lower daytime costs.  \nConsequently, Council A measures the gross replacement cost of the reference road as at 30 June 20X2 as\n$25,200,000 (ie $22,200,000 + $2,000,000 + $1,000,000).  \n**Example 2 \u2013 Difference in the asset\u2019s operating environment affecting the reference asset\u2019s gross**\n**replacement cost**  \nA local government (Council B) applies the revaluation model after recognition of each class of property,\nplant and equipment, as referred to in paragraph 31 of AASB 116.  \nCouncil B recognises buildings and land under buildings as separate classes of assets.

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC1 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board\u2019s considerations in\nreaching the conclusions in the Amending Standard. Individual Board members gave greater weight to\nsome factors than to others.  \nBC2 AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January_\n2013. In 2014, the Board received feedback about AASB 13 from not-for-profit public sector entities\nfollowing their implementation of the Standard, including feedback about some of the specified disclosures.\nThese constituents were concerned that the costs of presenting the disclosures specified by the Standard,\nincluding potential disclosure overload for users of not-for-profit public sector general purpose financial\nstatements, exceeded their benefits. The Board noted that it had considered similar issues in 2011 when\nmaking AASB 13, and had decided that no amendment to AASB 13 was necessary. However, following\nthe feedback received, the Board decided, as a narrow scope project, to revisit whether some disclosure\nrelief should be made available to not-for-profit public sector entities.  \nBC3 The Board undertook targeted outreach in late 2014 to further understand which disclosures were of\nconcern to not-for-profit public sector entities, in particular, local governments, and the reasons for their\nconcern. The Board\u2019s outreach activity included feedback from government entities, valuation experts and\nauditors. The Board received mixed feedback as to whether disclosure relief was necessary at this time.  \nBC4 In December 2014, the Board decided to limit its consideration of disclosure relief to:  \n(a) assets within the scope of AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment that are primarily held for\ntheir current service potential (for example, roads and water supply infrastructure) rather than to\ngenerate future net cash inflows; and  \n(b) disclosures in AASB 13 that apply solely to fair value measurements categorised within Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy. These disclosures help meet the objective noted in paragraph 91(b) of\nthe Standard of providing users with information as to how fair value measurements using\nsignificant unobservable inputs affected profit or loss or other comprehensive income for the\nperiod, by requiring disclosure of information about the relative subjectivity of the fair value\nmeasurement.  \nBC5 The Board concluded that the feedback received did not suggest that a wider project scope was necessary to\naddress matters raised about fair value disclosures (see also paragraphs BC7, BC18 and BC19). In April\n2015, the Board evaluated these disclosures against its _Process for Modifying IFRSs for PBE/NFP_\n_(\u2018Process\u2019). The_ _Process allows for departures from the requirements of the equivalent International_\nFinancial Reporting Standard (IFRS) where not-for-profit specific reasons for the departure exist. The\nBoard concluded that, for the interim, in relation to these assets, it is appropriate to depart from its policy of\ntransaction neutrality for cost-benefit reasons in relation to certain disclosures specified by the Standard.  \nBC6 The Board issued Exposure Draft ED 262 Fair Value Disclosures of Not-for-Profit Public Sector Entities in\nMay 2015. ED 262 exposed for public comment the Board\u2019s proposals to relieve not-for-profit public\nsector entities from certain disclosures specified by AASB 13, including the Board\u2019s rationale for its\nproposals. Following the consultation period, and after considering constituent comments received on the\nExposure Draft, the Board decided to proceed with its proposals to make amendments to AASB 13 to\nrelieve not-for-profit public sector entities from disclosing, for assets within the scope of AASB 116 that are\nprimarily held for their current service potential rather than to generate future net cash inflows:  \n(a) for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the\nfair value measurement;  \n(b) for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the\namount of the total gains and losses for the period included in profit or loss that is attributable to\nthe change in unrealised gains or losses relating to the assets held at the end of the reporting\nperiod, and the line item(s) in profit or loss in which those unrealised gains or losses are\nrecognised; and  \n-----  (c) for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a\nnarrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable\ninputs if a change in those inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or\nlower fair value measurement. Where there are interrelationships between those inputs and other\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, the disclosure of a description of those\ninterrelationships and of how they might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the\nunobservable inputs on the fair value measurement will also not be required.  \nBC7 The Board intends to revisit the relief pending the outcome of related current Board projects, including its\nprojects on the review of the Reduced Disclosure Regime (Tier 2), Australian Reporting Framework, and\nConceptual Framework, to assess the extent to which outcomes from those projects address the factors that\nled to the Board\u2019s decisions noted above. The Board acknowledged that constituents also had other\nconcerns with applying AASB 13, including various measurement concerns. The Board noted that these\nissues were beyond the scope of the current narrow-scope project, but would be considered as part of a\nbroader future Board project.",

        "page_content=": "## Significant issues  \nProperty, plant and equipment held by not-for-profit public sector entities  \nBC8 The Board discussed the prevailing practice in the Australian not-for-profit public sector, compared to other\nsectors, of revaluing property, plant and equipment subsequent to initial measurement and recognition. It\nnoted that assets such as road infrastructure and national parks were typically only held by public sector\nentities, but did not consider the nature of such assets in itself to be a sufficient sector specific differentiator,\nas assets held by private sector entities may similarly vary significantly across entities operating in different\nindustries.  \nBC9 The Board noted that property, plant and equipment is primarily held for the purposes of delivering the notfor-profit entity\u2019s public service objectives rather than being held to generate net cash inflows. The Board\nconsidered whether the relief should be extended to similar assets held by not-for-profit entities in the\nprivate sector. The Board observed that private sector entities, including not-for-profit private sector\nentities, may similarly hold assets other than for the purpose of generating net cash inflows. However,\ngiven the diversity of assets held by not-for-profit public sector entities, the information about assets held\nfor their current service potential was likely to be different from such assets held by private sector entities.  \nBC10 The Board considered the extent and variety of long-lived assets measured on the fair value basis in the\npublic sector and noted the resultant impact on the number of classes of assets determined for the purposes\nof satisfying the disclosure requirements of AASB 13. The Board observed that, in many instances, the\nvaluation technique applied to these assets used unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) and that the assets\nwere predominantly categorised within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the purposes of making the\ndisclosures specified by AASB 13. The Board discussed examples of fair value disclosures made in\npublished financial statements of not-for-profit public sector entities. The Board observed that the reported\nrange of many inputs, for example, the cost per square metre applied in the valuation of heritage buildings\nand the adjustment made to reflect the market-participant restricted use of an asset, varied widely within an\nasset class. The Board noted that this variation is likely to be a function of the number of assets grouped\ninto each class, and that it may be impractical for entities to provide disclosures at a more disaggregated\nlevel.",

        "page_content=": "## Balance of costs and benefits  \nBC11 The Board concluded that it is appropriate to depart from its policy of transaction neutrality for assets\nwithin the scope of AASB 116 that are primarily held for their current service potential rather than to\ngenerate future net cash inflows for cost-benefit reasons. This conclusion takes into account the extent and\nvariety of long-lived assets held by public sector entities measured on the fair value basis and categorised\nwithin Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  \nBC12 As part of its considerations, the Board had regard to the benefits of the disclosures recognised by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in its Basis for Conclusions to IFRS 13 _Fair Value_\n_Measurement. Having regard to its observations in paragraphs BC8-BC10, the Board considered that the_\nrelative costs of requiring not-for-profit public sector entities to disclose quantitative information about the\nsignificant unobservable inputs in fair value measurements of property, plant and equipment that are\ncategorised within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, and the narrative description of the sensitivity of  \n-----  certain fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs, would generally be greater than they are\nfor private sector entities. At the same time, the benefits would not be as great having regard to the number\nof assets leading to a wide range of inputs within each class of assets for which disclosure is made and the\ninformation needs of users for such assets, particularly in the context of the very specialised nature and\nlimited alternative use of the assets. The Board similarly considered the costs of making the disclosure\nspecified by paragraph 93(f) of AASB 13 to exceed the benefits to users of the disclosure, given the relative\nusefulness of the additional information to users of not-for-profit public sector general purpose financial\nstatements.  \nBC13 As part of its consideration of the costs versus the benefits of presenting the disclosures specified by\nparagraphs 93(d), 93(f) and 93(h)(i) of AASB 13, the Board observed that many not-for-profit public sector\nentities had only recently applied AASB 13. The Board discussed whether the concerns raised were\nreflective of underlying costs associated with implementing the Standard in a not-for-profit public sector\nenvironment, or whether the costs were largely transitional in nature. For example, the Board noted that the\nrequirement to disclose a narrative description of the sensitivity of certain fair value measurements to\nunobservable inputs was likely to be transitional as it did not appear to be well understood in practice\ndespite an example of the disclosure being included in the Illustrative Examples accompanying IFRS 13.\nThe Board decided that the relative costs to not-for-profit public sector entities of presenting these\ndisclosures were more than transitional in nature.  \nBC14 The Board also observed that IFRS 13 has not yet been incorporated into International Public Sector\nAccounting Standards (IPSASs) as issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board\n(IPSASB) of the International Federation of Accountants. Accordingly, for not-for-profit public sector\nentities, the extent of the disclosures specified by Australian Accounting Standards of the fair value\nmeasurements of property, plant and equipment held primarily for their current service potential presently\nexceeds those specified under IPSASs. The Board noted that future decisions of the IPSASB on public\nsector measurement and the accounting for heritage and infrastructure assets may prompt a need to revisit\nits present decisions on the costs versus benefits of the relief provided (see also paragraph BC7).  \nBC15 The Board decided that it was not necessary to provide relief to entities from disclosing the reconciliation of\nmovements in each class of assets measured at fair value and categorised within Level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy required by paragraph 93(e) of AASB 13 or the valuation processes used by the entity required by\nparagraph 93(g). The Board decided that these disclosures provided useful information without imposing\nsignificant additional ongoing costs. In particular, the Board considered that the information required to\nprepare the necessary reconciliations was likely in many cases to be available in the underlying accounting\nrecords.  \nBC16 The Board noted that entities would continue to be required to disclose a description of the valuation\ntechnique(s) and the inputs used in the fair value measurement in accordance with paragraph 93(d) of\nAASB 13. The Board expects, in most instances, that this disclosure together with other disclosures\nspecified in AASB 13 and other Australian Accounting Standards (for example, AASB 101 Presentation of\n_Financial Statements and AASB 116), would provide users of not-for-profit public sector general purpose_\nfinancial statements with sufficient information about fair value measurements for decision-making\npurposes. The Board observed that the relief introduced into AASB 13 by this Standard does not override\nthe general disclosure objective of AASB 13 as described in paragraph 91 of that Standard.  \nBC17 The Board observed that paragraph Aus93.1 of AASB 13 does not prevent a not-for-profit public sector\nentity from presenting some, or all, of the disclosures specified in paragraphs 93(d), 93(f) and 93(h)(i) in its\ngeneral purpose financial statements.",

The\nBoard decided not to extend the relief to such assets as it did not regard there to be differences in the\npurposes these assets are held, whether held by a for-profit private sector entity or not-for-profit public\nsector entity. Further, the Board considered that, for such assets, the costs of providing the disclosures did\nnot outweigh the benefits from making those disclosures in general purpose financial statements. The\nBoard noted that, unlike property, plant and equipment, there was not necessarily a significant difference\nbetween the sectors with regard to the extent to which fair value measurement is applied to these assets.  \n-----  BC19 The Board also discussed whether the relief from disclosure should be extended to include other assets\n(besides financial assets and investment properties) held by not-for-profit public sector entities that are\nmeasured at fair value and not held primarily for their current service potential.

Consequently, AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial\n_Reporting requires each WoG and GGS to elect an accounting treatment that aligns with GFS principles and_\nrequirements where an Accounting Standard permits a choice (AASB 1049 paragraph 13). Because GFS\nrequires assets and liabilities to be measured at current market value, this has resulted in each WoG and\nGGS electing to apply the revaluation model as its accounting policy and measure its non-financial assets,\nsuch as property, plant and equipment, at fair value under AASB 13.  \nBC3 Although AASB 1049 requires only WoG and GGS to align with GFS principles, some stakeholders from\nthe public sector have informed the Board that the Treasury or Finance Department (or other authority) or\nthe Office of Local Government in each jurisdiction has issued instructions to require the other public sector\nentities in their jurisdiction to also elect the accounting treatments that align with GFS principles, which has\nled to the majority of non-financial assets of public sector entities being measured at fair value.",

At its March 2011 and June 2011 meetings, the\nBoard decided not to include any not-for-profit entity modifications to the requirements of IFRS 13 adopted\nin AASB 13. At that time, the Board considered that even though many non-financial assets in the public\nsector might have a specialised nature or that observable market inputs might not be readily available, a\npublic sector entity would be able to measure the fair value of such assets at current replacement cost, under\nthe cost approach in IFRS 13.  \nBC5 At its December 2014 meeting, the Board considered feedback from stakeholders regarding the application\nof AASB 13. The Board decided to undertake a narrow-scope project to give relief from certain AASB 13\ndisclosures, limited to items of property, plant and equipment within the scope of AASB 116 _Property,_\n_Plant and Equipment that are held primarily for their current service capacity rather than primarily to_\ngenerate future net cash inflows, in relation to disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about\nthe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of such assets. This project resulted\nin AASB 2015-7 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Fair Value Disclosures of Not-for-_\n_Profit Public Sector Entities._  \nBC6 During the due process of developing AASB 2015-7 and consideration of Invitation to Comment ITC 34\n_AASB Agenda Consultation 2017\u20132019 (in which the Board sought views on its priorities for its work_\nprogram for the period 2017\u20132019), some stakeholders in the public sector asked the Board to provide\nguidance clarifying how to apply the requirements in AASB 13 to the fair value measurement of public\nsector entity assets.  \n-----  BC7 Many stakeholders in the public sector commented that applying AASB 13 had been challenging and costly.\nThey requested guidance on how to measure the fair value of non-financial assets of not-for-profit public\nsector entities not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows, in particular (but not limited\nto):  \n(a) the market participant assumptions to use in measuring fair value where a public sector entity\u2019s\nasset has few or no market participants (other than the holder of the asset) and where information\nabout market participants\u2019 inputs to a current replacement cost model may be scarce;  \n(b) how government-imposed public-sector-specific restrictions on non-financial assets should be\ntaken into account;  \n(c) how to measure the fair value of public sector entity assets using the cost approach; and  \n(d) the concept of obsolescence under the cost approach.  \nBC8 The Board was advised that the measurement issues are pervasive in the not-for-profit public sector and\ninvolve inconsistent practical application of the principles of AASB 13.  \nBC9 In addition, in considering its Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors Project, the Board decided at its\nFebruary 2016 meeting that, because a service concession asset is an asset that the grantor uses for its\nservice potential to achieve public service objectives (rather than to generate net cash inflows), only the cost\napproach to measuring fair value is relevant and, where the operator has been granted the right to future\ncash flows, this need not be considered in the measurement of the grantor\u2019s service concession asset. In\ndeveloping AASB 1059 _Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors, the Board noted that it did not_\nprovide guidance on the measurement of service concession assets on the grounds that this would best be\ndeveloped in a future project on the measurement of public sector assets \u2013 the Fair Value Measurement for\nNot-for-Profit Public Sector Entities Project (FVM project).",

If approved as a final pronouncement, ED 77 would establish a single comprehensive\nStandard that identifies and defines the measurement bases used in IPSAS for not-for-profit public sector\nentities.  \nBC13 ED 77 was developed based on the view that the fair value measurement basis under IFRS 13 (which is\nadopted in AASB 13) would be applicable to assets held for their financial capacity, but would be\ninappropriate for measuring the current value of assets held for their operational capacity (ie assets not held\nprimarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows). Instead, the IPSASB proposed a different current\nvalue measurement basis \u2013 current operational value \u2013 for measuring the current value of assets held for\ntheir operational capacity.  \nBC14 In contrast with fair value, which is a market-participant-based exit value reflecting an asset\u2019s highest and\nbest use, current operational value is proposed to be an entity-specific entry value based on an asset\u2019s\ncurrent use. The IPSASB proposed that the same three measurement techniques \u2013 the market, income and\ncost approaches \u2013 would be applicable in estimating both:  \n(a) an asset\u2019s fair value, for assets held primarily for their financial capacity; and  \n(b) an asset\u2019s current operational value, for assets held primarily for their operational capacity.  \nBC15 In accordance with paragraph 20 of _The_ _AASB\u2019s Approach to International Public Sector Accounting_\n_Standards (October 2019), in May 2021 the Board issued ITC 45_ _Request for Comment on IPSASB_  \n-----  _Exposure Drafts_ _ED 76 Conceptual Framework Update: Chapter 7, Measurement of Assets and Liabilities_\n_in Financial Statements_ _and ED 77 Measurement, to obtain Australian stakeholders\u2019 views on the_\nIPSASB\u2019s proposals.  \nBC16 The Board added AASB specific matters for comment in ITC 45 to specifically obtain views on whether\nAustralian stakeholders would prefer that the Board adopts, in respect of current value measurement of nonfinancial assets of not-for-profit entities not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows, the\nIPSASB\u2019s proposed current operational value measurement basis or continues requiring the fair value\nmeasurement basis.  \nBC17 The Board received six comment letters on ITC 45. Based on those comment letters and on the feedback\nreceived from related outreach activities, the Board noted that a significant majority of stakeholders that\nresponded to ITC 45, including not-for-profit public sector entities\u2019 financial statement preparers, auditors\nand valuers, indicated that fair value under AASB 13 is appropriate for measuring the current value of all\nnon-financial assets held by not-for-profit public sector entities, whether held primarily for their financial\ncapacity or operational capacity, and should remain the sole current value measurement basis.  \nBC18 The majority of these stakeholders also commented that they agree with applying the \u2018highest and best use\u2019\nand \u2018market participants\u2019 concepts under fair value for measuring the current value of non-financial assets\nnot held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows, although some stakeholders have sought the\nBoard\u2019s guidance to assist entities to understand better how these concepts should be applied in the not-forprofit public sector context. They considered that applying the fair value basis to all non-financial assets,\ndespite the need to exercise judgement in applying those concepts, would be preferable to applying two\nmeasurement bases, as proposed in the IPSASB\u2019s Exposure Drafts. This is because it would avoid:  \n(a) the need for financial statement preparers, auditors and valuers to understand the requirements of\ntwo measurement bases;  \n(b) imposing potential additional costs and effort to assess which measurement basis is appropriate\nfor each asset or class of assets, or to reassess the appropriate measurement basis when there is a\nchange in how an entity uses an asset; and  \n(c) reporting to users of financial statements of not-for-profit public sector entities current values\nbased on mixed measurement bases, which would reduce the comparability and understandability\nof the totals reported.  \nBC19 At the date of issue of this Standard, the IPSASB was continuing to develop a Measurement Standard and\nrelated amendments to its Conceptual Framework based on its proposals in ED 76 and ED 77.",

        "page_content=": "## Stakeholder feedback on the Fatal-Flaw Review draft version  \nBC25 In October 2022, the Board issued for comment a Fatal-Flaw Review draft version of the Standard. The\nBoard received written submissions on the draft Standard from three respondents, who also responded to\nED 320. The Board also received comments from Panel members during a Panel meeting held in November\n2022.  \nBC26 Of the three respondents who provided a written submission:  \n(a) one supported all the Board\u2019s proposals;  \n(b) one supported all the proposed principles in the draft Standard but commented that certain areas\nof the draft Standard can be refined; and  \n(c) the ED respondent who disagreed with most aspects of the ED 320 proposals elaborated on their\ndisagreement with the Board\u2019s proposals.  \nBC27 The respondent referred to in paragraph BC26(c) expressed the following concerns about the proposals in\ntheir submissions on ED 320 and the Fatal-Flaw Review draft:  \n(a) fair value measurements of some assets would be affected by an entity\u2019s subjective assessment of\nwhether the asset is held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows (which therefore\nwould determine whether the asset\u2019s fair value measurement is subject to the proposed\nmodifications to AASB 13). Uniform guidance on fair value measurement should be applicable to\nall reporting entities, regardless of their sector, because the principles of valuation hold regardless\nof the sector in which the entity controlling the asset operates;  \n(b) modifying AASB 13, such as adding to AASB 13 criteria that constrain when an alternative use\nmay be identified as an asset\u2019s highest and best use and introducing non-financial influences into\nthe concept of financial feasibility, would be likely to result in departures from the principles of\nIFRS 13; and  \n(c) the notion that hypothetical not-for-profit public sector market participant buyers exist for public\nsector entity assets is ethereal and unrealistic. The respondent considers that the hypothetical\ntransaction underpinning the fair value concept in AASB 13 should be supported by actual market\nactivity, or the generation of actual cash flows that support assumptions about what that market\nactivity might be.  \nBC28 In addition, the respondent made the following comments:  \n(a) fair value and market value are one and the same. The same estimate of fair value should result\nfor a given asset, regardless of whether the market approach, income approach or cost approach is\nused; and  \n(b) the costs associated with the provision of community service obligations are never more\ntransparent than when a new public sector asset is valued at less than its cost of acquisition, and\nwhen the continuing use of a community asset is deemed not to be that asset\u2019s highest and best\nuse. The public sector does not necessarily make investment decisions based on the concept of\nhighest and best use. However, users of financial statements should be provided the opportunity\nto identify when this occurs.  \nBC29 In respect of the respondent\u2019s concerns noted in paragraph BC27(a), the Board observed that a precedent\nexists in the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards for not-for-profit entities to base the\nmeasurement of assets on whether they are held primarily to generate net cash inflows. AASB 136\n_Impairment of Assets does not apply to specialised assets of not-for-profit entities that are held for_\ncontinuing use of their service capacity and not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows\nif those assets are regularly revalued to fair value (AASB 136 paragraph Aus5.1). In relation to the\nrespondent\u2019s comment \u2013 that uniform guidance on fair value measurement should be applicable to all\nreporting entities regardless of their sector \u2013 the _AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework_\nsets out the circumstances in which not-for-profit or public-sector-specific modifications to IFRS Standards  \n-----  are justified. As discussed in paragraphs BC39\u2013BC41, the Board considers that all decisions leading to the\nmodifications to AASB 13 set out in this Standard complied with that Framework.  \nBC30 In respect of the respondent\u2019s comment about departures from the principles of IFRS 13, noted in paragraph\nBC27(b), the Board took into account the possibility of non-conformity with IFRS 13 in some fair value\nmeasurements, as explained in paragraphs BC37 and BC38. As noted in paragraphs BC39\u2013BC41, the Board\nconcluded that the particular features of the public sector \u2013 together with cost/benefit considerations \u2013\nwarrant that risk.  \nBC31 The Board observed that the notion of hypothetical not-for-profit public sector market participant buyers\nreferred to in paragraph BC27(c) above is key to not measuring the fair values of many public sector entity\nassets at scrap value. This is supported by the IASB\u2019s Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 13, paragraph BC78,\nthat \u201c\u2026 In effect, the market participant buyer steps into the shoes of the entity that holds that specialised\nasset.\u201d  \nBC32 The IASB noted in paragraph BC79 of its Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 13 that sometimes an observed\nmarket price \u2013 one for sale on a stand-alone basis \u2013 will not reflect an asset\u2019s fair value (because it does not\nreflect the value that the asset contributes to the entity, which is achieved by using the subject asset in\ncombination with other assets). The IASB\u2019s rationale seems to provide a precedent for concluding that\nhypothetical not-for-profit public sector market participant buyers would be willing to pay more than a\nstand-alone selling price for an asset if the asset generates greater benefits when used in combination with\nother assets.  \nBC33 The Board considered that the comments in paragraphs BC78 and BC79 of the IASB\u2019s Basis for\nConclusions on IFRS 13 suggest that the respondent\u2019s view noted in paragraph BC28(a) \u2013 that the same\nestimate of fair value should result for a given asset, regardless of whether the market approach, income\napproach or cost approach is used \u2013 would not always hold true.  \nBC34 As noted in paragraph BC28(b), the respondent expressed a view that users of financial statements should\nalways be provided the opportunity to identify when an asset is not generating the return expected from the\nasset\u2019s highest and best use. The Board considered that this concern stems mainly from the different\nperceptions of what an asset\u2019s highest and best use is and the respondent\u2019s disagreement with the Board\u2019s\nview that other not-for-profit public sector entities should be considered market participants for a nonfinancial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity held primarily for its service potential rather than to\ngenerate net cash inflows (the subject asset). Under that Board view, another not-for-profit public sector\nmarket participant is likely to:  \n(a) be willing to pay a higher price, if necessary, for the subject asset than the amount on which an\ninvestment return is expected from any net cash inflows the subject asset generates; and  \n(b) continue the subject asset\u2019s current use (unless the presumption is rebutted) on the basis that the\nmarket participant \u2018stepping into the shoes\u2019 of the not-for-profit public sector entity holding the\nsubject asset would use the asset to continue providing services to the community rather than for\nan alternative use.  \nBC35 As explained in paragraphs BC31and BC32 above, the Board\u2019s view is consistent with the view of the\nIASB in IFRS 13. Other respondents to ED 320/Fatal-Flaw Review draft expressed agreement with this\nview and support the Board\u2019s proposals. Accordingly, the Board decided to proceed with the modifications\nto AASB 13.",

        "page_content=": "## Comparison with IFRS 13  \nBC36 The Board observed that not-for-profit public sector entities complying with this Standard might not comply\nwith IFRS 13.  \nBC37 This Standard makes the following modifications to the requirements of IFRS 13 adopted in AASB 13,\nwhich apply only to fair value measurements of non-financial assets of not-for-profit public sector entities\nnot held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows:  \n(a) an entity is required to consider whether an asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current\nuse only when, at the measurement date, it is:  \n(i) classified as held for sale or held for distribution to owners in accordance with AASB 5\n_Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations; or_  \n(ii) highly probable that the asset will be used for an alternative purpose to its current use\n(see paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2);  \n-----  (b) an asset\u2019s use is \u2018financially feasible\u2019 if market participants would be willing to invest in the\nasset\u2019s service capacity, considering both the capability of the asset to be used to provide needed\ngoods or services to beneficiaries and the resulting cost of those goods or services (see paragraph\nAus28.1);  \n(c) if both the market selling price of a comparable asset and some market participant data required\nto measure the fair value of an asset are not observable, the entity is required to use its own\nassumptions as a starting point in developing unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of the\nsubject asset and adjust those assumptions to the extent that reasonably available information\nindicates that other market participants would use different data (see paragraphs F5 and F11(b));\nand  \n(d) if an asset is measured using the cost approach, the entity is required:  \n(i) to assume that the asset will be replaced in its existing location, even if it would be\nfeasible to replace the asset in a cheaper location at the measurement date (see\nparagraph F11(a)); and  \n(ii) not to identify economic obsolescence for the asset if the asset contains \u2018surplus\ncapacity\u2019 necessary for stand-by or safety purposes (see paragraph F17).  \nBC38 IFRS 13 does not specify:  \n(a) that the entity\u2019s own data is required to be used as a starting point under certain circumstances.\nIFRS 13 paragraph 89 states that the entity\u2019s own data _may be used as a starting point when_\ndeveloping unobservable inputs;  \n(b) any specific criteria for determining when market or other factors suggest that an alternative use\nof an asset by market participants would be the asset\u2019s highest and best use. Consequently, the\nmodification of AASB 13 in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 \u2013 specifying that an entity is\nrequired to consider whether the asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use only\nwhen, at the measurement date, it is classified as held for sale or held for distribution to owners in\naccordance with AASB 5 or it is highly probable that the asset will be used for an alternative\npurpose to its current use \u2013 creates the potential for particular fair value measurements to be noncompliant with IFRS 13. This is because applying paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 might delay\nthe identification of a higher and better alternative use compared with application of paragraph 29\nof IFRS 13 alone. The Board concluded such potential for non-compliance with IFRS 13 is\nwarranted by the unique aspects of the processes in the public sector for selling, distributing to\nowners or redeploying assets (see paragraphs BC52\u2013BC59);  \n(c) that the capability of the asset to be used to provide needed goods or services and the resulting\ncost of those goods or services need to be considered (instead of whether a use of the asset would\ngenerate an investment return on that asset) when considering whether a use of an asset is\nfinancially feasible (see paragraphs BC82\u2013BC88); and  \n(d) how the cost approach should be applied, beyond the brief requirements in IFRS 13 paragraphs\nB8 and B9.  \nThe requirements of this Standard noted in paragraphs BC37 and BC38 might not comply with IFRS 13.  \nBC39 The Board made reference to paragraphs 25 and 30 of the _AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting_\n_Framework, which state that, when justified, the Board would modify IFRS Standards to address not-for-_\nprofit specific issues, including those involving:  \n(a) undue widespread and significant diversity in accounting practices (see paragraph 25(g)); and  \n(b) cost or effort of preparing and disclosing information that outweighs the benefits to users (see\nparagraph 30(h)).  \nBC40 As mentioned in paragraphs BC7 and BC8, many public sector stakeholders commented that applying\nAASB 13 had been challenging and costly and that the measurement issues are pervasive in the not-forprofit public sector and involve inconsistent practical application of the principles of AASB 13.\nAccordingly, the Board undertook the FVM project to provide guidance that:  \n(a) assists the not-for-profit public sector to apply the principles of AASB 13 more consistently; and  \n(b) enables the application of AASB 13 in a more cost-effective manner by clarifying its application,\nincluding clarifying the extent to which preparers of financial statements need to search for\ninformation in the absence of observable market inputs to fair value measurements.  \nBC41 In addition, the modifications in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 regarding an asset\u2019s highest and best use\nare designed to reduce the cost and effort of a not-for-profit public sector entity resulting from searching  \n-----  unnecessarily for possible alternative uses of an asset not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash\ninflows.  \nBC42 The Board observed that the modifications to AASB 13 in this Amending Standard:  \n(a) would not necessarily change practice for some not-for-profit public sector entities; and  \n(b) do not indicate that entities changing practice in how they measure relevant assets made an error\nin applying the existing requirements of AASB 13.",

Paragraph 29 of AASB 13 states that \u201c\u2026 an entity\u2019s current use of a non-financial\nasset is presumed to be its highest and best use unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by\nmarket participants would maximise the value of the asset.\u201d  \nBC44 Regarding whether the current use of a non-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held\nprimarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows is presumed to be its highest and best use, the Board\nobserved that IFRS 13 paragraph 29 (quoted in paragraph BC43) and the related IASB Basis for\nConclusions paragraph (quoted below) provide guidance:  \nIFRS 13 does not require an entity to perform an exhaustive search for other potential uses of a\nnon-financial asset if there is no evidence to suggest that the current use of an asset is not its\nhighest and best use \u2026 the IASB concluded that in many cases it would be unlikely for an asset\u2019s\ncurrent use not to be its highest and best use after taking into account the costs to convert the\nasset to the alternative use. (IFRS 13 paragraph BC71)  \nBC45 However, despite that IASB text, some stakeholders requested the Board to provide additional guidance\nabout the highest and best use of non-financial assets referred to in paragraph BC44. These stakeholders do\nnot consider the cost incurred to search for possible alternative uses of such an asset is justified when such\nan asset is very unlikely to be used for a purpose other than its current use, for the many cases in which the\nasset is:  \n(a) specialised, especially if the costs to convert the asset to the alternative use are high; and  \n(b) being used to provide necessary services to the public and, therefore, the public sector entity\nholding the asset is highly likely to continue using the asset to provide those services.  \nBC46 The Board considered the request and decided to modify AASB 13 to reduce the cost and effort of an entity\nsearching unnecessarily for possible alternative uses of a not-for-profit public sector entity\u2019s non-financial\nasset not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows. This is discussed in paragraphs BC49 to\nBC81.  \nBC47 In addition, stakeholders requested the Board to provide guidance assisting not-for-profit public sector\nentities to apply the three concepts specified in paragraph 28 of AASB 13 for identifying the highest and\nbest use of non-financial assets not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows (which has\npractical effect when the presumption that the asset\u2019s current use is its highest and best use is rebutted, after\nconsidering the circumstances in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 in which that might be the case). The\nBoard decided that, in respect of such assets, implementation guidance is needed for the \u2018financially\nfeasible use\u2019 concept in paragraph 28(c) of AASB 13, but implementation guidance is not needed regarding\nthe application of the \u2018physically possible use\u2019 and \u2018legally permissible use\u2019 concepts in paragraphs 28(a)\nand 28(b). The Board\u2019s views on the \u2018physically possible use\u2019 and \u2018legally permissible use\u2019 concepts are set\nout in paragraphs BC96\u2013BC112.  \nBC48 The Board concluded that, although the \u2018financially feasible use\u2019 concept should apply to fair value\nmeasurements of any non-financial asset, for an asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held\nprimarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows, paragraph 28(c) of AASB 13 should be clarified in\nterms relevant to the not-for-profit public sector environment. Therefore, the Board added paragraph\nAus28.1 in AASB 13. This is explained in paragraphs BC82\u2013BC88.  \n-----  ",

The Board considered that a\nhigher and better use than the asset\u2019s current use may be identified when the not-for-profit public sector\nentity has committed to a plan to sell such an asset or to use the asset for an alternative use, because the\nentity would have determined that the alternative use would generate greater benefits than its current use.  \nBC50 For an asset subject to a committed-to plan of sale by an appropriate level of management, a conclusion that\nthe asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use could be reached earlier than when the asset\nmeets the classification requirement as \u2018held for sale\u2019 under AASB 5. Under paragraphs 6\u20138 of AASB 5,\namong other conditions, a non-current asset is classified as held for sale only if the asset is available for\nimmediate sale and its sale must be highly probable. For the sale to be highly probable, the appropriate level\nof management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset, and an active programme to locate a buyer and\ncomplete the plan must have been initiated. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, the sale should be\nexpected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, and it\nmust be unlikely that significant changes to (or withdrawal of) the plan will occur.  \nBC51 Under the Board\u2019s proposal in ED 320, for an asset subject to a committed-to plan of sale by an appropriate\nlevel of management, to conclude that the asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use, the\nentity\u2019s appropriate level of management need not have initiated, at the measurement date, an active\nprogramme to:  \n(a) locate a buyer; or  \n(b) complete the plan to use the asset for an alternative purpose.",

        "page_content=": "### Stakeholder feedback on ED 320 and the Board\u2019s redeliberations\nBC52 Eleven of the twelve ED respondents to this topic expressed support for modifying AASB 13 to limit the\ncircumstances in which the current use presumption would be rebutted. The respondent who disagreed with\nany modification to AASB 13 that would constrain identifying a higher and better alternative use of an asset\nconsidered that the hypothetical transaction underpinning the fair value concept in AASB 13 should be\nsupported by actual market activity or the generation of actual cash flows that support assumptions about\nwhat that market activity might be. They consider that if an asset\u2019s fair value measurement does not reflect\nits market value, it would inadvertently affect an entity\u2019s assessment of the true cost of the assets being\ndeployed for service delivery.  \nBC53 That respondent was concerned that the ED proposals would affect fair value measurements of some public\nsector assets due to:  \n(a) the subjective assessment by an entity\u2019s management of whether an asset is held primarily for its\nability to generate net cash inflows;  \n(b) the decision by the entity\u2019s management about how the asset will be used; and  \n(c) the notion of a hypothetical not-for-profit public sector entity market participant buyer being\nethereal and lacking market activity on which to base a fair value estimate.  \nBC54 In response to that respondent\u2019s concerns, as noted in paragraphs BC31 and BC32, the Board observed that\nthe notion of hypothetical not-for-profit public sector market participant buyers is key to not measuring the\nfair values of many specialised public sector entity assets at scrap value. This is supported by the IASB\u2019s\nBasis for Conclusions on IFRS 13, paragraph BC78, which states that \u201c\u2026 In effect, the market participant\nbuyer steps into the shoes of the entity that holds that specialised asset.\u201d Also, the IASB noted in paragraph\nBC79 of its Basis for Conclusions that sometimes an observed market price \u2013 one for sale on a stand-alone\nbasis \u2013 will not reflect an asset\u2019s fair value (because it does not reflect the value that the specialised asset\ncontributes to the entity, which is achieved by using the specialised asset in combination with other assets).  \nBC55 The Board considered that the IASB\u2019s rationale provides an equivalent precedent for hypothetical not-forprofit public sector market participant buyers existing for public sector entity assets at a higher level of\naggregation than the unit of account for observed sales of individual public sector assets. In addition, the\nBoard concluded that fair value estimates for non-financial assets not held primarily for their ability to  \n-----  generate net cash inflows should not depend on the net cash inflows expected to be generated by those\nassets.  \nBC56 The Board acknowledged the concern (noted in paragraph BC38(b)) that limiting the circumstances in\nwhich the current use presumption may be rebutted could result in some fair value measurements being\nnon-compliant with IFRS 13 because they might delay the identification of a higher and better alternative\nuse compared with application of paragraph 29 of IFRS 13 alone.  \nBC57 However, the Board considered that this potential for IFRS non-compliance should be insignificant. This is\nbecause the Board considers that a non-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held\nprimarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows:  \n(a) often is different in nature from an asset with similar features but held primarily for its ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows, because the nature of the benefits it provides is different;  \n(b) is subject to a different operational (public sector) environment that reduces the likelihood \u2013\ncompared with that of an asset held by a private sector entity \u2013 of realising a potential opportunity\nto be sold for a higher and better alternative use, and therefore reduces the relevance of such an\nopportunity to assumptions made by market participants when pricing the asset;  \n(c) if specialised, is unlikely to be used for another purpose, especially if the costs to convert the\nasset to an alternative use are high; and  \n(d) often is being used to provide necessary services to the public and, therefore, another not-forprofit public sector entity stepping into the shoes of the public sector entity holding the asset\nwould base its pricing decisions on the asset\u2019s current use.  \nBC58 Even if particular fair value measurements under the proposed modifications to AASB 13 were considered\nnot to be compliant with IFRS 13, the Board concluded they would be justified on cost-benefit grounds in\naccordance with paragraph 30(h) of the _AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework. The_\nproposal regarding the identification of an asset\u2019s highest and best use is designed to reduce the cost and\neffort of a not-for-profit public sector entity searching unnecessarily for possible alternative uses of an asset.  \nBC59 Some Board members consider that if AASB 13 is modified to specify when the asset\u2019s current use ceases\nto be its highest and best use, doing so should drive more consistency between the asset\u2019s use and the\nasset\u2019s value reported on financial statements, rather than reporting the asset\u2019s value based on a possible\nalternative use. In addition, the proposal would not restrict the choice of valuation techniques to apply in\nmeasuring a not-for-profit public sector entity\u2019s asset.  \n_Timing of when the current use presumption may be rebutted_  \nBC60 Although the significant majority of ED respondents agreed with modifying AASB 13 to limit the\ncircumstances in which the current use presumption may be rebutted, some ED respondents disagreed that\nan entity\u2019s appropriate level of management having committed to a plan to sell the asset would, of itself, be\nsufficient to require an entity to reassess the asset\u2019s highest and best use (with a potential consequence that\nthe asset\u2019s fair value would be remeasured). Those respondents argued that reassessing the asset\u2019s highest\nand best use should not occur until the asset has met the criteria for classification as \u2018held for sale\u2019 under\nAASB 5 and/or formal approval has been made to sell the asset or distribute it to owners.  \nBC61 They noted that, under the proposal in ED 320, when the asset subsequently meets the criteria for\nclassification as \u2018held for sale\u2019 under AASB 5, another fair value estimate would need to be determined for\nthe asset, and expressed concern that this outcome would cause undue cost and effort. They argued that,\nunlike for most assets held by for-profit entities, the sale of various assets held by not-for-profit public\nsector entities requires a complex and lengthy approval process (sometimes requiring legislative\namendment) that can cause the elapse of a significant period between when an asset satisfies the\n\u2018committed-to plan to sell the asset\u2019 condition proposed in ED 320 and when the criteria for classification as\n\u2018held for sale\u2019 in AASB 5 are satisfied. For these reasons, they argued that applying the ED proposals\nwould:  \n(a) give rise to a significant risk of premature (and additional) remeasurement because of the greater\nrisk of changes in management plans stemming from the complexity of public sector processes\nfor selling or redeploying assets;  \n(b) give rise to a significant risk of information leakage regarding sales of assets during a confidential\ntender process;  \n(c) obligate controlled entities to seek information about decisions by senior levels of government to\nwhich they might not be privy until sale of an asset becomes highly probable and/or imminent (ie\nwhen the criteria for classification as \u2018held for sale\u2019 are met). This is because, in the public sector\nenvironment, sometimes the plan to dispose of or redeploy an asset is initiated by a controlling  \n-----  entity of the holder of the asset, and the asset\u2019s holder does not learn of this plan until later\n(because the sale process for the asset is conducted confidentially for some time). Similarly, until\nan asset is ready for sale in the condition intended by an entity\u2019s appropriate level of\nmanagement, a higher and better use for the asset is unlikely to be evident;  \n(d) be potentially difficult and subjective to apply, because it would often be difficult in a public\nsector environment to determine exactly when an entity\u2019s appropriate level of management has\nbecome \u2018committed to a plan\u2019 to sell an asset, and consequently be likely to result in significant\ninconsistency in practice; and  \n(e) not be consistent with a GAAP/GFS harmonisation objective, because being \u2018committed to a plan\nto sell an asset\u2019 is not an explicit concept that can be applied from a macroeconomic statistics\nperspective.  \nBC62 For the reasons described in paragraph BC61, those respondents argued that this issue is a public-sectorspecific issue that warrants deeming that a higher and better use than current use would not arise until an\nasset satisfies the criteria for classification as \u2018held for sale\u2019 under AASB 5.  \nBC63 In developing ED 320, the Board was concerned that waiting until all the criteria in AASB 5 for classifying\nan asset as \u2018held for sale\u2019 are met could deprive users of financial statements of a not-for-profit public sector\nentity of useful information about an alternative use having become an asset\u2019s highest and best use, as\nsupported by the due diligence underpinning a decision by the entity\u2019s appropriate level of management to\ncommit to a plan to take one of those steps. For example, if an appropriate level of management commits to\nbegin using an asset (such as equipment) for a commercial purpose (eg by leasing out that equipment) while\nawaiting approval of the asset\u2019s sale, it could deprive users of information about the asset\u2019s value if an\nentity waits until the classification criteria for being \u2018held for sale\u2019 in AASB 5 are met before taking into\naccount the commitment to change the asset\u2019s use.  \nBC64 On balance, the Board considered that the concerns noted in paragraph BC61 outweigh these concerns in\nparagraph BC63. In addition, the Board noted that:  \n(a) in the public sector, many non-financial assets other than land are specialised assets without\nalternative uses; and  \n(b) the requirements of AASB 5 are well understood by preparers and auditors of financial statements\nof not-for-profit public sector entities. Therefore, aligning the timing of potentially identifying a\nhigher and better alternative use with the criteria in AASB 5 should reduce the time and effort by\npreparers and auditors and reduce inconsistency in application.  \nBC65 Therefore, the Board decided to issue for comment a Fatal-Flaw Review draft version of the Standard to\npropose that an entity is not required to consider whether an asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its\ncurrent use unless the asset has met the criteria for classification as \u2018held for sale\u2019 under AASB 5 or it is\nhighly probable that the asset will be used for an alternative purpose to its current use.  \nBC66 In reaching its decision referred to in paragraph BC65, the Board considered the other alternative to the ED\nproposals expressed by respondents, namely, identifying a higher and better use of an asset upon formal\napproval of selling the asset or distributing it to owners. The Board concluded that this other alternative\nwould not sufficiently address the concerns expressed by respondents regarding the proposal in ED 320,\nbecause formal approval of sale or distribution to owners can precede sale by an extended period. In\ncontrast, the AASB 5 criteria for an asset being \u2018held for sale\u2019 include that the sale should be expected to\nqualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.  \nBC67 Consistent with ED 320, and in contrast with AASB 5, the Board considered that it is not essential that a\npotential higher and better alternative use of an asset is identified only through a future sale of the asset: the\nasset\u2019s higher and better alternative use could be identified through future redeployment for an alternative\npurpose. Substantially the same point for requiring an entity to consider whether a higher and better\nalternative use of an asset might have arisen should apply to assets that would be sold or redeployed.",

        "page_content=": "### Proposal in Fatal-Flaw Review draft Standard\nBC68 The Board noted that paragraphs 7 and 8 of AASB 5 require all the following criteria to be met for an asset\nto be classified as \u2018held for sale\u2019:  \n(a) the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that\nare usual and customary for sales of such assets;  \n(b) the appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset;  \n(c) an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated;  \n-----  (d) the asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current\nfair value;  \n(e) the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from\nthe date of classification (except for specific conditions permitted by paragraph 9 of AASB 5),\nand actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant\nchanges to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn; and  \n(f) the probability of shareholders\u2019 approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as\npart of the assessment of whether the sale is highly probable.  \nBC69 The Board decided to propose in the Fatal-Flaw Review draft the overarching principle for potentially\nidentifying a higher and better alternative use is that the sale or alternative use must be \u2018highly probable\u2019. In\nthe case of an asset with a potentially higher and better alternative use identified from a future sale or\ndistribution to owners, the \u2018highly probable\u2019 test would be met when the asset meets the criteria for\nclassification as \u2018held for sale\u2019 under AASB 5. For an asset with a higher and better alternative use\nidentified from a future redeployment, the Board adapted the criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 of AASB 5.  \nBC70 The following table outlines the AASB 5 criteria and the conditions proposed in the Fatal-Flaw Review\ndraft for determining whether it is highly probable that the asset will be used for an alternative purpose.  \n|Criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 of AASB 5|The Board\u2019s decision when developing the Fatal-Flaw Review draft|\n|---|---|\n|Not applicable.|(i) Added a criterion that the alternative use of the asset is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible in accordance with paragraph 28 and the proposed paragraph Aus28.1.|\n|(a) The asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets.|(ii) Adapted this criterion as \u201cthe asset is immediately available to be used for the alternative purpose in its present condition.\u201d|\n|(b) The appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset.|(iii) Adapted these two criteria as \u201cthe appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to change the usage of the asset to that alternative purpose, and an active programme to complete the plan has been initiated.\u201d|\n|(c) An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated.||\n|(d) The asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value.|Omitted criterion (d) because it is specific to a sale transaction and is not relevant for determining whether it is highly probable that an asset will be redeployed.|\n|(e) The sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification (except for specific conditions permitted by paragraph 9 of AASB 5), and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.|(iv) Adapted this criterion as \u201cThe change in the asset\u2019s use is expected to be completed within one year from the measurement date. Actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\u201d|\n|(f) The probability of shareholders\u2019 approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the sale is highly probable.|(v) Adapted this criterion as \u201cAny approvals required to change the asset\u2019s usage have been obtained.\u201d|  \n**Stakeholder feedback on the Fatal-Flaw Review draft and the Board\u2019s**\n**redeliberations**  \n_Assets that will be used for an alternative purpose_  \nBC71 During the outreach connected to the Fatal-Flaw Review draft, some stakeholders requested the Board to\nclarify the conditions determining whether an asset would be judged to be highly probable to be used for an  \n-----  alternative purpose. After considering those stakeholder comments, the Board decided to revise those\nproposed conditions (noted in the table in paragraph BC70), as follows:  \n(a) amend the criterion in (iv) of the table to:  \n(i) clarify the proposed principle that \u201cthe change in the asset\u2019s use is expected to be\ncompleted within one year from the measurement date\u201d by stipulating the more specific\ncondition that \u201cbased on reasonably available information, it is highly probable that the\ncurrent use of the asset will cease under the plan within one year\u201d (of the measurement\ndate); and  \n(ii) delete the condition that: \u201cActions required to complete the plan should indicate that it\nis unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be\nwithdrawn\u201d because that condition is encompassed by the condition that cessation of\nthe asset\u2019s current use within one year is highly probable; and  \n(b) remove the proposed condition in (ii) of the table \u2013 that \u201cthe asset is immediately available to be\nused for the alternative purpose in its present condition\u201d. In respect of an asset that will be\nredeployed, this condition may sometimes be satisfied after satisfying condition (iv).  \nBC72 In making the decisions noted in paragraph BC71(a), the Board:  \n(a) considered that, if reasonably available information exists that cessation of the asset\u2019s current use\nwill occur within one year of the measurement date, and the other conditions in paragraph\nAus29.2 are met, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the asset\u2019s current use is no longer its\nhighest and best use. It would be inappropriate for an asset to continue to be measured based on\nits current use when cessation of that use is imminent and an active programme to complete the\nplanned change of use has been initiated;  \n(b) to avoid imposing a potential requirement to seek information about decisions made by senior\nlevels of government but not yet communicated to the holder of the subject asset, added a\nqualifier in paragraph Aus29.2(d) that the condition would be triggered only if reasonably\navailable information exists that it is met; and  \n(c) noted that being \u201chighly probable that the current use of the asset will cease within one year\u201d\naligns with the text in paragraph 8 of AASB 5.  \nBC73 In making the decision noted in paragraph BC71(b), the Board noted that applying the condition in (ii) of\nthe table in paragraph BC70 could result, inappropriately, in an asset being measured based on its original\nuse when that use has ceased. For example, an asset might take several years to adapt for its alternative use.\nThat alternative use might be the predominant source of benefits once cessation of the asset\u2019s current use is\nimminent, and would be the only source of benefits if the asset\u2019s original use has ceased (and its\nrecommencement is unrealistic). The Board also noted the objective of AASB 5 for initially classifying an\nasset as \u2018held for sale\u2019 is to determine the point from which the asset\u2019s carrying amount will be recovered\nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use (AASB 5 paragraph 6).  \n_Transfers of assets_  \nBC74 A stakeholder requested the Board to clarify whether the proposed conditions in (i)\u2013(v) of the table in\nparagraph BC70 would apply to assets that will be transferred to another entity in neither a sale nor a\ndistribution to owners. The Board considered that while the asset continues to be recognised (ie until\ntransferred), the not-for-profit public sector entity is not required to consider whether the asset\u2019s highest and\nbest use differs from its current use unless all conditions in paragraph Aus29.2 are met.  \nBC75 Another stakeholder requested the Board to clarify whether an entity is required to assess whether an asset\u2019s\ncurrent use remains its highest and best use if the asset will be transferred to another entity in the same\ngovernment and will be used for the same purpose as its current use, such as in a machinery of government\ntransfer. The Board considered that, in the situation described by the stakeholder, an entity may determine\nthat the asset\u2019s current use remains its highest and best use until the asset is transferred, which would occur\nif one or more conditions in paragraph Aus29.2 have not been met (eg if cessation of the asset\u2019s current use\nwithin one year of the measurement date is not (based on reasonably available information) highly probable\nand, therefore, paragraph Aus29.2(d) has not been met).  \n_Other observation_  \nBC76 The Board observed that paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 provide guidance on conditions that must be met\nto potentially conclude that, regarding paragraph 29 of AASB 13, factors suggest that a different use by\nmarket participants (including other not-for-profit public sector entities) would maximise the value of the  \n-----  asset. However, meeting the conditions in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 for needing to consider whether\nan asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use would not necessarily indicate that the asset\u2019s\nhighest and best use differs from its current use (although such a conclusion would typically be reached).\nOnce an asset meets the applicable conditions in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2, the entity reassesses the\nasset\u2019s highest and best use \u2013 the outcome of which will depend on the facts and circumstances.",

The Board considered that an entity needs to apply\njudgement in determining the appropriate level of management, which will depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of individual assets. In this context, the appropriate level of management might depend on,\nfor example, the asset\u2019s significance, the requirements (legislative and policy) and conventions for decision\nmaking in the public sector, and the resulting governance structure affecting the not-for-profit public sector\nentity.  \nBC78 The Board observed that typical examples of the appropriate level of management of an entity holding an\nasset not primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows would include a local government council, the\nentity\u2019s chief executive officer and, where the entity is controlled by a government, the entity\u2019s responsible\nMinister or the Cabinet of that government.  \nBC79 It should be noted that if a non-financial asset\u2019s alternative use is identified as its highest and best use and\nthe alternative use has a primary purpose of generating net cash inflows, the asset would subsequently be\noutside the scope of this Amending Standard.  \n**Disclosure where the highest and best use of an asset differs from its current**\n**use (paragraph Aus93.2)**  \nBC80 Paragraph 93(i) of AASB 13 includes the following disclosure requirement: \u201c\u2026 for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, if the highest and best use of a non-financial asset differs from its\ncurrent use, an entity shall disclose that fact and why the non-financial asset is being used in a manner that\ndiffers from its highest and best use.\u201d Some ED respondents commented that there is uncertainty whether\nthe proposed principle that the asset\u2019s current use is presumed to be its highest and best use unless rebutted\nunder the ED\u2019s proposed criteria would also be applicable to the disclosure requirement in paragraph 93(i)\nof AASB 13. That is, the Board was advised of concern that the relief from having to search for nebulous\npossible higher and better uses of an asset might be negated if that relief does not apply to the requirements\nof paragraph 93(i) of AASB 13.  \nBC81 The Board noted that disclosures under paragraph 93(i) of AASB 13 would not be required unless the entity\nhas determined that the asset\u2019s highest and best use differs from its current use. In addition, the Board\nconcluded that an entity should be required to consider whether this difference exists only when, in\naccordance with paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2, at the measurement date the asset is classified as held for\nsale or held for distribution to owners in accordance with AASB 5 or it is highly probable that the asset will\nbe used for an alternative purpose to its current use. For the avoidance of doubt, the Board decided to\ninclude paragraph Aus93.2 to make this explicit.",

Such an interpretation could result in measurements that do not reflect faithfully the\nservice potential embodied in those assets for which market participants would be prepared to pay in a\nhypothetical sale transaction. The Board noted that for many assets not held primarily for their ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows, their fair value would be measured at current replacement cost (under the cost\napproach), and although these assets often generate considerable cash inflows through \u2018indirect\u2019 sources,\nsuch as appropriations and grants, these cash inflows typically would not be included in assessments of\n\u2018investment returns\u2019 such as the cash inflows used in applying the income approach.  \n-----  BC84 In commenting on the ED and the Fatal-Flaw Review draft, a stakeholder expressed concern that the\nBoard\u2019s proposed not-for-profit public sector entity guidance on the concept of financially feasible use in\nparagraph Aus28.1 would introduce non-financial influences into the concept of financial feasibility and\nsignificantly distort the meaning of that concept. The stakeholder requested clarification of the following\nquestions related to the Board\u2019s proposed paragraph Aus28.1:  \n(a) if fair value is not a measure of an asset\u2019s capacity to generate an investment return, which\nbenefits are to be measured under paragraph Aus28.1; and  \n(b) under paragraph Aus28.1, would there be any circumstances under which the income approach\nmay be applied to measure the fair value of a non-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector\nentity not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows?  \nBC85 In response to the stakeholder\u2019s question noted in paragraphs BC84 (stem) and BC84(a), the Board observes\nthat, for any fair value measurement, regardless of the nature of the entity, the concept of future economic\nbenefits or service potential must reflect benefits for which market participant buyers would be prepared to\npay for the subject asset. The Board considers that, if a not-for-profit market participant buyer would be\nwilling to pay more for an asset, if necessary, than the amount reflecting the net cash inflows the asset could\ngenerate (which might occur if the subject asset (e.g. a specialised asset) is not available in the market for a\nprice reflecting its cash-generating ability), measuring the asset at that higher amount would not introduce\nnon-financial influences into the concept of financial feasibility. In such a case, hypothetical market\nparticipant buyers would be willing to pay a cash price for the asset exceeding the amount on which a\ncommercial return may be generated, because of non-commercial benefits they can derive. If the subject\nasset is not available in the market for a price reflecting its cash-generating ability, and in the circumstances\nthat asset is measured using the cost approach based on acquisition for its highest and best use (including\ndeductions for any obsolescence), its fair value measurement would not involve non-financial influences,\nbecause paragraph B9 of AASB 13 stipulates that current replacement cost does not exceed the amount for\nwhich a market participant buyer could replace the asset\u2019s service capacity.  \nBC86 In response to the stakeholder\u2019s question noted in paragraph BC84(b), the Board observes that the\nmodifications to AASB 13 set out in this Standard, including the modification of the guidance on\n\u2018financially feasible use\u2019 in paragraph Aus28.1, do not indicate that the income approach cannot be applied\nwhen measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held\nprimarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows. The entity uses judgement in determining which\nvaluation technique (or combination of techniques) to apply, considering all facts and circumstances and the\navailability of observable inputs relevant to the subject asset.  \nBC87 The stakeholder also requested the Board to provide illustrative examples of how to apply paragraph\nAus28.1, including where the asset does, or does not, have the potential to derive income. The Board\ndeclined that request because:  \n(a) paragraph Aus28.1 proposes a simple amendment to replace:  \n(i) assessing whether an asset\u2019s use would generate an investment return on an investment\nin that asset, with  \n(ii) assessing whether market participants would be willing to invest in the asset\u2019s service\ncapacity. This would be largely dependent on whether the asset provides essential (or\nhighly desired) goods or services to beneficiaries of either the entity or a similar notfor-profit public sector market participant buyer hypothetically bidding for the asset,\nwhich typically would be the case for assets within the scope of this Amending\nStandard;  \n(b) the illustrative examples on IFRS 13 do not include illustrative examples on \u2018financially feasible\nuse\u2019; and  \n(c) neither (i) nor (ii) above involves estimating fair values (instead, \u2018financially feasible use\u2019 is a\nfactor in developing fair value estimates).  \nBC88 The Board also observed that, where the market or income approach is used, there should be no change to\nhow financially feasible use would be assessed in light of paragraph Aus28.1.",

        "page_content=": "### Interaction with functional obsolescence\nBC89 During the outreach related to the Fatal-Flaw Review draft Standard, a stakeholder questioned the\ninteraction between the proposed paragraph Aus28.1 and functional obsolescence. With the introduction of\na new financially feasible use concept in proposed paragraph Aus28.1 focused, in part, on the cost of\nproviding goods or services, the stakeholder commented it is unclear whether a subject asset having excess\noperating costs compared with a modern equivalent reference asset might cause:  \n-----  (a) the subject asset\u2019s current use to be considered financially infeasible after considering functional\nobsolescence; and  \n(b) if the subject asset is measured under the cost approach, the concept of functional obsolescence to\nbe considered inapplicable because determining whether a use of the asset is \u2018financially feasible\u2019\nhas regard to the resulting cost of goods or services the asset provides and therefore the amount\nmarket participants would be willing to invest in the asset\u2019s service capacity.  \nBC90 Paragraph 80.6 of International Valuation Standard IVS 105 Valuation Approaches and Methods provides\ninternational valuation standards guidance on the two forms of functional obsolescence. It states:  \nThere are two forms of functional obsolescence:  \n(a) excess capital cost, which can be caused by changes in design, materials of\nconstruction, technology or manufacturing techniques resulting in the availability of\nmodern equivalent assets with lower capital costs than the subject asset, and  \n(b) excess operating cost, which can be caused by improvements in design or excess\ncapacity resulting in the availability of modern equivalent assets with lower operating\ncosts than the subject asset.  \nBC91 To explain their concern, the stakeholder provided an example assuming that the subject asset (a building)\nhas in-built halogen lights and the modern equivalent reference asset has in-built LED lights, which are\nmore cost-effective to operate than halogen lights. In this case, paragraph 80.6(b) of IVS 105 would indicate\nthe fair value of the subject asset should be adjusted down to reflect the excess operating costs compared\nwith the modern equivalent asset used as a reference asset. The stakeholder requested the Board to clarify\nwhether, if making such adjustments would result in a small estimated fair value, the asset\u2019s use could still\nbe considered financially feasible under the new proposed paragraph Aus28.1, since it would require\nconsideration of the cost of providing goods or services.  \nBC92 The Board noted that, under proposed paragraph Aus28.1, the cost of providing goods or services would be\na consideration in determining whether market participants would be willing to invest in the asset\u2019s service\ncapacity; the other consideration being the capability of the asset to be used to provide needed goods or\nservices to beneficiaries.  \nBC93 Even if the subject asset is estimated to have a low fair value due to having higher operating costs than the\nmodern equivalent reference asset, if it has been judged that market participants, including other not-forprofit public sector entities, would be willing to invest in the subject asset\u2019s service capacity considering\nalso the capability of the asset to be used to provide needed goods or services to beneficiaries, then the\nasset\u2019s use would be considered financially feasible.  \nBC94 In addition, this Amending Standard would not modify the requirement in paragraph B9 of AASB 13 that,\nwhen the cost approach is applied, the asset\u2019s fair value measurement takes into account physical\ndeterioration, functional (technological) obsolescence and economic (external) obsolescence. An asset\u2019s\ncurrent replacement cost measured in accordance with paragraphs B8 and B9 of AASB 13 would be\nreduced by the effect of functional obsolescence because it reduces the amount market participant buyers\nwould be willing to pay for the asset\u2019s service capacity.  \nBC95 If, for example, an asset is required by a not-for-profit public sector market participant buyer to provide\nneeded goods or services, that market participant buyer would be willing to pay the necessary cost to\nacquire or construct the asset, but no more. In contrast, if a subject asset does not provide essential or highly\ndesired goods or services, it might be concluded in the circumstances that the cost of acquiring or\nconstructing the asset cannot be justified by a not-for-profit public sector market participant buyer.\nDepending on the other facts and circumstances, it might even be concluded that the only financially\nfeasible use of the asset is to hold it for sale (this illustrates one of the reasons why, for assets of not-forprofit public sector entities not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows, the Board\ndecided not to constrain the selection of the market approach, income approach or cost approach).",

The Board noted\nthat:  \n(a) the IASB considered this issue in the context of for-profit entities when developing IFRS 13 (see\nparagraphs BC115 and BC116); however,  \n(b) the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an Agenda Decision _Valuation of biological assets_\n_using a residual method in March 2013. The Agenda Decision concerned biological assets that_\nare physically attached to land, which have no separate market value and are measured at fair\nvalue using a residual method. The Committee noted that \u201cIFRS 13 does not explicitly address\nthe accounting implications if those circumstances arise and the fair value measurement of the\nasset based on its highest and best use assumes that other assets in the group need to be converted\nor destroyed.\u201d The Committee also noted that this issue might affect the accounting for assets in\nthe scope of Standards other than IAS 41 _Agriculture, and for these reasons decided not to_\nundertake a project to address this issue; and  \n(c) this issue is not specific to not-for-profit entities.  \nBC114 Therefore, the Board decided not to develop implementation guidance on this issue. In addition, the Board\nnoted that, since receiving the stakeholder group\u2019s request for guidance noted in paragraph BC113, the\nBoard developed conditions in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 that must be satisfied before potentially\nidentifying a higher and better use of a non-financial asset not held primarily for its ability to generate net\ncash inflows \u2013 specifically, in various circumstances, those conditions might nullify the premise of the\nquestion that the assets\u2019 current use is not their highest and best use. For an alternative feasible use of land\nand buildings currently used for a community purpose to potentially be identified as the highest and best use\nof those assets (thus potentially implying that the buildings have a fair value of nil), it would be necessary to\nmeet the criteria in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 for considering whether an asset\u2019s current use is not its\nhighest and best use. If those criteria are met, the discussion in paragraphs BC115\u2013BC119 would be\nrelevant.  \nBC115 In relation to this issue generally, paragraphs BC72 and BC73 of the IASB\u2019s Basis for Conclusions for\nIFRS 13 use an example of a factory. Paragraph BC72 states that \u201cThe IASB concluded when developing\nthe exposure draft [of IFRS 13] that measuring the factory at nil would not provide useful information when\nan entity is using that factory in its operations. In particular, users would want to see depreciation on that\nfactory so that they could assess the economic resources consumed in generating cash flows from its\noperation.\u201d Prior to finalising IFRS 13, the IASB had exposed a proposed requirement for an entity to\nseparate the fair value of the asset group into its current use and fair value components.  \nBC116 However, after considering responses from its stakeholders that preparing separate valuations for each asset\nin the group of assets would be costly, the IASB noted in paragraph BC73 of the IASB\u2019s Basis for\nConclusions for IFRS 13 that \u201c\u2026 when an entity uses a non-financial asset in a way that differs from its\nhighest and best use (and that asset is measured at fair value), the entity must simply disclose that fact and\nwhy the asset is being used in a manner that differs from its highest and best use.\u201d That disclosure\nrequirement is stated in IFRS 13 paragraph 93(i).  \nBC117 Therefore, when the highest and best use of land and improvements collectively within a group of assets of\na not-for-profit public sector entity not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows is different\nfrom their current use by the entity (after applying the principle in paragraphs Aus29.1 and Aus29.2 that an\nentity is required to consider whether an alternative use of an asset is the asset\u2019s highest and best use only\nwhen either the asset is classified as held for sale or held for distribution to owners in accordance with\nAASB 5 or it is highly probable that the asset will be used for an alternative purpose), the entity would\nnonetheless conform to the general principle that each asset\u2019s fair value is based on its highest and best use  \n-----  (which may mean that the factory in the IASB\u2019s example would be measured at nil), but include a\ndisclosure note explaining why the asset is being used in a manner that differs from its highest and best use,\nin accordance with paragraph 93(i) of AASB 13.  \nBC118 The Board noted that paragraph 31(a)(iii) of AASB 13 states that: \u201cassumptions about the highest and best\nuse of a non-financial asset shall be consistent for all the assets (for which highest and best use is relevant)\nof the group of assets or the group of assets and liabilities within which the asset would be used.\u201d In relation\nto the question from the group of stakeholders noted in paragraph BC113, the Board noted a view that,\nconsistent with paragraph 31(a)(iii) of AASB 13, it would be inappropriate for land and its improvements to\nhave two different highest and best use assumptions if they are used in combination to maximise value to\nmarket participants.  \nBC119 The Board also noted that paragraph 17 of AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements states that to\nachieve a fair presentation of financial statements, an entity is required to \u201c\u2026 provide additional disclosures\nwhen compliance with the specific requirements in Australian Accounting Standards is insufficient to\nenable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity\u2019s\nfinancial position and financial performance.\u201d The Board noted a view that, if an entity considers the\ncurrent value of those improvements based on their current use and periodic depreciation is important to\nusers of financial statements, it would consider whether it should disclose this information to comply with\nparagraph 17 of AASB 101.",

This is because the services provided by such an asset sometimes are unique; and therefore,\nthey argued that:  \n(a) there would not be a private sector entity, another government or another not-for-profit public\nsector entity that would provide such services; and, in turn,  \n(b) there would not be another identifiable market participant for many assets held by not-for-profit\npublic sector entities. Therefore, the market selling price of many such assets, or of identical\nassets, is unlikely to be directly observable.  \nBC122 The Board noted that paragraph 23 of AASB 13 states that an entity need not identify specific market\nparticipants, reflecting the focus of paragraph 22 of AASB 13 on the assumptions that market participants\nwould use when pricing the asset. An entity estimates the pricing assumptions that other market participants\n(ie market participants other than the holder of the asset) would use by maximising the use of relevant\nobservable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.  \nBC123 The Board observed that many not-for-profit public sector entity assets not held primarily for their ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows are used in combination with other assets rather than on a stand-alone basis. As\ndiscussed in paragraphs BC54\u2013BC55, the IASB noted in paragraphs BC78 and BC79 of its Basis for\nConclusions on IFRS 13 that sometimes an observed market price \u2013 one for sale of an asset on a stand-alone\nbasis \u2013 will not reflect an asset\u2019s fair value (because it does not reflect the value that the asset contributes to\nthe entity, which is achieved by using the asset in combination with other assets). The IASB noted that fair\nvalue measurement for such an asset should assume that the market participant buyer steps into the shoes of\nthe entity holding the subject asset.  \nBC124 Therefore, consistent with the IASB\u2019s view, the Board considered that when measuring the fair value of a\nnon-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity (the subject asset), market participants for the\nsubject asset would include other not-for-profit public sector entities because they represent market\nparticipant buyers that hypothetically \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of the not-for-profit public sector entity holding\nthe subject asset. That is, the entity considers the assumptions other not-for-profit public sector entities\nwould use when pricing the subject asset. The Board observed that the majority of respondents to ED 320\nwho commented on this topic agreed with this view.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Developing unobservable inputs (paragraphs F3\u2013F7)  \nBC125 In light of the stakeholder comment that many non-financial assets of not-for-profit public sector entities\nnot held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows are unique to the holder of the asset and\nanother identifiable market participant for the asset would be unlikely to exist (ie the entity would be\nunlikely to find observable inputs for measuring the fair value of such unique assets), the Board considered\nthat the holder of those assets would need to develop at least some unobservable inputs in order to measure\nthe fair value of those assets.  \nBC126 In relation to developing unobservable inputs, paragraph 89 of AASB 13 states that:  \nAn entity shall develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the\ncircumstances, which might include the entity\u2019s own data. In developing unobservable inputs, an\n**entity may begin with its own data, but it shall** **adjust those data if reasonably available**\n**information indicates that other market participants would use different data or there is**\nsomething particular to the entity that is not available to other market participants (eg an entityspecific synergy). An entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information about\nmarket participant assumptions. However, an entity shall take into account all information about\nmarket participant assumptions that is reasonably available. Unobservable inputs developed in\n**the manner described above are considered market participant assumptions and meet the**\n**objective of a fair value measurement. [emphasis added]**  \nBC127 Paragraph 89 of AASB 13 permits the use of an entity\u2019s own data in developing unobservable inputs. In\nrelation to applying the principle noted in paragraph BC122, the Board decided to add implementation\nguidance clarifying paragraph 89 of AASB 13 by:  \n(a) re-expressing the requirements of that paragraph, so that an entity\u2019s own assumptions are required\nto be used at a starting point if some relevant information about other market participant\nassumptions needed to estimate the fair value of the asset is not reasonably available;  \n(b) retaining the requirement for a not-for-profit public sector entity to adjust its own data if\nreasonably available information indicates that other market participants would use different data\nor there is something particular to the entity that is not available to other market participants (eg\nan entity-specific synergy). This would preclude an entity from using its own unadjusted data\nwhere those data are inconsistent with reasonably available information about the inputs that\nother market participants (eg other not-for-profit public sector entities, such as other local\ngovernments) would use in pricing the asset; and  \n(c) replicating the statement in paragraph 89 of AASB 13 that an entity need not undertake\nexhaustive efforts to obtain information about other market participant assumptions.  \nBC128 In relation to paragraph BC127(b), the use of data about the inputs that other not-for-profit public sector\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset is based on the hypothetical assumption that such market\nparticipants would acquire the not-for-profit public sector reporting entity\u2019s assets; it is not necessary that\nsuch an acquisition will actually occur. Where other not-for-profit public sector entities have comparable\nassets, information reasonably available to valuers about those assets enables valuers to assess whether\nother market participants would use different data from the entity\u2019s own data.  \nBC129 Adding paragraphs F5\u2013F7 to AASB 13 is justified in accordance with paragraphs 24(a)(iii) and 30(h) of the\n_AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework, to reduce the potential for confusion regarding_\nwhen the search for assumptions of other market participants ends, and in turn reduce the cost and effort\nrequired to identify which market participant assumptions to use in measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets of not-for-profit public sector entities not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash\ninflows. This is because, unlike paragraph 89 of AASB 13, paragraphs F5 and F6 state that:  \n(a) if some data of other market participants to measure the fair value of an asset are not observable,\nthe entity uses its own assumptions as a starting point and adjusts them to the extent that\nreasonably available information indicates that other market participants would use different data;\nand  \n(b) to the extent that relevant information about the assumptions of other market participants is not\nreasonably available, the entity would use its own data to estimate the fair value of the asset\nwithout the need to incur exhaustive efforts to identify other market participant data.  \nBC130 In addition, paragraphs F5\u2013F7 should be clearer and more straight forward to apply than paragraph 89 of\nAASB 13 alone, by treating the reasonable availability of other market participant data as a criterion for\namending the entity\u2019s own assumptions, thus stipulating a process with two distinct steps. Paragraph 89 of\nAASB 13 refers to an entity needing to take into account all information about market participant  \n-----  assumptions that is reasonably available, without indicating the sequence in which that information would\nbe taken into account if an entity uses its own data as part of estimating an asset\u2019s fair value.  \nBC131 The Board noted that respondents to ED 320 generally supported the Board\u2019s proposed guidance, and\ndecided to confirm that guidance with some editing for greater clarity.  \nBC132 The Board observed that some stakeholders commented that infrastructure (eg roads, drainage and sewerage\nworks), parliament houses, fire stations, police stations, war memorials, traffic or pedestrian facilities, and\ncommunity facilities (eg toilet blocks) are typical assets for which information about other market\nparticipant assumptions often would neither be reasonably available nor indicate that those assumptions\ndiffer from the entity\u2019s own assumptions. However, the Board concluded it will depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each non-financial asset whether it exhibits neither of these characteristics.  \nBC133 The Board also considered a request from ED 320 respondents for clarification of whether the proposed\nrequirement to measure an asset\u2019s fair value using the entity\u2019s own assumptions as a starting point would\napply on a whole-of-asset basis or on a per-input basis to a fair value estimate. The Board decided to clarify\nin paragraph F7 that, when some inputs to a fair value estimate are observable market data and other inputs\nare unobservable, the unobservable inputs would be used for part of the asset\u2019s fair value estimate.\nParagraph F7 provides an example of a self-constructed specialised facility, the land component of which\nhas comparable land with an observable market price. If entity-specific data are needed to measure the fair\nvalue of some or all of the improvements on that land, those entity-specific data would be included in the\nfair value estimate for the facility together with observable data about market participant assumptions for\nother components of the facility.",

        "page_content=": "## Assumed location of an asset when applying the cost approach (paragraph F11(a))  \nBC139 This issue relates to an asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held primarily for its ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows and measured under the cost approach (eg a public school or public hospital). This\nissue mainly concerns the fair value measurement of real property.  \nBC140 The Board was asked to clarify whether the location of the real property being valued should necessarily be\nthe property\u2019s existing location, particularly in view of the principle that an asset\u2019s current replacement cost\nreflects replacement in the most economical manner. For example, if a facility could deliver its services\nequally well in a nearby location with cheaper land, the Board was asked whether it be assumed that \u201cthe\ncost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility\u201d (as\nreferred to in paragraph B9 of AASB 13) reflects the price of the facility in the cheaper location.  \nBC141 For the reasons described in paragraph BC155, a fair value estimate is based on an assumed hypothetical\nexchange transaction by considering data about a reference asset. Some stakeholders argued that the\nfacility\u2019s fair value estimate should reflect the price of suitable property in a cheaper feasible location (the\narguably suitable reference property) because a market participant buyer would not be willing to pay for an\nasset at a more expensive location, if the facility could deliver its services equally well in a nearby location\nwith cheaper land. They argued that applying the generally accepted principle that an asset\u2019s current\nreplacement cost is measured on an optimised basis typically by reference to the price of a modern\nequivalent asset, the modern equivalent asset would be a nearby asset in a cheaper location.  \nBC142 These stakeholders argued that the market value premium of property in its existing location over a suitable\nalternative location is a commercial element superfluous to the entity\u2019s not-for-profit (service delivery)\nobjectives. They note that their view is consistent with the following text of The Royal Institution of\nChartered Surveyors\u2019 Guidance Note _Depreciated replacement cost method of valuation for financial_\n_reporting (November 2018):[1]_  \nAlthough the ultimate objective of the DRC method is to produce a valuation of the actual\nproperty in its actual location, the initial stage of estimating the gross replacement cost should\nreflect the cost of a site suitable for a modern equivalent facility. While this may be a site of a\nsimilar size and in a similar location to the actual site, if the actual site is clearly one that a\nprudent buyer would no longer consider appropriate because it would be commercially wasteful\nor would be an inappropriate use of resources, the modern equivalent site is assumed to have the\nappropriate characteristics to deliver the required service potential. The fundamental principle is\nthat the hypothetical buyer for a modern equivalent asset would purchase the least expensive site\nthat would realistically be suitable and appropriate for its proposed operations and the envisaged\nmodern equivalent facility. \u2026 (paragraph 7.1)  \n\u2026 An example could be a hospital that was originally constructed in the centre of a city that\nmight now be better situated in the suburbs because of changes in the transport infrastructure or in\nthe migration of the population it served. (paragraph 7.2)  \nBC143 In contrast, some other stakeholders argued that the current replacement cost of real property should always\nreflect the property\u2019s existing location, rather than the price of land in a cheaper feasible site. This is\nbecause the land\u2019s characteristics include its location, and the price premium for the existing site (compared\nwith a cheaper feasible site) could be realised through sale and reinvested in other assets used to provide\nservices. For example, the Application Guidance included in the New Zealand Accounting Standard for\nPublic Benefit Entities entitled PBE IPSAS 17 Property, Plant and Equipment states that:  \nIf depreciated replacement cost is used to measure the fair value of property, plant and\nequipment: (a) The value of the land shall reflect the fair value of the actual land held, in terms of\nboth its size and location; \u2026 (paragraph AG2)  \nIn instances where land is underutilised, the fair value of the land shall be determined by\nreference to the highest and best use of such land. For example, in a case where specialised\nfacilities are located in a prime central business district site but the operation would be able to run\nfrom a smaller sized and/or less valuable alternative site offering the same service potential, the\nfair value of the land would be the market value of the entire central business district-located site.\n(paragraph AG9)  \n1 This Guidance Note is not explicitly identified as applying to fair value measurements, or non-fair value measurements, using\ndepreciated replacement cost. However, paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 of the Guidance Note refer to depreciated replacement cost being used\nin relation to the \u2018cost approach\u2019 to valuation, and to the market and income approaches as the other principal approaches to valuation,\nimplying the Guidance Note would be relevant to fair value measurements (even if not exclusively).  \n-----  BC144 Similarly, some stakeholders argued that, from the perspective of market participants, the property in a\nmore expensive location provides superior services. For example, an office space in a central business\ndistrict location provides greater service capacity than office space in an inner suburb by having greater\nproximity to stakeholders and urban infrastructure, and by assisting the entity to attract and retain staff.\nThese stakeholders are also of the view that if the property\u2019s service capacity can be relocated to another\nlocation, then the highest and best use of the current property is not limited to its existing use; and therefore,\nshould be valued at its current location, reflecting its highest and best use.  \nBC145 Having regard to these conflicting views, the Board noted that it could theoretically be argued that the\ncurrent replacement cost of an item of real property of a not-for-profit public sector entity should be\nmeasured as follows:  \n(a) if the real property needs to remain in its existing location due to legal restrictions or operational\nrequirements, the property\u2019s current replacement cost should be based on replacement in the\nexisting location; and  \n(b) if the real property does not need to remain in its existing location, the property\u2019s current\nreplacement cost should be measured in the location that results in the higher of the following\nmeasures:  \n(i) the price a market participant would be prepared to pay to remove the improvements\nand then sell the property as a vacant site for an alternative use \u2013 reflecting the\nproperty\u2019s existing location. This is because an asset\u2019s fair value can never be less than\nthe price for which that asset could be sold at the measurement date (excluding\ntransaction costs); and  \n(ii) the price a market participant would be prepared to pay to replace the service capacity\nof the land and improvements in their existing use in the most economical manner. This\namount would include the market price of land in the cheapest legally permissible\nlocation compatible with the entity\u2019s operational requirements for the facility. This is\nbecause, as an alternative to purchasing the asset subject to measurement, a market\nparticipant would build a modern equivalent property in an alternative site, if it would\nbe cheaper than purchasing the asset in its existing location.  \nBC146 However, on further deliberation, the Board observed that the approach described in paragraph BC145\nwould have the following disadvantages:  \n(a) it is inconsistent with the view, which the Board supports, that the current replacement cost of\nreal property should always be measured in its existing location because the service capacity of a\nproperty being replaced is the sum of:  \n(i) its capacity to provide services in its current use; and  \n(ii) its residual value (the present value of the net cash inflows from sale of the property at\nthe end of the useful life of the improvements on the land), including the subsequent\nsale of the land component of the property (at its existing location). An asset\u2019s residual\nvalue contributes to the entity\u2019s capacity to provide services (and thus, indirectly, is\nanother component of the existing asset\u2019s service capacity);  \n(b) it is unnecessarily complex. It would generally be very difficult to identify which location, of a\npotential variety of alternative locations with possibly significantly different market prices of\nland, might be used as the assumed alternative location; and  \n(c) it would be time-consuming and costly for preparers and auditors of financial statements. The\nadditional cost of potentially preparing multiple valuations and due diligence assessments would\nbe unlikely to be justified by the benefits to users of the financial statements.  \nBC147 In light of the concerns in paragraph BC146, the Board concluded that the current replacement cost of an\nasset, including real property, of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held primarily for its ability to\ngenerate net cash inflows should be measured by assuming the asset is replaced in its existing location, even\nif it would be feasible to relocate the asset to a cheaper location. The Board noted that respondents to\nED 320 strongly supported the Board\u2019s view, and decided to add paragraph F11(a) to Appendix F of\nAASB 13.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "## Nature of costs included in current replacement cost (paragraphs F8\u2013 F15)  \nBC148 The Board was asked to clarify which costs should be included in the current replacement cost of an asset\nheld by a not-for-profit public sector entity when applying the cost approach under paragraphs B8\u2013B9 of\nAASB 13, particularly where such an asset is constructed by or on behalf of the entity (ie not replaced in a\nsingle transaction). Specifically, stakeholders requested the Board to clarify whether the following costs\nshould (among other costs) be included in the current replacement cost of the asset subject to measurement\n(the subject asset):  \n(a) costs of parts of an asset not expected to actually be replaced in the future, because they are not\nexpected to wear out, but that would need to be incurred in a hypothetical acquisition or\nconstruction of the subject asset by a market participant buyer;  \n(b) site preparation costs, including costs of removal and disposal of unwanted existing structures on\nland; and  \n(c) intrinsically linked disruption costs, including costs of restoring another entity\u2019s asset that would\nbe disrupted in a hypothetical replacement of the subject asset (the nature of disruption costs is\nexplained in paragraph BC179).  \nBC149 Stakeholders also requested the Board to clarify, when identifying the component costs to include in an\nasset\u2019s current replacement cost, whether it should always be assumed that the asset would be replaced in\nthe most economical manner, even if the entity would, in its ordinary course of operations, be required to\nincur additional costs.  \nBC150 The majority of respondents to ED 320 expressed in-principle support for most of the proposed\nimplementation guidance on the nature of the costs to include in the current replacement cost of an asset,\nbut also expressed concerns about the practical challenges of applying that proposed guidance. The Board\nconsidered the feedback and revised the guidance to address those concerns.  \nBC151 In particular, the Board observed that respondents\u2019 concerns about the difficulty of identifying and\nmeasuring some costs are mainly related to assets within the scope of the guidance in paragraph 89 of\nAASB 13 \u2013 when the market selling price of a comparable asset and at least some other market participant\ndata are not observable. The Board added paragraph F5 to require an entity to use its own assumptions as a\nstarting point and adjust them only to the extent that reasonably available information indicates that other\nmarket participants would use different data. In addition, the Board decided to provide a practical expedient\nin paragraph F14 whereby an entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information about the\ncosts referred to in paragraph BC148, provided that the entity includes all such costs for which data are\nreasonably available.  \nBC152 The Board also considered the feedback that identifying an asset\u2019s current replacement cost as including the\ncosts referred to in paragraph BC148 might require an entity to recognise and measure separately some\nassets at a considerably more disaggregated level, resulting in increased cost and effort. For example,\nconcerns were expressed that greater disaggregation might become necessary for costs to restore assets of\nother entities disturbed upon replacement of the subject asset, because those restoration costs would vary\nconsiderably according to location-specific factors. The Board observed that the implementation guidance\non the application of the cost approach does not preclude the use of unit rates or standard costing\nmethodologies that approximate the total amounts of individual assets, particularly in applying the concept\nof materiality. Similarly, the implementation guidance does not mandate the unit of account for assets\nmeasured at fair value by applying the cost approach.",

        "page_content=": "## The overarching principle  \nBC153 The definition of fair value in paragraph 9 of AASB 13 refers to the price that would be received to sell an\nasset (ie exit price). However, when the best evidence of a subject asset\u2019s fair value (maximising the use of\nrelevant observable inputs) is not data about that asset\u2019s selling price or net cash inflows from use (and\ntherefore the cost approach is applied), the asset\u2019s fair value is derived by regard to the asset\u2019s market\n_buying price (often the sum of a number of purchase prices for the asset\u2019s parts). In relation to applying the_\ncost approach, paragraph B9 of AASB 13 states that: \u201cFrom the perspective of a market participant seller,\nthe price that would be received for the asset is based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or\nconstruct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. That is because a market\nparticipant buyer would not pay more for an asset than the amount for which it could replace the service\ncapacity of that asset.\u201d  \nBC154 In this regard, the price a market participant buyer would be prepared to pay for a subject asset is estimated\nby reflecting the fact that the market participant buyer presently does not possess the subject asset and needs  \n-----  to acquire or construct it in its entirety. The Board concluded that, to estimate this amount, an entity would\ninclude all necessary costs intrinsically linked to acquiring or constructing the asset at the measurement\ndate. This is because a market participant buyer of the subject asset would need to incur all those costs if it\nacquired or constructed the subject asset at the measurement date, whether that buyer hypothetically\nacquires the subject asset from the entity or constructs a substitute asset itself.  \nBC155 Because the subject asset is held by the reporting entity at the measurement date, an actual sale of the\nsubject asset by the reporting entity to a market participant buyer did not occur on the measurement date.\nConsequently, as noted in IFRS 13 paragraph BC30, the definition of fair value assumes a hypothetical\nexchange transaction. Assuming a hypothetical acquisition or construction of a substitute asset by the\nmarket participant buyer requires the consideration of data about a reference asset. Therefore, an estimate of\nan asset\u2019s current replacement cost includes all necessary costs intrinsically linked to hypothetically\nacquiring or constructing a reference asset at the measurement date. The process of identifying and using\ndata about reference assets, while maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use\nof unobservable inputs, is discussed in paragraphs BC157\u2013BC161.  \nBC156 ED 320 proposed the concept of \u201cassuming the subject asset presently does not exist\u201d as the overarching\nprinciple of the cost approach. The Board proposed that assumption as \u2018shorthand\u2019 for the principle that the\nmarket participant buyer presently does not possess the subject asset and needs to acquire that asset in its\nentirety. However, a few respondents commented that the concept that the subject asset presently does not\nexist conflicts with the proposed requirements to include certain asset-specific costs in current replacement\ncost. The Board decided not to state an overarching principle for the cost approach in the implementation\nguidance because paragraphs B8 and B9 clearly state that the cost approach reflects the amount that would\nbe required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset, which requires all necessary costs\nintrinsically linked to the hypothetical acquisition or replacement of a reference asset to be included in the\nsubject asset\u2019s current replacement cost.",

Paragraph\n70.5 of IVS 105 describes a modern equivalent asset as an asset \u201c\u2026 that provides similar function and\nequivalent utility to the asset being valued, but which is of a current design and constructed or made using\ncurrent cost-effective materials and techniques.\u201d  \nBC159 Paragraph 70.6 of IVS 105 states that using the reproduction cost method (ie the reference asset is a replica\nof the subject asset) to measure the value of the subject asset is appropriate in circumstances such as the\nfollowing:  \n(a) the cost of a modern equivalent asset is greater than the cost of recreating a replica of the subject\nasset; or  \n(b) the utility offered by the subject asset could be provided only by a replica rather than a modern\nequivalent.  \nBC160 Some respondents to ED 320 argued that the implementation guidance should stipulate that a modern\nequivalent asset should be used as a reference asset only where a replica of the subject asset is unavailable.\nThe Board disagreed with that suggestion because:  \n(a) if the current service capacity of an asset can be replaced more economically by a modern\nequivalent asset, it would be unlikely that a market participant buyer would be willing to pay the\nhigher cost of a replica; and  \n(b) it would make AASB 13 more restrictive than IVS 105 and thus provide guidance on matters\nrelating to detailed valuation assessments, which does not belong within the scope of an\nAustralian Accounting Standard.  \nBC161 A few ED respondents argued that, for heritage assets held for their heritage significance, their replacement\ncost should be based on replication of the original heritage design but using modern cost-effective materials  \n-----  and processes (which are aspects of a modern equivalent asset).

        "page_content=": "## Costs of parts of assets that will not actually require replacement  \nBC162 The Board was requested to provide guidance on whether an asset\u2019s current replacement cost should\nexclude costs of any parts of the asset that will not actually require replacement in the future because their\nservice capacity does not expire over time (ie \u2018once-only costs\u2019). This issue has been the subject of debate\nand inconsistent practice (for example, the current replacement cost of some roads has been estimated by\nexcluding the cost of design work, earthworks and formation costs because those components do not wear\nout or become otherwise obsolete, and therefore do not require replacement in the future).  \nBC163 The Board concluded it would be inappropriate to exclude any costs from an estimate of an asset\u2019s current\nreplacement cost on the grounds that they relate to parts of an asset that are not expected to actually be\nreplaced in the future. For the reasons described in paragraphs BC153\u2013BC155, an estimate of an asset\u2019s\ncurrent replacement cost should include all necessary costs intrinsically linked to hypothetically acquiring\nor constructing a reference asset at the measurement date, reflecting that the hypothetical acquisition or\nconstruction costs are incurred by a market participant buyer that does not possess the subject asset at the\nmeasurement date.  \nBC164 Current replacement cost assumes hypothetical replacement or reconstruction of a reference asset, and is not\nlimited to costs of replacements the entity expects to incur in the future (which is a matter of budgeting\nrather than measurement of existing resources). To exclude any costs from an estimate of an asset\u2019s current\nreplacement cost on the grounds that they relate to parts of an asset that are not expected to actually be\nreplaced in the future would imply that the fair value of an asset measured under the cost approach would\nbe zero if, at the measurement date, the holder of the asset expects the asset neither to be replaced at the end\nof its useful life nor to have components replaced during its remaining useful life.  \nBC165 One respondent to ED 320 and some other stakeholders requested clarification of the \u2018starting point\u2019 for\nidentifying once-only costs. For example, they commented that the \u2018starting point\u2019 that should be the focus\nof measuring the current replacement cost of parts of an asset could be the conditions prevailing at the site\nof the subject asset when it was initially acquired or constructed (but with the resulting costs measured\nusing prices current at the measurement date), a vacant site with all site preparation works completed, or\nsome other as-yet undefined point.  \nBC166 The Board considers that this question has conceptual and practical dimensions. From a conceptual\nviewpoint, paragraphs B8 and B9 of AASB 13 state that the cost approach to measuring an asset\u2019s fair value\nreflects the amount that would be required _currently to replace the asset\u2019s service capacity. Therefore, in_\nconcept, the \u2018starting point\u2019 for considering the costs to include in an asset\u2019s current replacement cost is the\ncurrent conditions (including market conditions and current operating environment) of the subject asset at\nthe measurement date, estimated using a reference asset as input.  \nBC167 From a practical viewpoint, the entity might have limited information about some of the costs required\ncurrently to replace the service capacity of a reference asset. Although some costs to acquire or construct\nparts of an asset often have industry-wide data available to assist their estimation (eg costs of drainage\npipes), some other parts of assets have costs that tend to be site-specific, and it may be necessary to use\nhistorical data retained by the holder of the subject asset. This can present practical difficulties, especially\nfor costs of any parts that have not been incurred in recent years.  \nBC168 The Board concluded that an entity should not need to undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information\nabout the costs composing an asset\u2019s current replacement cost; however, an entity includes all such costs for\nwhich data are reasonably available. That is, under paragraph F14, if data about certain costs of some parts\nof an asset are not reasonably available, those costs would be omitted from an estimate of the subject asset\u2019s\ncurrent replacement cost. However, those costs are not omitted simply because they relate to parts of an\nasset that are not expected to actually be replaced in the future.",

        "page_content=": "## Site preparation costs  \nBC169 Entities would need to apply judgement in the circumstances of the subject asset to determine the necessary\ncosts intrinsically linked to acquiring or constructing the asset at the measurement date. For an asset fixed to\na parcel of land, this would include whether it would be necessary for the market participant to incur site\npreparation costs in order to hypothetically construct a reference asset at the subject asset\u2019s location.  \nBC170 For example, to measure the current replacement cost of a building, an entity would consider whether a\nmarket participant buyer would be able to acquire a vacant site in the area surrounding the existing location.\nIf suitable vacant sites are available, market participants would be unlikely to pay for the current cost to  \n-----  demolish existing structures on the site (and, therefore, it would be unlikely that such a cost would be\nconsidered \u2018necessarily incurred\u2019). Similarly, if market participants are able to acquire a suitable parcel of\nland with an existing structure that they could modify as necessary to create a modern equivalent of the\nsubject asset, it would be unnecessary to remove and dispose of existing structures on the reference parcel\nof land. If there are no suitable alternative sites for a particular facility because the facility must be sited in\nits existing location, market participant buyers would be prepared to pay the location-specific costs of site\npreparation for that facility.  \nBC171 The costs included in an asset\u2019s current replacement cost, as a measure of the amount a market participant\nbuyer would be prepared to pay for the asset, represent the costs avoided by a market participant buyer as a\nresult of the entity possessing the service capacity embodied in the subject asset. Consistent with the related\ncomment in paragraph B9 of AASB 13, the market participant buyer is prepared to pay the current amount\nof those costs avoided, and no more. For example, if:  \n(a) instead of acquiring the subject asset, a market participant buyer would have no choice but to\nincur costs to remove and dispose of unwanted existing structures on land as part of the costs to\nconstruct an asset with service capacity equivalent to that of the subject asset (because of a lack\nof suitable vacant sites at the measurement date); and  \n(b) the subject asset (land or improvements, or both) does not have any of those unwanted structures\n(either because the entity removed them or they never existed) and therefore acquiring the subject\nasset would save a market participant buyer from incurring those removal and disposal costs,  \nthose costs to remove and dispose of unwanted existing structures on land would be included in the subject\nasset\u2019s current replacement cost.  \nBC172 Where the conditions in paragraphs BC171(a) and (b) are satisfied, the costs to remove and dispose of\nunwanted existing structures on land would be those of the typical market participant buyer. However, in\naccordance with paragraphs F5, F6 and F14, in the absence of reasonably available observable data about\nthe costs saved by the market participant buyer, the entity would use its own assumptions about the removal\ncosts it would incur if, hypothetically, those unwanted structures existed.  \nBC173 Some ED respondents commented that the fair value of the land on which the subject asset is fixed would,\nin some cases, reflect the fact that it is fit-for-purpose for the subject asset; and therefore, any hypothetical\nsite preparation costs should be excluded from the estimated current replacement cost of fixed\nimprovements on that land to avoid double-counting the site preparation costs. The Board included\nguidance on this issue in paragraph F12(c). An entity may need to apply judgement to determine whether\nnecessarily incurred site preparation costs are reflected (explicitly or implicitly) in the fair value\nmeasurement of a subject parcel of land; where it is unclear whether this is the case, an entity might deem\nthat such costs are reflected in the fair value measurement of the subject parcel of land and therefore\nexclude those costs from the current replacement cost of the subject asset fixed to the land.  \nBC174 A stakeholder provided comment on the circumstance described for Jurisdiction B of Illustrative Example 4\n\u2013 where the entity incurred costs to level the subject site prior to constructing a facility on the site, but\navailable land in the proximity of the subject site was level. The example concluded that a market\nparticipant buyer could hypothetically purchase a level site and therefore the levelling costs should not be\nincluded in the current replacement cost of the subject facility. The stakeholder was concerned that, if an\nentity had incurred site levelling costs (that were capitalised in the facility\u2019s carrying amount), but in a\nsubsequent measurement of the facility, site levelling costs are excluded from the current replacement cost\nof the subject facility, the reduction in the asset\u2019s value would misleadingly indicate that the entity had\nmade an economically unjustified decision in incurring the site levelling costs.  \nBC175 In respect of the stakeholder\u2019s concern noted in paragraph BC174, the Board was informed by some\nstakeholders that, in many cases, if the market approach is applied to measure the value of the land under a\nfacility, any site preparation works incurred would be reflected in the land\u2019s market value. In those cases,\nthe aggregate fair value measurement of the land and facility would not indicate that the necessarily\nincurred site preparation costs are economically unjustified. The particular outcome in Scenario B of\nIllustrative Example 4 reflects a simplified assumption (ie that the value created by site preparation works\naffects the improvements rather than the land). Illustrative examples are included to illustrate particular\naspects and considerations, rather than provide a template for the treatment of particular fact patterns. As\nnoted in paragraph IE1, the evaluations in each illustrative example are not intended to represent the only\nmanner in which AASB 13 could be applied.  \nBC176 Some stakeholders commented that the treatment of costs to remove and dispose of unwanted existing\nstructures on land in order to hypothetically construct a reference asset at the measurement date should be\nconsistent with the treatment of costs of dismantling and removing an item of property, plant and equipment\nand restoring the site on which it is located (paragraph 16 of AASB 116 identifies this latter type of costs as\npart of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment). Those stakeholders commented that if there is  \n-----  no present obligation for an entity to incur costs to remove and dispose of unwanted existing structures on\nland in order to hypothetically construct the subject asset at the measurement date, such costs should not be\nincluded in an asset\u2019s current replacement cost. Some other stakeholders asked for clarification of the\nrelationship between those costs and the costs of dismantling and removing an item of property, plant and\nequipment and restoring the site on which it is located.  \nBC177 The Board observed that, in contrast with costs to remove and dispose of unwanted existing structures on\nland, the costs of dismantling and removing an item of property, plant and equipment and restoring the site\non which it is located are end-of-economic-life costs. Those latter costs would not merit inclusion in the\nasset\u2019s current replacement cost because the market participant buyer of the subject asset logically would\nnot pay for those costs, which in turn is because possessing the subject asset would not save the market\nparticipant buyer from having to incur those end-of-economic-life costs.  \nBC178 However, the Board also observed that Illustrative Example 2 accompanying AASB Interpretation 1\n_Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities states that, if an asset\u2019s valuation_\ndoes not include an amount for these end-of-economic-life costs for which the entity has recognised a\nprovision, the carrying amount of the asset will need to be adjusted by adding back an appropriate amount\nfor the provision (Interpretation 1 paragraph IE7(b)). The IFRS Interpretation Committee\u2019s Basis for\nConclusions on the IFRS Interpretation adopted as AASB Interpretation 1 states that the provision is\naccounted for separately from the valuation of the asset to ensure it is not counted twice (paragraph\nBC25(a)).",

        "page_content=": "## Disruption costs, including costs to restore another entity\u2019s assets  \nBC179 The Board was asked to clarify whether the subject asset\u2019s current replacement cost should include the cost\nto restore another entity\u2019s asset that would be disrupted during the hypothetical construction of the subject\nasset (eg drainage works of another entity disrupted when replacing a road). The Board decided to develop\nproposed guidance on such restoration costs and other disruption costs arising upon the hypothetical\nconstruction of the subject asset; those costs are collectively termed \u2018disruption costs\u2019 in paragraph F12 and\nthis section of the Basis for Conclusions. Examples of disruption costs other than costs of restoring another\nentity\u2019s assets are costs of directing and diverting traffic (including the hire of safety barriers) and costs of\nemploying safety officers.  \nBC180 The key principle underpinning the inclusion of disruption costs (including, but not limited to, costs to\nrestore another entity\u2019s assets that would be disrupted during the hypothetical construction of the subject\nasset) in the current replacement cost of a subject asset is that, as discussed in paragraph BC154, to reflect\nthe pricing assumptions of market participants, a subject asset\u2019s current replacement cost includes all\nnecessary costs intrinsically linked to acquiring or constructing that asset at the measurement date.  \nBC181 The Board considered the following comments expressed by some stakeholders that it would be\ninappropriate to include the cost to restore another entity\u2019s asset in the current replacement cost of an asset\nheld by the entity:  \n(a) because the entity does not control the other entity\u2019s asset that is being restored, it would be\ninappropriate to include in the measurement of the subject asset costs relating to the asset that\nwould be restored;  \n(b) if the entity did not incur those costs when the subject asset was initially constructed, or if those\ndisrupted assets did not exist when the subject asset was initially constructed. This is because\nincluding such restoration costs would increase the subject asset\u2019s fair value simply because of a\nchange in the asset\u2019s operating environment (without the entity having improved the asset\u2019s\nservice capacity), which would not faithfully represent the entity\u2019s performance; and  \n(c) if the other entity is within the same consolidated group as the holder of the subject asset,\nincluding those costs would result in double counting the restoration costs in the consolidated\nfinancial statements for the group. This is because the consolidated financial statements would\ninclude both of the following costs used under the cost approach:  \n(i) the current replacement cost of the disrupted asset of the other entity; and  \n(ii) the current replacement cost of the subject asset, including the costs to restore the other\nentity\u2019s asset.  \nBC182 In relation to the concern noted in paragraph BC181(a), the Board regards such restoration costs as costs of\nobtaining access to the service capacity embodied in the entity\u2019s subject asset. The Board noted that such\ncosts restore, rather than enhance, the disrupted asset and, accordingly, are confined to the consequences of\nacquiring or replacing the entity\u2019s subject asset.  \n-----  BC183 In relation to the concern noted in paragraph BC181(b) about recognition of an increase in an asset\u2019s fair\nvalue without the entity incurring a related cost (and therefore a gain being recognised), the Board noted\nthat these increases are examples of various increases in the market buying prices of components of assets\nthat continue to be held by the entity and do not involve a related cost to the entity. The Board considered\nthat a market participant would be willing to pay more for an asset due to the change in the asset\u2019s operating\nenvironment, despite the asset\u2019s service capacity to produce outputs not having improved. This is because\nall costs to restore another entity\u2019s asset would necessarily be incurred by a market participant if it were to\nacquire or construct the subject asset at the measurement date. Those additional restoration costs are\nnecessarily incurred to obtain access to the services the subject asset is expected to generate. Similarly, a\nmarket participant would consider the costs currently avoided by possessing the subject asset; these costs\nare not limited to those already incurred by the entity or to restoration costs that would have been incurred\nto initially acquire or construct the asset.  \nBC184 The Board agrees with the concern noted in paragraph BC181(c) that the consolidated financial statements\nof the group to which the entity belongs would be overstated if both the disrupted asset and the subject asset\nare measured at their current replacement cost and included in the consolidated financial statements.\nTherefore, the Board decided that the current replacement cost of the subject asset should exclude any costs\nthat hypothetically would be incurred to restore assets of an entity within the same consolidated group as\nthe holder of the subject asset.  \nBC185 In reaching that decision noted in paragraph BC184 about the double-counting issue described in paragraph\nBC181(c), the Board considered whether, instead, it would be appropriate to exclude such restoration costs\nfrom current replacement cost, on the grounds of simplicity, for all non-financial assets of not-for-profit\npublic sector entities not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows. However, the Board\ndecided against this approach because feedback from some stakeholders (in particular, local governments)\nsupported including restoration costs for another entity\u2019s assets \u2013 consistent with local governments not\nbeing identified as entities included in a group of entities that prepares consolidated financial statements.  \nBC186 The Board acknowledged that the proposed exclusion of such restoration costs for assets of entities within\nthe consolidated group to which the holder of the subject asset belongs would depart from the conceptual\nprinciple that an individual entity\u2019s assets are accounted for by reflecting the entity\u2019s perspective (rather\nthan the perspective of the group). The Board considered that a more conceptual variation of the approach\nnoted in paragraph BC184 would be to provide guidance that such restoration costs are included in an\nindividual entity\u2019s financial statements where the entity is part of a group of entities that prepares\nconsolidated financial statements, but eliminated on consolidation. However, in view of the cost involved in\ntracking such restoration costs at each measurement date, only to omit those restoration costs from the\nconsolidated financial statements for the group, the Board considers that the costs of applying that more\nconceptual variation would be likely to outweigh the benefits of that approach.  \nBC187 Paragraph F12(a) does not require including in the subject asset\u2019s current replacement cost any costs to\nrestore other assets of the same entity that would be disrupted in a hypothetical construction of the subject\nasset. This is because including those costs would double count them in fair value measurements of the\nentity\u2019s assets. If those other assets controlled by the entity are measured under the cost approach, their\ncurrent replacement cost would include all costs of constructing them (or paying another entity to construct\nthem) in their entirety. Therefore, the sum of the current replacement costs of each of the entity\u2019s assets\nshould exclude any restoration costs relating to the entity\u2019s own assets.",

The stakeholder commented that, if calibration were required, the\nestimate of an asset\u2019s current replacement cost would be calibrated in such a manner that the estimate\nreflects actual transaction prices (ie excludes any cost components not yet incurred by the entity, such as\nthose hypothetical costs to restore another entity\u2019s assets described above). Paragraph 64 of AASB 13 states\nthat:  \nIf the transaction price is fair value at initial recognition and a valuation technique that uses\nunobservable inputs will be used to measure fair value in subsequent periods, the valuation\ntechnique shall be calibrated so that at initial recognition the result of the valuation technique\nequals the transaction price. Calibration ensures that the valuation technique reflects current\nmarket conditions, and it helps an entity to determine whether an adjustment to the valuation\ntechnique is necessary (eg there might be a characteristic of the asset \u2026 that is not captured by  \n-----  the valuation technique). After initial recognition, when measuring fair value using a valuation\ntechnique or techniques that use unobservable inputs, an entity shall ensure that those valuation\ntechniques reflect observable market data (eg the price for a similar asset \u2026) at the measurement\ndate.  \nBC189 The Board considered the suggestion in paragraph BC188 and decided not to require estimates of a nonfinancial asset\u2019s current replacement cost to be restricted to actual transactions, as an application of\nparagraph 64 of AASB 13. This is because:  \n(a) the Board considers that many inputs to estimates of the current cost of restoring another entity\u2019s\nasset (eg current unit costs, including costs of labour and materials) are likely to be observable,\nwhereas paragraph 64 of AASB 13 applies to valuation techniques that use unobservable inputs;\nand  \n(b) using costs of restoration work yet to be incurred involves neither of the circumstances\nspecifically mentioned in paragraph 64 of AASB 13, namely:  \n(i) calibration being necessary to ensure the fair value estimate reflects current market\nconditions; and  \n(ii) the valuation technique does not capture a characteristic of the asset.  \nBC190 In relation to paragraph BC189(b), the Board noted that paragraphs BC143\u2013BC146 of the IASB\u2019s Basis for\nConclusions on IFRS 13 indicate that the valuation adjustments involving calibration relate to measurement\nuncertainty, mainly in respect of financial assets and liabilities. The two circumstances identified in IASB\nparagraph BC145 that are not confined to financial assets and liabilities are where:  \n(a) calibration is necessary to capture a characteristic of the asset or liability; and  \n(b) measurement uncertainty has arisen from a significant decrease in the volume or level of market\nactivity for the asset or liability.  \nBC191 The Board considers that neither of the circumstances referred to in paragraph BC190 seems particularly\napplicable to the treatment of restoration costs yet to be incurred by the entity at the measurement date.",

The Board\nconcluded that using data of replacing an asset on a piecemeal basis might not be fully consistent with the\nobjective of a fair value measurement under the cost approach. This is because a market participant buyer\nneeding to acquire or construct an asset in its entirety would not need to incur additional costs that arise\nfrom replacing an existing asset on a piecemeal basis (such as security costs incurred to provide continuity\nof service delivery), nor would it logically be willing to pay the holder of the subject asset for incurring\nthose additional costs.  \nBC193 The guidance in paragraph F14 that an entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information\nabout the costs referred to in paragraphs F12 and F13, provided that the entity includes all such costs for\nwhich data are reasonably available, should address concerns about practical difficulties of measuring the\ncurrent cost to hypothetically replace an asset in its entirety if the asset\u2019s parts are actually replaced on a\npiecemeal basis. Where specific additional costs arising from piecemeal replacement are identifiable, they\ncan readily be excluded from the estimate of the asset\u2019s current replacement cost. Where it is unclear\nwhether some \u2018piecemeal costs\u2019 would differ if incurred as part of an entire replacement, when paragraph\nF5 applies, applying its principle to use the entity\u2019s own assumptions as a starting point and adjust them\nonly to the extent that reasonably available information indicates that other market participants would use\ndifferent data, would generally mean that the entity\u2019s own costs would be used, thus overcoming the\npractical difficulty of estimating the cost to hypothetically replace an asset in its entirety.",

In particular, if a private sector entity constructs an asset on behalf of the not-for-profit public\nsector entity, and if finance costs were to be included in the asset\u2019s current replacement cost, some\nstakeholders asked for guidance on whether the private sector entity\u2019s, or public sector entity\u2019s, assetspecific borrowing rate should be used in estimating the finance costs.  \nBC197 The Board observed that the treatment of borrowing costs and other finance costs when measuring the\ncurrent replacement cost of an asset is not specific to not-for-profit entities in the public or private sector. It\nconcluded that, in light of AASB 13 not specifying the treatment of those costs for fair value measurements\nby for-profit entities, it would be inappropriate to mandate a particular treatment for not-for-profit entities\napplying AASB 13.  \nBC198 The International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC) has indicated that consideration should be given\nto including borrowing costs and equity costs in the fair value of property, plant and equipment. IVS 105\nstates:  \nThe cost elements may differ depending on the type of the asset and should include the direct and\nindirect costs that would be required to replace/recreate the asset as of the valuation date. Some\ncommon items to consider include: (a) direct costs \u2026 (b) indirect costs: \u2026 7. finance costs (eg,\n**interest on debt financing), and 8. profit margin/entrepreneurial profit to the creator of the asset**\n(eg, return to investors). (paragraph 70.11, emphasis added)  \nBC199 The Board noted that some stakeholders argue that a not-for-profit public sector entity should exclude\nborrowing costs from the current replacement cost of an asset if that entity elects, under paragraph Aus8.1\nof AASB 123 Borrowing Costs, not to capitalise borrowing costs into the cost of qualifying assets. Some of\nthose stakeholders argued that including borrowing costs in an asset\u2019s current replacement cost after writing\nthem off on initial recognition of a qualifying asset would give rise to a revaluation gain that reflects\ninconsistent treatment of borrowing costs at different measurement dates \u2013 which they argue would not\nfaithfully represent a change in the asset\u2019s value. The Board notes that this is a similar concern to that noted\nin paragraph BC181(b) regarding restoration costs included in the current replacement cost of an asset\nwithout having been incurred during the asset\u2019s initial construction, giving rise to what some stakeholders\nregard as an anomalous gain.  \nBC200 The Board considered that the accounting policy choice regarding capitalisation of borrowing costs at the\nasset\u2019s initial recognition under AASB 123 is irrelevant to how those costs should be treated in subsequent\nmeasurements of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.\nThis is because the price that market participant buyers would pay for an asset is unaffected by accounting\npolicies adopted in respect of that asset. The recognition of initial costs and subsequent measurement are\nfundamentally different processes. Therefore, there should be no presumption that the treatment of\nborrowing costs should be consistent for both. The Board observed that paragraph B4 of AASB 13\nidentifies a range of circumstances in which an asset\u2019s fair value at initial recognition can differ from its\ntransaction price, indicating that items of comprehensive income can arise from differences between the\ntransaction price reflected in initial measurement and fair value.  \n-----  ",

Where the cost approach is used, if borrowing costs or other finance\ncosts are included in the asset\u2019s fair value measurement, under the guidance in paragraphs F5 and F6:  \n(a) if all relevant information about market participant assumptions needed to estimate the fair value\nof the asset is reasonably available, including information about finance costs assumptions, the\nentity would use those assumptions in measuring the fair value of the asset; or  \n(b) if some relevant information about market participant assumptions needed to estimate the fair\nvalue of the asset is not reasonably available, the entity\u2019s own assumptions would be used as a\nstarting point to determine the amount of finance costs to include in the asset\u2019s current\nreplacement cost.

        "page_content=": "## Economic obsolescence (paragraphs F16\u2013F19)  \nBC209 Paragraph B9 of AASB 13 states that obsolescence incorporated in an asset\u2019s current replacement cost\nincludes \u2018external (economic) obsolescence\u2019. Paragraph IE12(b) of IFRS 13 gives an example of economic\nobsolescence of a machine held for use, namely, \u201cconditions external to the condition of the machine such\nas a decline in the market demand for similar machines\u201d.  \nBC210 An equivalent notion of economic obsolescence of an asset or a facility held by a not-for-profit public\nsector entity is obsolescence arising from a decline in demand for the services provided by the asset or\nfacility, such as a school. The Board was asked to provide guidance on the circumstances in which a notfor-profit public sector entity should identify economic obsolescence of assets measured at fair value using\nthe cost approach, in light of uncertainty and diverse interpretations. In particular, the Board was asked to\nclarify whether an entity should identify economic obsolescence of a facility that has suffered a reduction in\ndemand for its services before a formal decision has been made to reduce the facility\u2019s physical capacity,\nincluding a plan for when that decision will be implemented.  \nBC211 Some stakeholders argued that an entity should not identify economic obsolescence of a facility before a\nformal decision has been made to reduce the facility\u2019s physical capacity because, until then, it is highly\nunlikely to be clear whether \u2013 and to what extent \u2013 economic obsolescence exists. The Board noted that the\nprimary consideration in assessing when to identify economic obsolescence is whether market participants\nwould deduct an amount for economic obsolescence from the asset\u2019s replacement cost when pricing the\nasset. This would depend on the entity\u2019s circumstances, and not on whether a formal decision has been\nmade to reduce the asset\u2019s physical capacity.  \nBC212 In some instances, it might be clear that market participants would deduct an amount for economic\nobsolescence when pricing an asset, even if a formal decision has not been made. Deferring inclusion of\neconomic obsolescence in the measurement of the asset\u2019s current replacement cost until a formal decision is\nmade would not result in a faithful representation of the adjustment for obsolescence required by paragraph\nB9 of AASB 13. In addition, such deferral would not result in the best estimate of the price that market\nparticipant buyers would pay for the asset, and therefore would be inconsistent with the requirement in\nparagraph 22 of AASB 13 to measure an asset\u2019s fair value using the assumptions that market participants\nwould use when pricing the asset.  \nBC213 The Board observed that its conclusion on this issue is consistent with the guidance on the measurement of\nreplacement cost in the IPSASB\u2019s Conceptual Framework (paragraph 7.41 of which states that an asset\u2019s\nreplacement cost reflects reductions in required service capacity, without mentioning a need to formally\ndecide to reduce the asset\u2019s capacity).  \nBC214 The Board noted that part of the debate about the circumstances in which to identify economic obsolescence\nstemmed from perceptions that AASB 13 does not have regard to the temporary or cyclical nature of\nshortfalls in demand for services rendered by an asset when determining whether economic obsolescence\nexists. Therefore, the Board decided to clarify that surplus capacity of an asset that is necessary for stand-by\nor safety purposes should not be identified as economic obsolescence.  \nBC215 Increases in demand that eliminate an apparent, but illusory, overcapacity need not be long-term in nature.\nFor example, a school in a mining town might presently appear to have overcapacity but require a higher\nservice capacity than indicated by present enrolments, because its enrolments are cyclical due to peaks and\ntroughs in mining activity. Such apparent overcapacity is similar to standby assets held by entities to cope\nwith peaks in demand: such standby assets are not affected by economic obsolescence simply because they\nare presently inactive. The Board observed that this is consistent with the guidance in:  \n(a) the IPSASB Conceptual Framework, paragraph 7.41 of which states that the appropriate service\npotential included in measuring an asset\u2019s replacement cost \u201cis that which the entity is capable of\nusing or expects to use, having regard to the need to hold sufficient service capacity to deal with\ncontingencies\u201d; and  \n-----  (b) the New Zealand Accounting Standard for Public Benefit Entities entitled PBE IPSAS 17.\nParagraph AG21 of the Application Guidance included in PBE IPSAS 17[2] states that: \u201cNo\nobsolescence adjustment is made in respect of surplus capacity that, while rarely or never used, is\nnecessary for stand-by or safety purposes.\u201d  \nBC216 The Board was asked to provide guidance on whether, for assets measured at current replacement cost and\naffected by economic obsolescence (eg excess capacity), an entity is required to perform two valuations\n(one based on the existing capacity, and another based on the estimated required capacity) in order to\nestimate the gross replacement cost and related accumulated obsolescence of the asset. The Board\nconcluded that only one valuation, based on the required capacity (eg based on a school for 100 students in\nthe example in paragraph F18 in the implementation guidance) would be required at the measurement date.\nHowever, the Board also noted that a linear relationship should not be assumed between the extent of\neconomic obsolescence and a reduction in demand for a facility\u2019s services. Some assets composing a\nfacility (such as a school) might need to be replaced in full to replace the facility\u2019s service capacity.\nTherefore, simply adjusting the asset\u2019s value for obsolescence by the percentage reduction in demand for\nthe facility\u2019s services would result in a value that is less than the asset\u2019s fair value. In the example presented\nof a school, the current replacement cost of the school would not reduce by a linear amount per student\nattending, due to the need to maintain certain components of the school, even as student numbers decline.  \nBC217 In response to requests for clarification of the proposed guidance in ED 320 or additional examples, the\nBoard included:  \n(a) in the implementation guidance, an example of an asset with \u2018surplus capacity\u2019 necessary to cater\nfor periods of peak demand, and clarification (in the context of the example of a school with a\nstrong indicator of economic obsolescence) that a linear relationship should not be assumed\nbetween the extent of any economic obsolescence and a reduction in demand for a facility\u2019s\nservices; and  \n(b) an illustrative example (Example 5) illustrating that operating an asset for shorter periods than\nphysically is possible, due to the operating environment of the not-for-profit public sector entity,\ndoes not of itself indicate economic obsolescence has arisen.",

IVS 105 paragraph 80.5 states:  \nPhysical obsolescence can be measured in two different ways:  \n(a) curable physical obsolescence, ie, the cost to fix/cure the obsolescence, or  \n(b) incurable physical obsolescence which considers the asset\u2019s age, expected total and\nremaining life where the adjustment for physical obsolescence is equivalent to the\nproportion of the expected total life consumed. Total expected life may be expressed in\nany reasonable way, including expected life in years, mileage, units produced, etc.  \nBC219 In relation to consideration of the replacement cost of a modern equivalent reference asset to estimate the\nfair value of the subject asset under the cost approach, a stakeholder commented that AASB 13 deals\ninadequately with the modern equivalent asset having more features and therefore a higher replacement cost\nthan the subject asset, and requested the Board provides guidance on how to measure the adjustment for the\ndifference in cost between the service levels provided by such a reference asset and the subject asset (which\ngenerally is a less-modern asset).  \nBC220 In respect of the requests noted in paragraphs BC218 and BC219, the Board observed that:  \n(a) paragraphs B8\u2013B9 of AASB 13 do not distinguish curable and incurable physical obsolescence;\nand  \n(b) the IASB did not include guidance on how to measure obsolescence when the cost approach is\napplied.

The Board considered this comment and formed the view that Australian Accounting Standards\nshould not limit the application of the market approach, income approach or cost approach beyond any\nlimits in the requirements of paragraph 61 of AASB 13.  \nBC231 Issuing the guidance requested by some stakeholders (ie specifying the approach to apply to different types\nof asset) would appear to conflict with the requirements of paragraph 61 of AASB 13 because it might\nconstrain entities from using the best evidence of fair value in the circumstances. In addition, paragraphs 62\nand 63 of AASB 13 indicate that using a combination of the market, income and cost approaches might be\nappropriate for various assets. Issuing guidance favouring particular approaches for particular types of\nassets might be incompatible with that \u2018combination of approaches\u2019 guidance in AASB 13.  \nBC232 Accordingly, the modifications to AASB 13 set out in this Standard (eg the modification of the guidance on\n\u2018financially feasible use\u2019 in paragraph Aus28.1) do not indicate that the income approach cannot be applied\nwhen measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset of a not-for-profit public sector entity not held\nprimarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows. The entity needs to use judgement in determining\nwhich valuation technique (or combination of techniques) to apply, considering all facts and circumstances\nand the availability of observable inputs relevant to the subject asset.  \nBC233 In relation to the request for guidance on the quantum of discounts deducted for the effects of restrictions\nwhen measuring the fair value of restricted assets using the market approach (see paragraph BC226(b)), the\nBoard noted that, for land held by not-for-profit public sector entities, the market approach is primarily\napplied. The Board rejected the notion of developing guidance on the quantum of discounts in relation to\nland for the reasons set out in paragraphs BC253 and BC254.  \nBC234 Further, the Board observed that most public sector entities do not determine their own accounting policies\nfor applying the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, particularly in relation to policies for\ntransactions that are common across the public sector \u2013 those policies are determined by the Treasury or\nFinance Department (or other authority) or the Office of Local Government in each jurisdiction. In relation\nto the Board\u2019s conclusion not to develop guidance beyond the scope of that in this Standard, if the Treasury\nor Finance Department (or other authority) and/or the Office of Local Government in a jurisdiction desires\ngreater consistency in the valuation approach(es) used to measure the fair value of particular types or\nclasses of non-financial assets in a jurisdiction, it may choose to designate a valuation approach for\napplication to those assets held by public sector entities in its jurisdiction. In effect, where AASB 13\nrequires the exercise of judgement regarding the appropriate valuation approach, the Treasury or Finance\nDepartment (or other authority) and/or the Office of Local Government may apply judgement on behalf of\nentities in its jurisdiction.",

Stakeholders\nhave informed the Board that many not-for-profit public sector entities are subject to public-sector-specific\nlegal restrictions beyond the zoning and easement restrictions (such as legislation specific to public sector\nentities or directions from Ministers) prohibiting the entity from using the land and improvements on land\nfor a purpose other than its current use. For example, a not-for-profit public sector entity might be subject to  \n-----  a legal restriction prohibiting it from using a hospital and the hospital land for a purpose other than as a\nhospital.  \nBC236 This section of the Basis for Conclusions (paragraphs BC237\u2013BC259) discusses public-sector-specific legal\nrestrictions that are expected to be transferred to other not-for-profit public sector market participants in a\nhypothetical sale transaction. Legal restrictions that would not transfer to other market participants in a\nhypothetical sale transaction are not considered in fair value measurement of an asset.  \nBC237 The Board noted that in many cases, the current zoning of the land would reflect the land\u2019s public-sectorspecific legal restrictions, such as having a community zoning that restricts a parcel of land to be used for\ncommunity purposes. However, there might be situations in which land is zoned for a commercial purpose,\nbut the not-for-profit public sector entity holding the land is subject to legislation preventing that entity\nfrom using any of its non-financial assets for a commercial purpose.  \nBC238 Panel members and other stakeholders who responded to ITC 34 originally asked the Board to provide\nguidance on:  \n(a) how public-sector-specific legal restrictions that would be expected to transfer to other publicsector market participants should be treated when measuring the fair value of land and\nimprovements on land that are not held primarily for their ability to generate net cash inflows;\nand  \n(b) which measurement techniques should be used in measuring the fair value of such land.  \nBC239 Stakeholders informed the Board that the fair value of some land subject to public-sector-specific legal\nrestrictions and not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows has been valued at a very low\namount; sometimes a nominal amount (eg $1 for some restricted land). They questioned whether measuring\nsuch restricted land at such a low value appropriately reflects the service potential of the restricted land.\nThis question was asked in the context of paragraph Aus49.1 of the _Framework for the Preparation and_\n_Presentation of Financial Statements (applicable to not-for-profit entities), which states that \u2018future_\neconomic benefits\u2019 or \u2018service potential\u2019 can be described as \u2018the scarce capacity to provide benefits to the\nentities that use them\u2019.  \nBC240 The Board did not form a view on whether measuring such restricted land at a low amount or nominal\namount would reflect the capacity of the restricted land available to provide benefits to the holder of the\nland (or to provide services to the community). The Board is undertaking a project to adapt its Conceptual\n_Framework for Financial Reporting (2021) for application by not-for-profit entities, including those in the_\npublic sector. The Board plans to consider the description of service potential in the context of an asset of a\nnot-for-profit entity as part of that project. At this stage it is unclear whether that Board consideration would\nhave implications for the measurement of restricted land.",

In this regard:  \n(a) most stakeholders commented that the market approach is used to measure the fair value of land,\nincluding land subject to public-sector-specific legal restrictions; whereas improvements on such\nrestricted land are generally considered specialised assets, for which the cost approach is\ngenerally applied in measuring their fair value; but  \n(b) a minority of stakeholders commented that, when a parcel of land of a not-for-profit public sector\nentity not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows is subject to public-sectorspecific legal restrictions, but an equivalent parcel of land with the same public-sector-specific\nlegal restrictions is not obtainable in the marketplace at the measurement date for a price\nsupported by observable market evidence, the fair value of such land should be measured using\nthe cost approach.  \nBC242 The views of these stakeholder groups are elaborated on in paragraphs BC243\u2013BC253.  \n_The minority view regarding land subject to public-sector-specific legal restrictions_  \nBC243 The minority of stakeholders mentioned in paragraph BC241(b) considered that the cost approach would be\nthe most appropriate measurement technique for measuring the fair value of restricted land where an\nequivalent parcel of land subject to the same public-sector-specific legal restrictions is not obtainable in the\nmarketplace at the measurement date for a price supported by observable market evidence. They also\ncommented that if the cost approach is applied, those public-sector-specific legal restrictions would not  \n-----  reduce the fair value of such restricted land to an amount less than the price of equivalent land without those\nrestrictions. This is because, if an equivalent restricted parcel of land is not obtainable in the marketplace,\nthe entity would need to purchase an equivalent parcel of land without those restrictions to continue\ndelivering services, and the existence of such a restriction does not affect the price of this purchase.  \nBC244 Those stakeholders reached this view because they interpreted that, when applying the IASB\u2019s views in\nIFRS 13 paragraphs BC78\u2013BC79:  \n(a) many parcels of land might have little value if sold on a stand-alone basis (due to the restrictions),\nbut would have a significant value to the holder of the asset (in terms of the asset\u2019s ability to\nprovide goods or services to beneficiaries) when used together with other non-financial assets;\nand  \n(b) the market approach might be inappropriate in measuring the land\u2019s fair value when the market\nprice of the land represents the use of the land on a stand-alone basis rather than in combination\nwith complementary assets.  \nBC245 Further, those stakeholders considered that, because the land subject to public-sector-specific legal\nrestrictions is not held primarily for its ability to generate net cash inflows, it would generally be\ninappropriate to apply the income approach as an alternative to the market approach and, consequently, the\ncost approach should be used to measure the fair value of such restricted land.  \n_The majority view regarding land subject to public-sector-specific legal restrictions_  \nBC246 The majority of stakeholders mentioned in paragraph BC241(a) expressed the view that land, including land\nsubject to public-sector-specific legal restrictions, should generally be measured using the market approach.\nThey disagree with the view expressed by the minority of stakeholders noted in BC243 \u2013 that the cost\napproach should be applied in measuring such restricted land, and the fair value of such restricted land\nwould not be lower than the price of equivalent land without such restrictions because of the effect of\npublic-sector-specific legal restrictions, if an equivalent restricted parcel of land is not obtainable in the\nmarketplace at the measurement date for a price supported by observable market evidence. Under the\nmarket approach, the fair value of a parcel of land should reflect any restrictions on that land, including any\npublic-sector-specific legal restrictions, that would transfer to market participants in a hypothetical sale\ntransaction.  \nBC247 This majority of stakeholders commented that although an \u2018equivalent\u2019 parcel of land with the same publicsector-specific legal restrictions might not be obtainable in the marketplace at the measurement date for a\nprice supported by observable market evidence (because public-sector-specific legal restrictions often\nprevent an entity from selling the land), there are market transactions for other parcels of land that are\nsuitable reference assets. Therefore, those stakeholders consider there are more relevant observable inputs\nfor applying the market approach, rather than the cost approach, in measuring the fair value of land subject\nto such restrictions.  \nBC248 Some of the stakeholders referred to in paragraph BC247 also commented that any improvements (eg a\nhospital building) on a parcel of land reduce the land\u2019s service potential. They consider that improvements\non land would reduce the options the not-for-profit public sector entity holder of the land has to use the land\nfor another purpose, unless the improvements are demolished.",

Unless there is significant inconsistency in applying\naccounting principles in practice, there is no clear case for mandating the use of a particular valuation\ntechnique in measuring the fair value of a particular type or class of assets.  \nBC251 Despite the debate regarding fair value measurement of land subject to public-sector-specific legal\nrestrictions, feedback from most stakeholders in targeted outreach and most feedback on ITC 45 indicated  \n-----  that, in practice, the fair value of each type or class of assets affected by this issue is being measured using a\nlargely consistent approach \u2013 that is:  \n(a) for land subject to public-sector-specific legal restrictions, the market approach is used (although,\nas noted in paragraph BC253 below, at a more detailed level, different methods are being used to\ncalculate the adjustments to reflect restrictions); and  \n(b) for improvements on such restricted land, the cost approach is generally used, and an adjustment\nis not deducted to reflect the effect of public-sector-specific legal restrictions because the\nexistence of a public-sector-specific legal restriction does not affect the price that the entity would\nneed to incur to replace the asset at the measurement date.  \nBC252 In addition, the Board noted that paragraph 11 of AASB 13 states that a fair value measurement is for a\nparticular asset; and, therefore, when measuring the fair value of an asset, the entity considers the\ncharacteristics of the asset if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing\nthe asset at the measurement date, including the condition and location of the asset, as well as any\nrestrictions on the sale or use of the asset. This would include consideration of any public-sector-specific\nlegal restriction that would be transferred to a market participant.  \nBC253 Some stakeholders commented that there is inconsistency in practice regarding the amounts (eg\npercentages) of adjustments being deducted from the value of land to reflect public-sector-specific legal\nrestrictions, and asked the Board to provide guidance to reduce that inconsistency. Further, some\nstakeholders informed the Board that different valuers use different methods in calculating the adjustments,\nfor example:  \n(a) using the price of nearby land not subject to the same public-sector-specific legal restriction and\nexplicitly deducting an adjustment for the effect of the restriction (explicit adjustment); or  \n(b) using the price of land with a much lower intensity of use \u2013 and, consequently, a much lower\nvalue \u2013 than that of nearby land without a public-sector-specific legal restriction and not\nexplicitly deducting an adjustment for the effect of the restriction because it is implicitly taken\ninto account by using cheaper land in a lower-intensity-of-use location as a reference asset\n(implicit adjustment).  \nBC254 Since the condition and location of every parcel of land are likely to differ, and the effect of public-sectorspecific legal restrictions on fair value measurements of land might vary depending on the likelihood of the\nrestrictions being lifted and whether the land is urban, suburban or rural, the Board considered that it would\nneither be practical nor appropriate for Australian Accounting Standards to specify the amount of\nappropriate adjustments (eg in percentage terms) under the market approach to reflect the effect of\nrestrictions that would transfer to market participants.  \nBC255 As noted in paragraph BC234, in deciding not to develop guidance specific to fair value measurement of\nland subject to public-sector-specific legal restrictions, the Board observed that if the Treasury or Finance\nDepartment (or other authority) and/or the Office of Local Government in a jurisdiction desires greater\nconsistency in the valuation approach(es) used to measure the fair value of particular types or classes of\nnon-financial assets in a jurisdiction, it may choose to designate a valuation approach for application to\nthose assets held by public sector entities in its jurisdiction.",

However, a few respondents requested the Board to mandate the\nuse of the cost approach in measuring the fair value, or the use of an entity-specific entry price to measure\nthe current value, of all non-financial assets of not-for-profit public sector entities not primarily held for\ntheir ability to generate net cash inflows. The Board observed that the feedback received on ED 320 did not\nidentify any supporting or opposing arguments that had not yet been considered by the Board in deciding\nthat fair value should remain the sole current value measurement for non-financial assets and not to mandate\nthe measurement technique to apply for measuring the fair value of specific assets, including restricted land.  \nBC257 In addition, a few other respondents asked the Board to elevate paragraph IE29 of the IASB\u2019s Illustrative\nExamples accompanying IFRS 13 (quoted in paragraph BC103) to authoritative guidance. That IASB\nillustrative example included a comment indicating that restrictions would be taken into account only if they\ntransfer to the market participant buyer, and those respondents envisage that elevating the specific comment\nto authoritative guidance would effectively preclude the deduction of discounts for restricted land.  \nBC258 The Board observed that the IASB decided to include that example in supplementary supporting material\nrather than as part of IFRS 13. The IASB stated that its Illustrative Examples illustrate aspects of IFRS 13\nbut are not intended to provide interpretative guidance. Accordingly, adding such an example in the Board\u2019s  \n-----  implementation guidance (which will be an integral part of AASB 13) would, inappropriately, elevate the\nstatus of the IASB example above that accorded to it by the IASB. In addition, it would create a risk that\nreaders interpret the example as a rule of thumb. This is because:  \n(a) the IASB\u2019s conclusion in the above-mentioned paragraph IE29 of its Illustrative Examples that\n\u201cthe donor restriction on the use of the land\u201d would not be taken into account in the fair value\nmeasurement of the land is drawn only after \u201cUpon review of relevant documentation (eg legal\nand other), the association determines that the fiduciary responsibility to meet the donor\u2019s\nrestriction would not be transferred to market participants if the association sold the asset\u201d; and  \n(b) that example did not include consideration of the zoning of the land and the likelihood that the\nzoning would change as stated in paragraph 140.5 of International Valuation Standard IVS 104\n_Bases of Value._  \nBC259 The Board considered that financial statement preparers, auditors and valuers need to apply judgement,\nbased on the circumstances of each asset, in determining whether a restriction imposed on an asset would\ntransfer to market participants. Therefore, the Board decided not to add that IASB example to AASB 13.",

Mixed feedback was received on\nthat ED question.  \nBC270 The Board decided to limit the scope of this Amending Standard to not-for-profit public sector entities\nbecause the Board did not receive any requests for guidance from stakeholders in the not-for-profit private\nsector during the project. To the date of issuing this Standard, the Board has not been informed that:  \n(a) a significant number of not-for-profit private sector entities measure their non-financial assets at\nfair value;  \n(b) not-for-profit private sector entities are encountering significant issues with applying AASB 13 in\nmeasuring non-financial assets; or  \n(c) some principles of AASB 13 have been applied inconsistently in this sector in measuring nonfinancial assets (unlike in the public sector).  \nBC271 The Board noted that limiting the scope of modifications to not-for-profit public sector entities may not\nnecessarily breach its transaction neutrality policy because many assets held by not-for-profit public sector\nentities are largely unique to the public sector. That is, for many assets, it is unlikely that private sector\nentities would hold similar assets to those held in the public sector.  \nBC272 Even if it were considered that limiting the modifications to not-for-profit public sector entities would be\ninconsistent with the transaction neutrality policy, the Board considered that this would be justified. This is\nbecause, unlike public sector entities, private sector entities have a choice to subsequently measure their\nnon-financial assets using the cost model rather than the revaluation model (in AASB 116 or AASB 138\n_Intangible Assets). This results in non-financial asset values measured using different models among private_\nsector entities\u2019 financial statements, thus being less comparable than the asset values reported by public\nsector entities. Accordingly, applying this Amending Standard, which is limited to measuring non-financial\nassets using the revaluation model, would not fully achieve comparability among not-for-profit private\nsector entities in measuring their non-financial assets.  \n-----  BC273 In accordance with the _AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework, for the reasons noted in_\nparagraphs BC270\u2013BC272, the Board determined that a case has not been made for it to undertake\nstandard-setting work to investigate whether there is a need to modify AASB 13 for application by not-forprofit private sector entities.  \n-----  ",
