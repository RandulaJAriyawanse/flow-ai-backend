        "text": "# Accounting Standard AASB 4\n\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board made Accounting Standard AASB 4 Insurance Contracts under section 334 of the Corporations Act 2001 on 7 August 2015. This compiled version of AASB 4 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. It incorporates relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 17 September 2020 (see Compilation Details).\n\n# Accounting Standard AASB 4 Insurance Contracts\n\n# Objective\n\nThe objective of this Standard, in conjunction with AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts, is to specify the financial reporting for insurance contracts by any entity that issues such contracts (described in this Standard as an insurer) until the AASB and the IASB complete the second phase of the project on insurance contracts. In particular, this Standard requires:\n\n- (a) limited improvements to accounting by insurers for insurance contracts.\n- (b) disclosure that identifies and explains the amounts in an insurer\u2019s financial statements arising from insurance contracts and helps users of those financial statements understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts.\n\n# Scope\n\nAn entity shall apply this Standard to:\n\n- (a) insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts) that it issues and reinsurance contracts that it holds.\n- (b) financial instruments that it issues with a discretionary participation feature (see paragraph 35). AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires disclosure about financial instruments, including financial instruments that contain such features.\n\nThis Standard does not address other aspects of accounting by insurers, such as accounting for financial assets held by insurers and financial liabilities issued by insurers (see AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation, AASB 7 and AASB 9 Financial Instruments), except:\n\n- (a) paragraph 20A permits insurers that meet specified criteria to apply a temporary exemption from AASB 9;\n- (b) paragraph 35B permits insurers to apply the overlay approach to designated financial assets; and\n- (c) paragraph 45 permits insurers to reclassify in specified circumstances some or all of their financial assets so that the assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n# Aus3.1\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph 2, to comply with the requirements of this Standard, an entity shall apply:\n\n- (a) AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts to general insurance contracts, except for fixed-fee service contracts that meet the definition of an insurance contract under this Standard; and\n- (b) AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts to life insurance contracts.\n\nWhere this Standard provides an accounting policy choice, an entity shall apply that choice in the context of the requirements specified in AASB 1023 and AASB 1038, when applicable.\n\n# Aus3.2\n\nThis Standard includes only limited guidance in accounting for insurance contracts and disclosure requirements. AASB 1023 and AASB 1038 address all aspects of recognition, measurement and disclosure of general insurance contracts and life insurance contracts. The requirements of those Standards address a wider range of accounting requirements than this Standard, but enable simultaneous compliance with this Standard.\n\nAASB 4-compiled 6 STANDARD Authorised Version F2021C00205 registered 10/03/2021",

However, a cedant shall apply this Standard to reinsurance contracts that it holds.|\n\n# For ease of reference, this Standard describes any entity that issues an insurance contract as an insurer, whether or not the issuer is regarded as an insurer for legal or supervisory purposes. All references in paragraphs 3(a)\u20133(b), 20A\u201320Q, 35B\u201335N, 39B\u201339M and 46\u201349 to an insurer shall be read as also referring to an issuer of a financial instrument that contains a discretionary participation feature.\n\n# A reinsurance contract is a type of insurance contract. Accordingly, all references in this Standard to insurance contracts also apply to reinsurance contracts.\n\n# This Standard applies to fixed-fee service contracts, described in paragraphs B6 and B7, which meet the definition of an insurance contract under this Standard.\n\n# Embedded derivatives\n\nAASB 9 requires an entity to separate some embedded derivatives from their host contract, measure them at fair value and include changes in their fair value in profit or loss. AASB 9 applies to derivatives embedded in an insurance contract unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract.\n\n# Unbundling of deposit components\n\nSome insurance contracts contain both an insurance component and a deposit component. In some cases, an insurer is required or permitted to unbundle those components:\n\n(a)\nunbundling is required if both the following conditions are met: - (i) the insurer can measure the deposit component (including any embedded surrender options) separately (ie without considering the insurance component).\n- (ii) the insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not otherwise require it to recognise all obligations and rights arising from the deposit component.",

A cedant receives compensation for losses from a reinsurer, but the contract obliges the cedant to repay the compensation in future years. That obligation arises from a deposit component. If the cedant\u2019s accounting policies would otherwise permit it to recognise the compensation as income without recognising the resulting obligation, unbundling is required.\n\nTo unbundle a contract, an insurer shall:\n\n- (a) apply this Standard to the insurance component.\n- (b) apply AASB 9 to the deposit component.\n\n# Recognition and measurement\n\nTemporary exemption from some other Australian Accounting Standards\n\nParagraphs 10\u201312 of AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors specify criteria for an entity to use in developing an accounting policy if no Standard applies specifically to an item. However, this Standard exempts an insurer from applying those criteria to its accounting policies for:\n\n- (a) insurance contracts that it issues (including related acquisition costs and related intangible assets, such as those described in paragraphs 31 and 32); and\n- (b) reinsurance contracts that it holds.\n\nNevertheless, this Standard does not exempt an insurer from some implications of the criteria in paragraphs 10\u201312 of AASB 108. Specifically, an insurer:\n\n- (a) shall not recognise as a liability any provisions for possible future claims, if those claims arise under insurance contracts that are not in existence at the end of the reporting period (such as catastrophe provisions and equalisation provisions).\n- (b) shall carry out the liability adequacy test described in paragraphs 15\u201319.\n- (c) shall remove an insurance liability (or a part of an insurance liability) from its statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished\u2014ie when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n- (d) shall not offset:\n- - (i) reinsurance assets against the related insurance liabilities; or\n- (ii) income or expense from reinsurance contracts against the expense or income from the related insurance contracts.\n\n(e) shall consider whether its reinsurance assets are impaired (see paragraph 20).\n\n# Liability adequacy test\n\nAn insurer shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether its recognised insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of future cash flows under its insurance contracts. If that assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities (less related deferred acquisition costs and related intangible assets, such as those discussed in paragraphs 31 and 32) is inadequate in the light of the estimated future cash flows, the entire deficiency shall be recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf an insurer applies a liability adequacy test that meets specified minimum requirements, this Standard imposes no further requirements. The minimum requirements are the following:\n\n- (a) The test considers current estimates of all contractual cash flows, and of related cash flows such as claims handling costs, as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees.",

A reinsurance asset is impaired if, and only if:\n\n- (a) there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the cedant may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract; and\n- (b) that event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the cedant will receive from the reinsurer.\n\n# Temporary exemption from AASB 9\n\nAASB 9 addresses the accounting for financial instruments and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. However, for an insurer that meets the criteria in paragraph 20B, this Standard provides a temporary exemption that permits, but does not require, the insurer to apply AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement rather than AASB 9 for annual periods beginning before 1 January 2023. An insurer that applies the temporary exemption from AASB 9 shall:\n\n- (a) use the requirements in AASB 9 that are necessary to provide the disclosures required in paragraphs 39B\u201339J of this Standard; and\n- (b) apply all other applicable Standards to its financial instruments, except as described in paragraphs 20A\u201320Q, 39B\u201339J and 46\u201347 of this Standard.\n\n# An insurer may apply the temporary exemption from AASB 9 if, and only if:\n\n- (a) it has not previously applied any version of AASB 92, other than only the requirements for the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss in paragraphs 5.7.1(c), 5.7.7\u20135.7.9, 7.2.14 and B5.7.5\u2013B5.7.20 of AASB 9; and\n- (b) its activities are predominantly connected with insurance, as described in paragraph 20D, at its annual reporting date that immediately precedes 1 April 2016, or at a subsequent annual reporting date as specified in paragraph 20G.\n\nThe relevant insurance liabilities are those insurance liabilities (and related deferred acquisition costs and related intangible assets) for which the insurer\u2019s accounting policies do not require a liability adequacy test that meets the minimum requirements of paragraph 16.\n\nThe Board issued successive principal versions of AASB 9 in 2009, 2010 and 2014.",

If an insurer elects to apply those requirements, it shall apply the relevant transition provisions in AASB 9, disclose the fact that it has applied those requirements and provide on an ongoing basis the related disclosures set out in paragraphs 10\u201311 of AASB 7 (as amended by AASB 9 (2010)).\n\n# 20D\n\nAn insurer\u2019s activities are predominantly connected with insurance if, and only if:\n\n- (a) the carrying amount of its liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of this Standard, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038, which includes any deposit components or embedded derivatives unbundled from insurance contracts applying paragraphs 7\u201312 of this Standard, is significant compared to the total carrying amount of all its liabilities; and\n- (b) the percentage of the total carrying amount of its liabilities connected with insurance (see paragraph 20E) relative to the total carrying amount of all its liabilities is:\n- (i) greater than 90 per cent; or\n- (ii) less than or equal to 90 per cent but greater than 80 per cent, and the insurer does not engage in a significant activity unconnected with insurance (see paragraph 20F).\n\n# 20E\n\nFor the purposes of applying paragraph 20D(b), liabilities connected with insurance comprise:\n\n- (a) liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of this Standard, AASB 1023 and AASB 1038, as described in paragraph 20D(a);\n- (b) non-derivative investment contract liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss applying AASB 139 (including those designated as at fair value through profit or loss to which the insurer has applied the requirements in AASB 9 for the presentation of gains and losses (see paragraphs 20B(a) and 20C)); and\n- (c) liabilities that arise because the insurer issues, or fulfils obligations arising from, the contracts in (a) and (b). Examples of such liabilities include derivatives used to mitigate risks arising from those contracts and from the assets backing those contracts, relevant tax liabilities such as the deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences on liabilities arising from those contracts, and debt instruments issued that are included in the insurer\u2019s regulatory capital.\n\n# 20F\n\nIn assessing whether it engages in a significant activity unconnected with insurance for the purposes of applying paragraph 20D(b)(ii), an insurer shall consider:\n\n- (a) only those activities from which it may earn income and incur expenses; and\n- (b) quantitative or qualitative factors (or both), including publicly available information such as the industry classification that users of financial statements apply to the insurer.\n\n# 20G\n\nParagraph 20B(b) requires an entity to assess whether it qualifies for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 at its annual reporting date that immediately precedes 1 April 2016. After that date:\n\n- (a) an entity that previously qualified for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 shall reassess whether its activities are predominantly connected with insurance at a subsequent annual reporting date if, and only if, there was a change in the entity\u2019s activities, as described in paragraphs 20H\u201320I, during the annual period that ended on that date.\n- (b) an entity that previously did not qualify for the temporary exemption from AASB 9 is permitted to reassess whether its activities are predominantly connected with insurance at a subsequent annual reporting date before 31 December 2018 if, and only if, there was a change in the entity\u2019s activities, as described in paragraphs 20H\u201320I, during the annual period that ended on that date.\n\n# 20H\n\nFor the purposes of applying paragraph 20G, a change in an entity\u2019s activities is a change that:\n\n- (a) is determined by the entity\u2019s senior management as a result of external or internal changes;\n- (b) is significant to the entity\u2019s operations; and\n- (c) is demonstrable to external parties.\n\nAccordingly, such a change occurs only when the entity begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations or significantly changes the magnitude of one of its activities; for example, when the entity has acquired, disposed of or terminated a business line.\n\n# 20I\n\nA change in an entity\u2019s activities, as described in paragraph 20H, is expected to be very infrequent.

Nevertheless, for annual periods beginning before 1 January 2023, an entity is permitted, but not required, to retain the relevant accounting policies applied by the associate or joint venture as follows:\n\n- (a) the entity applies AASB 9 but the associate or joint venture applies the temporary exemption from AASB 9; or\n- (b) the entity applies the temporary exemption from AASB 9 but the associate or joint venture applies AASB 9.\n\n20P When an entity uses the equity method to account for its investment in an associate or joint venture:\n\n- (a) if AASB 9 was previously applied in the financial statements used to apply the equity method to that associate or joint venture (after reflecting any adjustments made by the entity), then AASB 9 shall continue to be applied.\n- (b) if the temporary exemption from AASB 9 was previously applied in the financial statements used to apply the equity method to that associate or joint venture (after reflecting any adjustments made by the entity), then AASB 9 may be subsequently applied.\n\n20Q An entity may apply paragraphs 20O and 20P(b) separately for each associate or joint venture.\n\n# Changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of interest rate benchmark reform\n\n20R An insurer applying the temporary exemption from AASB 9 shall apply the requirements in paragraphs 5.4.6\u20125.4.9 of AASB 9 to a financial asset or financial liability if, and only if, the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of that financial asset or financial liability changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. For this purpose, the term \u2018interest rate benchmark reform\u2019 refers to the market-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark as described in paragraph 102B of AASB 139.",

An insurer shall judge relevance and reliability by the criteria in AASB 108.\n\nTo justify changing its accounting policies for insurance contracts, an insurer shall show that the change brings its financial statements closer to meeting the criteria in AASB 108, but the change need not achieve full compliance with those criteria. The following specific issues are discussed below:\n\n- (a) current interest rates (paragraph 24);\n- (b) continuation of existing practices (paragraph 25);\n- (c) prudence (paragraph 26);\n- (d) future investment margins (paragraphs 27\u201329); and\n- (e) shadow accounting (paragraph 30).\n\nCurrent market interest rates\n\nAn insurer is permitted, but not required, to change its accounting policies so that it remeasures designated insurance liabilities to reflect current market interest rates and recognizes changes in those liabilities in profit or loss. At that time, it may also introduce accounting policies that require other current estimates and assumptions for the designated liabilities. The election in this paragraph permits an insurer to change its accounting policies for designated liabilities, without applying those policies consistently to all similar liabilities as AASB 108 would otherwise require. If an insurer designates liabilities for this election, it shall continue to apply current market interest rates (and, if applicable, the other current estimates and assumptions) consistently in all periods to all these liabilities until they are extinguished.\n\nContinuation of existing practices\n\nAn insurer may continue the following practices, but the introduction of any of them does not satisfy paragraph 22:\n\n- (a) measuring insurance liabilities on an undiscounted basis.\n- (b) measuring contractual rights to future investment management fees at an amount that exceeds their fair value as implied by a comparison with current fees charged by other market participants for similar services. It is likely that the fair value at inception of those contractual rights equals the origination costs paid, unless future investment management fees and related costs are out of line with market comparables.\n- (c) using non-uniform accounting policies for the insurance contracts (and related deferred acquisition costs and related intangible assets, if any) of subsidiaries, except as permitted by paragraph 24. If those accounting policies are not uniform, an insurer may change them if the change does not make the accounting policies more diverse and also satisfies the other requirements in this Standard.\n\nPrudence\n\nAn insurer need not change its accounting policies for insurance contracts to eliminate excessive prudence. However, if an insurer already measures its insurance contracts with sufficient prudence, it shall not introduce additional prudence.\n\nIn this paragraph, insurance liabilities include related deferred acquisition costs and related intangible assets, such as those discussed in paragraphs 31 and 32.",

        "text": "# Future investment margins\n\n|27|An insurer need not change its accounting policies for insurance contracts to eliminate future investment margins. However, there is a rebuttable presumption that an insurer\u2019s financial statements will become less relevant and reliable if it introduces an accounting policy that reflects future investment margins in the measurement of insurance contracts, unless those margins affect the contractual payments. Two examples of accounting policies that reflect those margins are:|\n|---|---|\n| |(a) using a discount rate that reflects the estimated return on the insurer\u2019s assets; or|\n| |(b) projecting the returns on those assets at an estimated rate of return, discounting those projected returns at a different rate and including the result in the measurement of the liability.|\n|28|An insurer may overcome the rebuttable presumption described in paragraph 27 if, and only if, the other components of a change in accounting policies increase the relevance and reliability of its financial statements sufficiently to outweigh the decrease in relevance and reliability caused by the inclusion of future investment margins. For example, suppose that an insurer\u2019s existing accounting policies for insurance contracts involve excessively prudent assumptions set at inception and a discount rate prescribed by a regulator without direct reference to market conditions, and ignore some embedded options and guarantees. The insurer might make its financial statements more relevant and no less reliable by switching to a comprehensive investor-oriented basis of accounting that is widely used and involves:|\n| |(a) current estimates and assumptions;|\n| |(b) a reasonable (but not excessively prudent) adjustment to reflect risk and uncertainty;|\n| |(c) measurements that reflect both the intrinsic value and time value of embedded options and guarantees; and|\n| |(d) a current market discount rate, even if that discount rate reflects the estimated return on the insurer\u2019s assets.|\n|29|In some measurement approaches, the discount rate is used to determine the present value of a future profit margin. That profit margin is then attributed to different periods using a formula. In those approaches, the discount rate affects the measurement of the liability only indirectly. In particular, the use of a less appropriate discount rate has a limited or no effect on the measurement of the liability at inception. However, in other approaches, the discount rate determines the measurement of the liability directly. In the latter case, because the introduction of an asset-based discount rate has a more significant effect, it is highly unlikely that an insurer could overcome the rebuttable presumption described in paragraph 27.|\n\n# Shadow accounting\n\nIn some accounting models, realised gains or losses on an insurer\u2019s assets have a direct effect on the measurement of some or all of (a) its insurance liabilities, (b) related deferred acquisition costs and (c) related intangible assets, such as those described in paragraphs 31 and 32. An insurer is permitted, but not required, to change its accounting policies so that a recognised but unrealised gain or loss on an asset affects those measurements in the same way that a realised gain or loss does. The related adjustment to the insurance liability (or deferred acquisition costs or intangible assets) shall be recognised in other comprehensive income if, and only if, the unrealised gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. This practice is sometimes described as \u2018shadow accounting\u2019.\n\n# Insurance contracts acquired in a business combination or portfolio transfer\n\nTo comply with AASB 3, an insurer shall, at the acquisition date, measure at fair value the insurance liabilities assumed and insurance assets acquired in a business combination. However, an insurer is permitted, but not required, to use an expanded presentation that splits the fair value of acquired insurance contracts into two components:\n\n|(a)|a liability measured in accordance with the insurer\u2019s accounting policies for insurance contracts that it issues;|\n|---|---|\n|(b)|an intangible asset, representing the difference between (i) the fair value of the contractual insurance rights acquired and insurance obligations assumed and (ii) the amount described in (a). The subsequent measurement of this asset shall be consistent with the measurement of the related insurance liability.|",

The issuer of such a contract:(a) may, but need not, recognise the guaranteed element separately from the discretionary participation feature. If the issuer does not recognise them separately, it shall classify the whole contract as a liability. If the issuer classifies them separately, it shall classify the guaranteed element as a liability.(b) shall, if it recognises the discretionary participation feature separately from the guaranteed element, classify that feature as either a liability or a separate component of equity. This Standard does not specify how the issuer determines whether that feature is a liability or equity. The issuer may split that feature into liability and equity components and shall use a consistent accounting policy for that split. The issuer shall not classify that feature as an intermediate category that is neither liability nor equity.(c) may recognise all premiums received as revenue without separating any portion that relates to the equity component. The resulting changes in the guaranteed element and in the portion of the discretionary participation feature classified as a liability shall be recognised in profit or loss. If part or all of the discretionary participation feature is classified in equity, a portion of profit or loss may be attributable to that feature (in the same way that a portion may be attributable to non-controlling interests). The issuer shall recognise the portion of profit or loss attributable to any equity component of a discretionary participation feature as an allocation of profit or loss, not as expense or income (see AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements).(d) shall, if the contract contains an embedded derivative within the scope of AASB 9, apply AASB 9 to that embedded derivative.(e) shall, in all respects not described in paragraphs 14\u201320 and 34(a)\u2013(d), continue its existing accounting policies for such contracts, unless it changes those accounting policies in a way that complies with paragraphs 21\u201330.\n\n# Discretionary participation features in financial instruments\n\nThe requirements in paragraph 34 also apply to a financial instrument that contains a discretionary participation feature. In addition:(a) if the issuer classifies the entire discretionary participation feature as a liability, it shall apply the liability adequacy test in paragraphs 15\u201319 to the whole contract (ie both the guaranteed element and the discretionary participation feature). The issuer need not determine the amount that would result from applying AASB 9 to the guaranteed element.(b) if the issuer classifies part or all of that feature as a separate component of equity, the liability recognised for the whole contract shall not be less than the amount that would result from applying AASB 9 to the guaranteed element. That amount shall include the intrinsic value of an option to surrender the contract, but need not include its time value if paragraph 9 exempts that option from measurement at fair value. The issuer need not disclose the amount that would result from applying AASB 9 to the guaranteed element, nor need it present that amount separately. Furthermore, the issuer need not determine that amount if the total liability recognised is clearly higher.(c) although these contracts are financial instruments, the issuer may continue to recognise the premiums for those contracts as revenue and recognise as an expense the resulting increase in the carrying amount of the liability.",

        "text": "# Appendix B\n\nDefinition of an insurance contract\n\nThis appendix is an integral part of the Standard.\n\n# B1\n\nThis appendix gives guidance on the definition of an insurance contract in Appendix A. It addresses the following issues:\n\n- (a) the term \u2018uncertain future event\u2019 (paragraphs B2\u2013B4);\n- (b) payments in kind (paragraphs B5\u2013B7);\n- (c) insurance risk and other risks (paragraphs B8\u2013B17);\n- (d) examples of insurance contracts (paragraphs B18\u2013B21);\n- (e) significant insurance risk (paragraphs B22\u2013B28); and\n- (f) changes in the level of insurance risk (paragraphs B29 and B30).\n\n# Uncertain future event\n\nB2 Uncertainty (or risk) is the essence of an insurance contract. Accordingly, at least one of the following is uncertain at the inception of an insurance contract:\n\n- (a) whether an insured event will occur;\n- (b) when it will occur; or\n- (c) how much the insurer will need to pay if it occurs.\n\nB3 In some insurance contracts, the insured event is the discovery of a loss during the term of the contract, even if the loss arises from an event that occurred before the inception of the contract. In other insurance contracts, the insured event is an event that occurs during the term of the contract, even if the resulting loss is discovered after the end of the contract term.\n\nB4 Some insurance contracts cover events that have already occurred, but whose financial effect is still uncertain. An example is a reinsurance contract that covers the direct insurer against adverse development of claims already reported by policyholders. In such contracts, the insured event is the discovery of the ultimate cost of those claims.\n\n# Payments in kind\n\nB5 Some insurance contracts require or permit payments to be made in kind. An example is when the insurer replaces a stolen article directly, instead of reimbursing the policyholder. Another example is when an insurer uses its own hospitals and medical staff to provide medical services covered by the contracts.\n\nB6 Some fixed-fee service contracts in which the level of service depends on an uncertain event meet the definition of an insurance contract in this Standard but are not regulated as insurance contracts in some countries. One example is a maintenance contract in which the service provider agrees to repair specified equipment after a malfunction. The fixed service fee is based on the expected number of malfunctions, but it is uncertain whether a particular machine will break down. The malfunction of the equipment adversely affects its owner and the contract compensates the owner (in kind, rather than cash). Another example is a contract for car breakdown services in which the provider agrees, for a fixed annual fee, to provide roadside assistance or tow the car to a nearby garage. The latter contract could meet the definition of an insurance contract even if the provider does not agree to carry out repairs or replace parts.\n\nB7 Applying the Standard to the contracts described in paragraph B6 is likely to be no more burdensome than applying the Australian Accounting Standards that would be applicable if such contracts were outside the scope of this Standard:\n\n- (a) There are unlikely to be material liabilities for malfunctions and breakdowns that have already occurred.\n- (b) If AASB 15 applied, the service provider would recognise revenue when (or as) it transfers services to the customer (subject to other specified criteria). That approach is also acceptable under this Standard, which permits the service provider (i) to continue its existing accounting policies for these contracts unless they involve practices prohibited by paragraph 14 and (ii) to improve its accounting policies if so permitted by paragraphs 22\u201330.",

        "text": "(c) The service provider considers whether the cost of meeting its contractual obligation to provide services exceeds the revenue received in advance. To do this, it applies the liability adequacy test described in paragraphs 15\u201319 of this Standard. If this Standard did not apply to these contracts, the service provider would apply AASB 137 to determine whether the contracts are onerous.\n\n(d) For these contracts, the disclosure requirements in this Standard are unlikely to add significantly to disclosures required by other Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n# Distinction between insurance risk and other risks\n\n|B8|The definition of an insurance contract refers to insurance risk, which this Standard defines as risk, other than financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the issuer. A contract that exposes the issuer to financial risk without significant insurance risk is not an insurance contract.|\n|---|---|\n|B9|The definition of financial risk in Appendix A includes a list of financial and non-financial variables. That list includes non-financial variables that are not specific to a party to the contract, such as an index of earthquake losses in a particular region or an index of temperatures in a particular city. It excludes non-financial variables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of that party. Furthermore, the risk of changes in the fair value of a non-financial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects not only changes in market prices for such assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a party to a contract (a non-financial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car\u2019s physical condition, that risk is insurance risk, not financial risk.|\n|B10|Some contracts expose the issuer to financial risk, in addition to significant insurance risk. For example, many life insurance contracts both guarantee a minimum rate of return to policyholders (creating financial risk) and promise death benefits that at some times significantly exceed the policyholder\u2019s account balance (creating insurance risk in the form of mortality risk). Such contracts are insurance contracts.|\n|B11|Under some contracts, an insured event triggers the payment of an amount linked to a price index. Such contracts are insurance contracts, provided the payment that is contingent on the insured event can be significant. For example, a life-contingent annuity linked to a cost-of-living index transfers insurance risk because payment is triggered by an uncertain event\u2014the survival of the annuitant. The link to the price index is an embedded derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk. If the resulting transfer of insurance risk is significant, the embedded derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract, in which case it need not be separated and measured at fair value (see paragraph 7 of this Standard).|\n|B12|The definition of insurance risk refers to risk that the insurer accepts from the policyholder. In other words, insurance risk is a pre-existing risk transferred from the policyholder to the insurer. Thus, a new risk created by the contract is not insurance risk.|\n|B13|The definition of an insurance contract refers to an adverse effect on the policyholder. The definition does not limit the payment by the insurer to an amount equal to the financial impact of the adverse event. For example, the definition does not exclude \u2018new-for-old\u2019 coverage that pays the policyholder sufficient to permit replacement of a damaged old asset by a new asset. Similarly, the definition does not limit payment under a term life insurance contract to the financial loss suffered by the deceased\u2019s dependants, nor does it preclude the payment of predetermined amounts to quantify the loss caused by death or an accident.|\n|B14|Some contracts require a payment if a specified uncertain event occurs, but do not require an adverse effect on the policyholder as a precondition for payment. Such a contract is not an insurance contract even if the holder uses the contract to mitigate an underlying risk exposure. For example, if the holder uses a derivative to hedge an underlying non-financial variable that is correlated with cash flows from an asset of the entity, the derivative is not an insurance contract because payment is not conditional on whether the holder is adversely affected by a reduction in the cash flows from the asset. Conversely, the definition of an insurance contract refers to an uncertain event for which an adverse effect on the policyholder is a contractual precondition for payment. This contractual precondition does not require the insurer to investigate whether the event actually caused an adverse effect, but permits the insurer to deny payment if it is not satisfied that the event caused an adverse effect.|\n|B15|Lapse or persistency risk (ie the risk that the counterparty will cancel the contract earlier or later than the issuer had expected in pricing the contract) is not insurance risk because the payment to the counterparty is not contingent on an uncertain future event that adversely affects the counterparty. Similarly, expense risk (ie the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract, rather than in costs associated with insured events) is not insurance risk because an unexpected increase in expenses does not adversely affect the counterparty.|",

        "text": "# B16\n\nTherefore, a contract that exposes the issuer to lapse risk, persistency risk or expense risk is not an insurance contract unless it also exposes the issuer to insurance risk. However, if the issuer of that contract mitigates that risk by using a second contract to transfer part of that risk to another party, the second contract exposes that other party to insurance risk.\n\n# B17\n\nAn insurer can accept significant insurance risk from the policyholder only if the insurer is an entity separate from the policyholder. In the case of a mutual insurer, the mutual accepts risk from each policyholder and pools that risk. Although policyholders bear that pooled risk collectively in their capacity as owners, the mutual has still accepted the risk that is the essence of an insurance contract.\n\n# Examples of insurance contracts\n\nExamples of insurance contracts(a) insurance against theft or damage to property.(b) insurance against product liability, professional liability, civil liability or legal expenses.(c) life insurance and prepaid funeral plans (although death is certain, it is uncertain when death will occur or, for some types of life insurance, whether death will occur within the period covered by the insurance).(d) life-contingent annuities and pensions (ie contracts that provide compensation for the uncertain future event\u2014the survival of the annuitant or pensioner\u2014to assist the annuitant or pensioner in maintaining a given standard of living, which would otherwise be adversely affected by his or her survival).(e) disability and medical cover.(f) surety bonds, fidelity bonds, performance bonds and bid bonds (ie contracts that provide compensation if another party fails to perform a contractual obligation, for example an obligation to construct a building).(g) credit insurance that provides for specified payments to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. These contracts could have various legal forms, such as that of a guarantee, some types of letter of credit, a credit derivative default contract or an insurance contract. However, although these contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract, they also meet the definition of a financial guarantee contract in AASB 9 and are within the scope of AASB 1324 and AASB 9, not this Standard (see paragraph 4(d)). Nevertheless, if an issuer of financial guarantee contracts has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts, the issuer may elect to apply either AASB 1325 and AASB 9 or AASB 1023 to such financial guarantee contracts.(h) product warranties. Product warranties issued by another party for goods sold by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer are within the scope of this Standard. However, product warranties issued directly by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer are outside its scope, because they are within the scope of AASB 15 and AASB 137.(i) title insurance (ie insurance against the discovery of defects in title to land that were not apparent when the insurance contract was written). In this case, the insured event is the discovery of a defect in the title, not the defect itself.(j) travel assistance (ie compensation in cash or in kind to policyholders for losses suffered while they are travelling). Paragraphs B6 and B7 discuss some contracts of this kind.(k) catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both if a specified event adversely affects the issuer of the bond (unless the specified event does not create significant insurance risk, for example if the event is a change in an interest rate or foreign exchange rate).(l) insurance swaps and other contracts that require a payment based on changes in climatic, geological or other physical variables that are specific to a party to the contract.(m) reinsurance contracts.\n\nWhen an entity applies AASB 7, the reference to AASB 132 is replaced by a reference to AASB 7.\n\nWhen an entity applies AASB 7, the reference to AASB 132 is replaced by a reference to AASB 7.",

However, this does not preclude the specification of a predetermined payout to quantify the loss caused by a specified event such as death or an accident (see also paragraph B13).|\n|(e)|derivatives that expose one party to financial risk but not insurance risk, because they require that party to make payment based solely on changes in one or more of a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract (see AASB 9).|\n|(f)|a credit-related guarantee (or letter of credit, credit derivative default contract or credit insurance contract) that requires payments even if the holder has not incurred a loss on the failure of the debtor to make payments when due (see AASB 9).|\n|(g)|contracts that require a payment based on a climatic, geological or other physical variable that is not specific to a party to the contract (commonly described as weather derivatives).|\n|(h)|catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, based on a climatic, geological or other physical variable that is not specific to a party to the contract.|\n\n# B20\n\nIf the contracts described in paragraph B19 create financial assets or financial liabilities, they are within the scope of AASB 9. Among other things, this means that the parties to the contract use what is sometimes called deposit accounting, which involves the following:\n\n|(a)|one party recognises the consideration received as a financial liability, rather than as revenue.|\n|---|---|\n|(b)|the other party recognises the consideration paid as a financial asset, rather than as an expense.|\n\n# B21\n\nIf the contracts described in paragraph B19 do not create financial assets or financial liabilities, AASB 15 applies. Under AASB 15, revenue is recognised when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled.\n\n# Significant insurance risk\n\n# B22\n\nA contract is an insurance contract only if it transfers significant insurance risk. Paragraphs B8\u2013B21 discuss insurance risk. The following paragraphs discuss the assessment of whether insurance risk is significant.\n\n# B23\n\nInsurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant additional benefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance (ie have no discernible effect on the economics of the transaction). If significant additional benefits would be payable in scenarios that have commercial substance, the condition in the previous sentence may be met even if the insured event is extremely unlikely or even if the expected (ie probability-weighted) present value of contingent cash flows is a small proportion of the expected present value of all the remaining contractual cash flows.\n\n# B24\n\nThe additional benefits described in paragraph B23 refer to amounts that exceed those that would be payable if no insured event occurred (excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance). Those additional amounts include claims handling and claims assessment costs, but exclude:\n\n- the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future services. For example, in an investment-linked life insurance contract, the death of the policyholder means that the insurer can no longer perform investment management services and collect a fee for doing so.

        "text": "(b) waiver on death of charges that would be made on cancellation or surrender. Because the contract brought those charges into existence, the waiver of these charges does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk. Hence, they are not relevant in assessing how much insurance risk is transferred by a contract.\n\n(c) a payment conditional on an event that does not cause a significant loss to the holder of the contract. For example, consider a contract that requires the issuer to pay one million currency units if an asset suffers physical damage causing an insignificant economic loss of one currency unit to the holder. In this contract, the holder transfers to the insurer the insignificant risk of losing one currency unit. At the same time, the contract creates non-insurance risk that the issuer will need to pay 999,999 currency units if the specified event occurs. Because the issuer does not accept significant insurance risk from the holder, this contract is not an insurance contract.\n\n(d) possible reinsurance recoveries. The insurer accounts for these separately.\n\nB25\nAn insurer shall assess the significance of insurance risk contract by contract, rather than by reference to materiality to the financial statements. Thus, insurance risk may be significant even if there is a minimal probability of material losses for a whole book of contracts. This contract-by-contract assessment makes it easier to classify a contract as an insurance contract. However, if a relatively homogeneous book of small contracts is known to consist of contracts that all transfer insurance risk, an insurer need not examine each contract within that book to identify a few non-derivative contracts that transfer insignificant insurance risk.\n\nB26 It follows from paragraphs B23\u2013B25 that if a contract pays a death benefit exceeding the amount payable on survival, the contract is an insurance contract unless the additional death benefit is insignificant (judged by reference to the contract rather than to an entire book of contracts). As noted in paragraph B24(b), the waiver on death of cancellation or surrender charges is not included in this assessment if this waiver does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk. Similarly, an annuity contract that pays out regular sums for the rest of a policyholder\u2019s life is an insurance contract, unless the aggregate life-contingent payments are insignificant.\n\nB27 Paragraph B23 refers to additional benefits. These additional benefits could include a requirement to pay benefits earlier if the insured event occurs earlier and the payment is not adjusted for the time value of money. An example is whole life insurance for a fixed amount (in other words, insurance that provides a fixed death benefit whenever the policyholder dies, with no expiry date for the cover). It is certain that the policyholder will die, but the date of death is uncertain. The insurer will suffer a loss on those individual contracts for which policyholders die early, even if there is no overall loss on the whole book of contracts.\n\nB28 If an insurance contract is unbundled into a deposit component and an insurance component, the significance of insurance risk transfer is assessed by reference to the insurance component. The significance of insurance risk transferred by an embedded derivative is assessed by reference to the embedded derivative.\n\n# Changes in the level of insurance risk\n\nB29 Some contracts do not transfer any insurance risk to the issuer at inception, although they do transfer insurance risk at a later time. For example, consider a contract that provides a specified investment return and includes an option for the policyholder to use the proceeds of the investment on maturity to buy a life-contingent annuity at the current annuity rates charged by the insurer to other new annuitants when the policyholder exercises the option. The contract transfers no insurance risk to the issuer until the option is exercised, because the insurer remains free to price the annuity on a basis that reflects the insurance risk transferred to the insurer at that time. However, if the contract specifies the annuity rates (or a basis for setting the annuity rates), the contract transfers insurance risk to the issuer at inception.\n\nB30 A contract that qualifies as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.",
