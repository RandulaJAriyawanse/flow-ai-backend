        "page_content=": "## Scope  \n2 An entity shall apply this Standard in accounting for all share-based payment transactions, whether or not\nthe entity can identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received, including:  \n(a) _equity-settled share-based payment transactions,_  \n(b) _cash-settled share-based payment transactions, and_  \n(c) transactions in which the entity receives or acquires goods or services and the terms of the\narrangement provide either the entity or the supplier of those goods or services with a choice of\nwhether the entity settles the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by issuing equity instruments,  \nexcept as noted in paragraphs 3A\u20136. In the absence of specifically identifiable goods or services, other\ncircumstances may indicate that goods or services have been (or will be) received, in which case this\nStandard applies.  \n3 [Deleted]  \n3A A share-based payment transaction may be settled by another group entity (or a shareholder of any group\nentity) on behalf of the entity receiving or acquiring the goods or services. Paragraph 2 also applies to an\nentity that  \n(a) receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group\nentity) has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction, or  \n(b) has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same\ngroup receives the goods or services  \nunless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity\nreceiving them.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE5-->4 For the purposes of this Standard, a transaction with an employee (or other party) in his/her capacity as a\nholder of equity instruments of the entity is not a share-based payment transaction. For example, if an entity\ngrants all holders of a particular class of its equity instruments the right to acquire additional equity\ninstruments of the entity at a price that is less than the fair value of those equity instruments, and an\nemployee receives such a right because he/she is a holder of equity instruments of that particular class, the\ngranting or exercise of that right is not subject to the requirements of this Standard.  \n5 As noted in paragraph 2, this Standard applies to share-based payment transactions in which an entity\nacquires or receives goods or services. Goods includes inventories, consumables, property, plant and\nequipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets. However, an entity shall not apply this Standard\nto transactions in which the entity acquires goods as part of the net assets acquired in a business\ncombination as defined by AASB 3 Business Combinations, in a combination of entities or businesses under\ncommon control as described in paragraphs B1\u2013B4 of AASB 3, or the contribution of a business on the\nformation of a joint venture as defined by AASB 11 Joint Arrangements. Hence, equity instruments issued\nin a business combination in exchange for control of the acquiree are not within the scope of this Standard.\nHowever, equity instruments granted to employees of the acquiree in their capacity as employees (eg in\nreturn for continued service) are within the scope of this Standard. Similarly, the cancellation, replacement\nor other modification of _share-based payment arrangements because of a business combination or other_\nequity restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this Standard. AASB 3 provides guidance on\ndetermining whether equity instruments issued in a business combination are part of the consideration\ntransferred in exchange for control of the acquiree (and therefore within the scope of AASB 3) or are in\nreturn for continued service to be recognised in the post-combination period (and therefore within the scope\nof this Standard).  \n6 This Standard does not apply to share-based payment transactions in which the entity receives or acquires\ngoods or services under a contract within the scope of paragraphs 8\u201310 of AASB 132 _Financial_\n_Instruments: Presentation[1] or paragraphs 2.4\u20132.7 of AASB 9 Financial Instruments._  \n6A This Standard uses the term \u2018fair value\u2019 in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of fair\nvalue in AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement. Therefore, when applying AASB 2 an entity measures fair_\nvalue in accordance with this Standard, not AASB 13.",

The fair value of those equity instruments shall be\nmeasured at grant date.  \n12 Typically, shares, share options or other equity instruments are granted to employees as part of their\nremuneration package, in addition to a cash salary and other employment benefits. Usually, it is not possible\nto measure directly the services received for particular components of the employee\u2019s remuneration\npackage. It might also not be possible to measure the fair value of the total remuneration package\nindependently, without measuring directly the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Furthermore,\nshares or share options are sometimes granted as part of a bonus arrangement, rather than as a part of basic\nremuneration, eg as an incentive to the employees to remain in the entity\u2019s employ or to reward them for\ntheir efforts in improving the entity\u2019s performance. By granting shares or share options, in addition to other\nremuneration, the entity is paying additional remuneration to obtain additional benefits. Estimating the fair\nvalue of those additional benefits is likely to be difficult. Because of the difficulty of measuring directly the\nfair value of the services received, the entity shall measure the fair value of the employee services received\nby reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.  \n13 To apply the requirements of paragraph 10 to transactions with parties other than employees, there shall be\na rebuttable presumption that the fair value of the goods or services received can be estimated reliably. That\nfair value shall be measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service. In\nrare cases, if the entity rebuts this presumption because it cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the\ngoods or services received, the entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding\nincrease in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at\nthe date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.  \n13A In particular, if the identifiable consideration received (if any) by the entity appears to be less than the fair\nvalue of the equity instruments granted or liability incurred, typically this situation indicates that other\nconsideration (ie unidentifiable goods or services) has been (or will be) received by the entity. The entity\nshall measure the identifiable goods or services received in accordance with this Standard. The entity shall\nmeasure the unidentifiable goods or services received (or to be received) as the difference between the fair\nvalue of the share-based payment and the fair value of any identifiable goods or services received (or to be\nreceived). The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received at the grant date. However,\nfor cash-settled transactions, the liability shall be remeasured at the end of each reporting period until it is\nsettled in accordance with paragraphs 30\u201333.",

In the absence of\nevidence to the contrary, the entity shall presume that services rendered by the counterparty as consideration\nfor the equity instruments have been received. In this case, on grant date the entity shall recognise the\nservices received in full, with a corresponding increase in equity.  \n15 If the equity instruments granted do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of service,\nthe entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the counterparty as consideration for those\nequity instruments will be received in the future, during the _vesting period. The entity shall account for_\nthose services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the vesting period, with a corresponding\nincrease in equity. For example:  \n(a) if an employee is granted share options conditional upon completing three years\u2019 service, then the\nentity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the employee as consideration for the\nshare options will be received in the future, over that three-year vesting period.  \n(b) if an employee is granted share options conditional upon the achievement of a _performance_\n_condition and remaining in the entity\u2019s employ until that performance condition is satisfied, and_\nthe length of the vesting period varies depending on when that performance condition is satisfied,  \n2 This Standard uses the phrase \u2018by reference to\u2019 rather than \u2018at\u2019, because the transaction is ultimately measured by multiplying the fair\nvalue of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date specified in paragraph 11 or 13 (whichever is applicable), by the number\nof equity instruments that vest, as explained in paragraph 19.  \n3 In the remainder of this Standard, all references to employees also include others providing similar services.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE7-->the entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the employee as consideration for the\nshare options will be received in the future, over the expected vesting period.

        "page_content=": "## Transactions measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted  \n**Determining the fair value of equity instruments granted**  \n16 For transactions measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, an entity shall\nmeasure the fair value of equity instruments granted at the _measurement date, based on market prices if_\navailable, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which those equity instruments were granted\n(subject to the requirements of paragraphs 19\u201322).  \n17 If market prices are not available, the entity shall estimate the fair value of the equity instruments granted\nusing a valuation technique to estimate what the price of those equity instruments would have been on the\nmeasurement date in an arm\u2019s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. The valuation\ntechnique shall be consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies for pricing financial\ninstruments, and shall incorporate all factors and assumptions that knowledgeable, willing market\nparticipants would consider in setting the price (subject to the requirements of paragraphs 19\u201322).  \n18 Appendix B contains further guidance on the measurement of the fair value of shares and share options,\nfocusing on the specific terms and conditions that are common features of a grant of shares or share options\nto employees.  \n**Treatment of vesting conditions**  \n19 A grant of equity instruments might be conditional upon satisfying specified vesting conditions. For\nexample, a grant of shares or share options to an employee is typically conditional on the employee\nremaining in the entity\u2019s employ for a specified period of time. There might be performance conditions that\nmust be satisfied, such as the entity achieving a specified growth in profit or a specified increase in the\nentity\u2019s share price. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall not be taken into account when\nestimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the measurement date. Instead, vesting conditions,\nother than market conditions, shall be taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments\nincluded in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for goods\nor services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of\nequity instruments that eventually vest. Hence, on a cumulative basis, no amount is recognised for goods or\nservices received if the equity instruments granted do not vest because of failure to satisfy a _vesting_\n_condition, other than a market condition, for example, the counterparty fails to complete a specified service_\nperiod, or a performance condition is not satisfied, subject to the requirements of paragraph 21.  \n20 To apply the requirements of paragraph 19, the entity shall recognise an amount for the goods or services\nreceived during the vesting period based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments\nexpected to vest and shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the\nnumber of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On vesting date, the entity\nshall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested, subject to the\nrequirements of paragraph 21.  \n21 Market conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or exercisability) is conditioned, shall\nbe taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants\nof equity instruments with market conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received from\na counterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (eg services received from an employee who\nremains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether that market condition is\nsatisfied.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE8-->**Treatment of non-vesting conditions**  \n21A Similarly, an entity shall take into account all non-vesting conditions when estimating the fair value of the\nequity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions, the\nentity shall recognise the goods or services received from a counterparty that satisfies all vesting conditions\nthat are not market conditions (eg services received from an employee who remains in service for the\nspecified period of service), irrespective of whether those non-vesting conditions are satisfied.  \n**Treatment of a reload feature**  \n22 For options with a reload feature, the reload feature shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair\nvalue of options granted at the measurement date. Instead, a reload option shall be accounted for as a new\noption grant, if and when a reload option is subsequently granted.  \n**After vesting date**  \n23 Having recognised the goods or services received in accordance with paragraphs 10\u201322, and a\ncorresponding increase in equity, the entity shall make no subsequent adjustment to total equity after\nvesting date. For example, the entity shall not subsequently reverse the amount recognised for services\nreceived from an employee if the vested equity instruments are later forfeited or, in the case of share\noptions, the options are not exercised. However, this requirement does not preclude the entity from\nrecognising a transfer within equity, ie a transfer from one component of equity to another.  \n**If the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be estimated reliably**  \n24 The requirements in paragraphs 16\u201323 apply when the entity is required to measure a share-based payment\ntransaction by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. In rare cases, the entity may be\nunable to estimate reliably the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the measurement date, in\naccordance with the requirements in paragraphs 16\u201322. In these rare cases only, the entity shall instead:  \n(a) measure the equity instruments at their _intrinsic value, initially at the date the entity obtains the_\ngoods or the counterparty renders service and subsequently at the end of each reporting period\nand at the date of final settlement, with any change in intrinsic value recognised in profit or loss.\nFor a grant of share options, the share-based payment arrangement is finally settled when the\noptions are exercised, are forfeited (eg upon cessation of employment) or lapse (eg at the end of\nthe option\u2019s life).  \n(b) recognise the goods or services received based on the number of equity instruments that\nultimately vest or (where applicable) are ultimately exercised. To apply this requirement to share\noptions, for example, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received during the vesting\nperiod, if any, in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 15, except that the requirements in\nparagraph 15(b) concerning a market condition do not apply. The amount recognised for goods or\nservices received during the vesting period shall be based on the number of share options\nexpected to vest. The entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information\nindicates that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On\nvesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that\nultimately vested. After vesting date, the entity shall reverse the amount recognised for goods or\nservices received if the share options are later forfeited, or lapse at the end of the share option\u2019s\nlife.  \n25 If an entity applies paragraph 24, it is not necessary to apply paragraphs 26\u201329, because any modifications\nto the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted will be taken into account when\napplying the intrinsic value method set out in paragraph 24. However, if an entity settles a grant of equity\ninstruments to which paragraph 24 has been applied:  \n(a) if the settlement occurs during the vesting period, the entity shall account for the settlement as an\nacceleration of vesting, and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that would\notherwise have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.  \n(b) any payment made on settlement shall be accounted for as the repurchase of equity instruments,\nie as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the intrinsic value of\nthe equity instruments, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as\nan expense.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE9-->## Modifications to the terms and conditions on which equity instruments were granted, including cancellations and settlements  \n26 An entity might modify the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted. For\nexample, it might reduce the exercise price of options granted to employees (ie reprice the options), which\nincreases the fair value of those options. The requirements in paragraphs 27\u201329 to account for the effects of\nmodifications are expressed in the context of share-based payment transactions with employees. However,\nthe requirements shall also be applied to share-based payment transactions with parties other than\nemployees that are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. In the latter\ncase, any references in paragraphs 27\u201329 to grant date shall instead refer to the date the entity obtains the\ngoods or the counterparty renders service.  \n27 The entity shall recognise, as a minimum, the services received measured at the grant date fair value of the\nequity instruments granted, unless those equity instruments do not vest because of failure to satisfy a\nvesting condition (other than a market condition) that was specified at grant date. This applies irrespective\nof any modifications to the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted, or a\ncancellation or settlement of that grant of equity instruments. In addition, the entity shall recognise the\neffects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or are\notherwise beneficial to the employee. Guidance on applying this requirement is given in Appendix B.  \n28 If a grant of equity instruments is cancelled or settled during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled\nby forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied):  \n(a) the entity shall account for the cancellation or settlement as an acceleration of vesting, and shall\ntherefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for\nservices received over the remainder of the vesting period.  \n(b) any payment made to the employee on the cancellation or settlement of the grant shall be\naccounted for as the repurchase of an equity interest, ie as a deduction from equity, except to the\nextent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the\nrepurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense. However, if the share-based\npayment arrangement included liability components, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of\nthe liability at the date of cancellation or settlement. Any payment made to settle the liability\ncomponent shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the liability.  \n(c) if new equity instruments are granted to the employee and, on the date when those new equity\ninstruments are granted, the entity identifies the new equity instruments granted as replacement\nequity instruments for the cancelled equity instruments, the entity shall account for the granting\nof replacement equity instruments in the same way as a modification of the original grant of\nequity instruments, in accordance with paragraph 27 and the guidance in Appendix B. The\nincremental fair value granted is the difference between the fair value of the replacement equity\ninstruments and the net fair value of the cancelled equity instruments, at the date the replacement\nequity instruments are granted. The net fair value of the cancelled equity instruments is their fair\nvalue, immediately before the cancellation, less the amount of any payment made to the employee\non cancellation of the equity instruments that is accounted for as a deduction from equity in\naccordance with (b) above. If the entity does not identify new equity instruments granted as\nreplacement equity instruments for the cancelled equity instruments, the entity shall account for\nthose new equity instruments as a new grant of equity instruments.  \n28A If an entity or counterparty can choose whether to meet a non-vesting condition, the entity shall treat the\nentity\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s failure to meet that non-vesting condition during the vesting period as a\ncancellation.  \n29 If an entity repurchases vested equity instruments, the payment made to the employee shall be accounted for\nas a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity\ninstruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as an\nexpense.",

Alternatively, an entity might grant to its employees a right to receive a future cash payment by\ngranting to them a right to shares (including shares to be issued upon the exercise of share options) that are\nredeemable, either mandatorily (for example, upon cessation of employment) or at the employee\u2019s option.\nThese arrangements are examples of cash-settled share-based payment transactions.

In\nthe absence of evidence to the contrary, the entity shall presume that the services rendered by the employees\nin exchange for the share appreciation rights have been received. Thus, the entity shall recognise\nimmediately the services received and a liability to pay for them.

For\ntransactions with parties other than employees, in which the fair value of the goods or services received is\nmeasured directly, the entity shall measure the equity component of the compound financial instrument as\nthe difference between the fair value of the goods or services received and the fair value of the debt\ncomponent, at the date when the goods or services are received.  \n36 For other transactions, including transactions with employees, the entity shall measure the fair value of the\ncompound financial instrument at the measurement date, taking into account the terms and conditions on\nwhich the rights to cash or equity instruments were granted.  \n37 To apply paragraph 36, the entity shall first measure the fair value of the debt component, and then measure\nthe fair value of the equity component\u2014taking into account that the counterparty must forfeit the right to\nreceive cash in order to receive the equity instrument. The fair value of the compound financial instrument\nis the sum of the fair values of the two components. However, share-based payment transactions in which\nthe counterparty has the choice of settlement are often structured so that the fair value of one settlement\nalternative is the same as the other. For example, the counterparty might have the choice of receiving share\noptions or cash-settled share appreciation rights. In such cases, the fair value of the equity component is\nzero, and hence the fair value of the compound financial instrument is the same as the fair value of the debt\ncomponent. Conversely, if the fair values of the settlement alternatives differ, the fair value of the equity\ncomponent usually will be greater than zero, in which case the fair value of the compound financial\ninstrument will be greater than the fair value of the debt component.  \n38 The entity shall account separately for the goods or services received or acquired in respect of each\ncomponent of the compound financial instrument. For the debt component, the entity shall recognise the\ngoods or services acquired, and a liability to pay for those goods or services, as the counterparty supplies  \n4 In paragraphs 35\u201343, all references to cash also include other assets of the entity.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE12-->goods or renders service, in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled share-based payment\ntransactions (paragraphs 30\u201333).

If the entity issues equity\ninstruments on settlement rather than paying cash, the liability shall be transferred direct to equity, as the\nconsideration for the equity instruments issued.  \n40 If the entity pays in cash on settlement rather than issuing equity instruments, that payment shall be applied\nto settle the liability in full. Any equity component previously recognised shall remain within equity. By\nelecting to receive cash on settlement, the counterparty forfeited the right to receive equity instruments.\nHowever, this requirement does not preclude the entity from recognising a transfer within equity, ie a\ntransfer from one component of equity to another.",

        "page_content=": "## Estimating the fair value of equity instruments granted  \nB1 Paragraphs B2\u2013B41 of this appendix discuss measurement of the fair value of shares and share options\ngranted, focusing on the specific terms and conditions that are common features of a grant of shares or share\noptions to employees. Therefore, it is not exhaustive. Furthermore, because the valuation issues discussed\nbelow focus on shares and share options granted to employees, it is assumed that the fair value of the shares\nor share options is measured at grant date. However, many of the valuation issues discussed below (eg\ndetermining expected volatility) also apply in the context of estimating the fair value of shares or share\noptions granted to parties other than employees at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty\nrenders service.  \n**Shares**  \nB2 For shares granted to employees, the fair value of the shares shall be measured at the market price of the\nentity\u2019s shares (or an estimated market price, if the entity\u2019s shares are not publicly traded), adjusted to take\ninto account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted (except for vesting conditions\nthat are excluded from the measurement of fair value in accordance with paragraphs 19\u201321).  \nB3 For example, if the employee is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, this factor shall\nbe taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted. Similarly, if the shares are\nsubject to restrictions on transfer after vesting date, that factor shall be taken into account, but only to the\nextent that the post-vesting restrictions affect the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant\nwould pay for that share. For example, if the shares are actively traded in a deep and liquid market, postvesting transfer restrictions may have little, if any, effect on the price that a knowledgeable, willing market\nparticipant would pay for those shares. Restrictions on transfer or other restrictions that exist during the\nvesting period shall not be taken into account when estimating the grant date fair value of the shares\ngranted, because those restrictions stem from the existence of vesting conditions, which are accounted for in\naccordance with paragraphs 19\u201321.  \n**Share options**  \nB4 For share options granted to employees, in many cases market prices are not available, because the options\ngranted are subject to terms and conditions that do not apply to traded options. If traded options with similar\nterms and conditions do not exist, the fair value of the options granted shall be estimated by applying an\noption pricing model.  \nB5 The entity shall consider factors that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in selecting\nthe option pricing model to apply. For example, many employee options have long lives, are usually\nexercisable during the period between vesting date and the end of the options\u2019 life, and are often exercised\nearly. These factors should be considered when estimating the grant date fair value of the options. For many\nentities, this might preclude the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, which does not allow for the\npossibility of exercise before the end of the option\u2019s life and may not adequately reflect the effects of\nexpected early exercise. It also does not allow for the possibility that expected volatility and other model\ninputs might vary over the option\u2019s life. However, for share options with relatively short contractual lives,\nor that must be exercised within a short period of time after vesting date, the factors identified above may\nnot apply. In these instances, the Black-Scholes-Merton formula may produce a value that is substantially\nthe same as a more flexible option pricing model.  \nB6 All option pricing models take into account, as a minimum, the following factors:  \n(a) the exercise price of the option;  \n(b) the life of the option;  \n(c) the current price of the underlying shares;  \n(d) the expected volatility of the share price;  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE21-->(e) the dividends expected on the shares (if appropriate); and  \n(f) the risk-free interest rate for the life of the option.  \nB7 Other factors that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in setting the price shall also\nbe taken into account (except for vesting conditions and reload features that are excluded from the\nmeasurement of fair value in accordance with paragraphs 19\u201322).  \nB8 For example, a share option granted to an employee typically cannot be exercised during specified periods\n(eg during the vesting period or during periods specified by securities regulators). This factor shall be taken\ninto account if the option pricing model applied would otherwise assume that the option could be exercised\nat any time during its life. However, if an entity uses an option pricing model that values options that can be\nexercised only at the end of the options\u2019 life, no adjustment is required for the inability to exercise them\nduring the vesting period (or other periods during the options\u2019 life), because the model assumes that the\noptions cannot be exercised during those periods.  \nB9 Similarly, another factor common to employee share options is the possibility of early exercise of the\noption, for example, because the option is not freely transferable, or because the employee must exercise all\nvested options upon cessation of employment. The effects of expected early exercise shall be taken into\naccount, as discussed in paragraphs B16\u2013B21.  \nB10 Factors that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would not consider in setting the price of a share\noption (or other equity instrument) shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of share\noptions (or other equity instruments) granted. For example, for share options granted to employees, factors\nthat affect the value of the option from the individual employee\u2019s perspective only are not relevant to\nestimating the price that would be set by a knowledgeable, willing market participant.  \n**Inputs to option pricing models**  \nB11 In estimating the expected volatility of and dividends on the underlying shares, the objective is to\napproximate the expectations that would be reflected in a current market or negotiated exchange price for\nthe option. Similarly, when estimating the effects of early exercise of employee share options, the objective\nis to approximate the expectations that an outside party with access to detailed information about\nemployees\u2019 exercise behaviour would develop based on information available at the grant date.  \nB12 Often, there is likely to be a range of reasonable expectations about future volatility, dividends and exercise\nbehaviour. If so, an expected value should be calculated, by weighting each amount within the range by its\nassociated probability of occurrence.  \nB13 Expectations about the future are generally based on experience, modified if the future is reasonably\nexpected to differ from the past. In some circumstances, identifiable factors may indicate that unadjusted\nhistorical experience is a relatively poor predictor of future experience. For example, if an entity with two\ndistinctly different lines of business disposes of the one that was significantly less risky than the other,\nhistorical volatility may not be the best information on which to base reasonable expectations for the future.  \nB14 In other circumstances, historical information may not be available. For example, a newly listed entity will\nhave little, if any, historical data on the volatility of its share price. Unlisted and newly listed entities are\ndiscussed further below.  \nB15 In summary, an entity should not simply base estimates of volatility, exercise behaviour and dividends on\nhistorical information without considering the extent to which the past experience is expected to be\nreasonably predictive of future experience.  \n**Expected early exercise**  \nB16 Employees often exercise share options early, for a variety of reasons. For example, employee share options\nare typically non-transferable. This often causes employees to exercise their share options early, because\nthat is the only way for the employees to liquidate their position. Also, employees who cease employment\nare usually required to exercise any vested options within a short period of time, otherwise the share options\nare forfeited. This factor also causes the early exercise of employee share options. Other factors causing\nearly exercise are risk aversion and lack of wealth diversification.  \nB17 The means by which the effects of expected early exercise are taken into account depends upon the type of\noption pricing model applied. For example, expected early exercise could be taken into account by using an\nestimate of the option\u2019s expected life (which, for an employee share option, is the period of time from grant\ndate to the date on which the option is expected to be exercised) as an input into an option pricing model (eg\nthe Black-Scholes-Merton formula). Alternatively, expected early exercise could be modelled in a binomial\nor similar option pricing model that uses contractual life as an input.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE22-->B18 Factors to consider in estimating early exercise include:  \n(a) the length of the vesting period, because the share option typically cannot be exercised until the\nend of the vesting period. Hence, determining the valuation implications of expected early\nexercise is based on the assumption that the options will vest. The implications of vesting\nconditions are discussed in paragraphs 19\u201321.  \n(b) the average length of time similar options have remained outstanding in the past.  \n(c) the price of the underlying shares. Experience may indicate that the employees tend to exercise\noptions when the share price reaches a specified level above the exercise price.  \n(d) the employee\u2019s level within the organisation. For example, experience might indicate that higherlevel employees tend to exercise options later than lower-level employees (discussed further in\nparagraph B21).  \n(e) expected volatility of the underlying shares. On average, employees might tend to exercise\noptions on highly volatile shares earlier than on shares with low volatility.  \nB19 As noted in paragraph B17, the effects of early exercise could be taken into account by using an estimate of\nthe option\u2019s expected life as an input into an option pricing model. When estimating the expected life of\nshare options granted to a group of employees, the entity could base that estimate on an appropriately\nweighted average expected life for the entire employee group or on appropriately weighted average lives for\nsubgroups of employees within the group, based on more detailed data about employees\u2019 exercise behaviour\n(discussed further below).  \nB20 Separating an option grant into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour is\nlikely to be important. Option value is not a linear function of option term; value increases at a decreasing\nrate as the term lengthens. For example, if all other assumptions are equal, although a two-year option is\nworth more than a one-year option, it is not worth twice as much. That means that calculating estimated\noption value on the basis of a single weighted average life that includes widely differing individual lives\nwould overstate the total fair value of the share options granted. Separating options granted into several\ngroups, each of which has a relatively narrow range of lives included in its weighted average life, reduces\nthat overstatement.  \nB21 Similar considerations apply when using a binomial or similar model. For example, the experience of an\nentity that grants options broadly to all levels of employees might indicate that top-level executives tend to\nhold their options longer than middle-management employees hold theirs and that lower-level employees\ntend to exercise their options earlier than any other group. In addition, employees who are encouraged or\nrequired to hold a minimum amount of their employer\u2019s equity instruments, including options, might on\naverage exercise options later than employees not subject to that provision. In those situations, separating\noptions by groups of recipients with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour will result in a more\naccurate estimate of the total fair value of the share options granted.  \n**Expected volatility**  \nB22 Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The\nmeasure of volatility used in option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously\ncompounded rates of return on the share over a period of time. Volatility is typically expressed in\nannualised terms that are comparable regardless of the time period used in the calculation, for example,\ndaily, weekly or monthly price observations.  \nB23 The rate of return (which may be positive or negative) on a share for a period measures how much a\nshareholder has benefited from dividends and appreciation (or depreciation) of the share price.  \nB24 The expected annualised volatility of a share is the range within which the continuously compounded\nannual rate of return is expected to fall approximately two-thirds of the time. For example, to say that a\nshare with an expected continuously compounded rate of return of 12 per cent has a volatility of 30 per cent\nmeans that the probability that the rate of return on the share for one year will be between \u201318 per cent\n(12% \u2013 30%) and 42 per cent (12% + 30%) is approximately two-thirds. If the share price is CU100 at the\nbeginning of the year and no dividends are paid, the year-end share price would be expected to be between\nCU83.53 (CU100 \u00d7 e[\u20130.18]) and CU152.20 (CU100 \u00d7 e[0.42]) approximately two-thirds of the time.  \nB25 Factors to consider in estimating expected volatility include:  \n(a) implied volatility from traded share options on the entity\u2019s shares, or other traded instruments of\nthe entity that include option features (such as convertible debt), if any.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE23-->(b) the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally\ncommensurate with the expected term of the option (taking into account the remaining\ncontractual life of the option and the effects of expected early exercise).  \n(c) the length of time an entity\u2019s shares have been publicly traded. A newly listed entity might have a\nhigh historical volatility, compared with similar entities that have been listed longer. Further\nguidance for newly listed entities is given below.  \n(d) the tendency of volatility to revert to its mean, ie its long-term average level, and other factors\nindicating that expected future volatility might differ from past volatility. For example, if an\nentity\u2019s share price was extraordinarily volatile for some identifiable period of time because of a\nfailed takeover bid or a major restructuring, that period could be disregarded in computing\nhistorical average annual volatility.  \n(e) appropriate and regular intervals for price observations. The price observations should be\nconsistent from period to period. For example, an entity might use the closing price for each week\nor the highest price for the week, but it should not use the closing price for some weeks and the\nhighest price for other weeks. Also, the price observations should be expressed in the same\ncurrency as the exercise price.  \n_Newly listed entities_  \nB26 As noted in paragraph B25, an entity should consider historical volatility of the share price over the most\nrecent period that is generally commensurate with the expected option term. If a newly listed entity does not\nhave sufficient information on historical volatility, it should nevertheless compute historical volatility for\nthe longest period for which trading activity is available. It could also consider the historical volatility of\nsimilar entities following a comparable period in their lives. For example, an entity that has been listed for\nonly one year and grants options with an average expected life of five years might consider the pattern and\nlevel of historical volatility of entities in the same industry for the first six years in which the shares of those\nentities were publicly traded.  \n_Unlisted entities_  \nB27 An unlisted entity will not have historical information to consider when estimating expected volatility.\nSome factors to consider instead are set out below.  \nB28 In some cases, an unlisted entity that regularly issues options or shares to employees (or other parties) might\nhave set up an internal market for its shares. The volatility of those share prices could be considered when\nestimating expected volatility.  \nB29 Alternatively, the entity could consider the historical or implied volatility of similar listed entities, for which\nshare price or option price information is available, to use when estimating expected volatility. This would\nbe appropriate if the entity has based the value of its shares on the share prices of similar listed entities.  \nB30 If the entity has not based its estimate of the value of its shares on the share prices of similar listed entities,\nand has instead used another valuation methodology to value its shares, the entity could derive an estimate\nof expected volatility consistent with that valuation methodology. For example, the entity might value its\nshares on a net asset or earnings basis. It could consider the expected volatility of those net asset values or\nearnings.  \n**Expected dividends**  \nB31 Whether expected dividends should be taken into account when measuring the fair value of shares or\noptions granted depends on whether the counterparty is entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents.  \nB32 For example, if employees were granted options and are entitled to dividends on the underlying shares or\ndividend equivalents (which might be paid in cash or applied to reduce the exercise price) between grant\ndate and exercise date, the options granted should be valued as if no dividends will be paid on the\nunderlying shares, ie the input for expected dividends should be zero.  \nB33 Similarly, when the grant date fair value of shares granted to employees is estimated, no adjustment is\nrequired for expected dividends if the employee is entitled to receive dividends paid during the vesting\nperiod.  \nB34 Conversely, if the employees are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period\n(or before exercise, in the case of an option), the grant date valuation of the rights to shares or options\nshould take expected dividends into account. That is to say, when the fair value of an option grant is  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE24-->estimated, expected dividends should be included in the application of an option pricing model. When the\nfair value of a share grant is estimated, that valuation should be reduced by the present value of dividends\nexpected to be paid during the vesting period.  \nB35 Option pricing models generally call for expected dividend yield. However, the models may be modified to\nuse an expected dividend amount rather than a yield. An entity may use either its expected yield or its\nexpected payments. If the entity uses the latter, it should consider its historical pattern of increases in\ndividends. For example, if an entity\u2019s policy has generally been to increase dividends by approximately 3\nper cent per year, its estimated option value should not assume a fixed dividend amount throughout the\noption\u2019s life unless there is evidence that supports that assumption.  \nB36 Generally, the assumption about expected dividends should be based on publicly available information. An\nentity that does not pay dividends and has no plans to do so should assume an expected dividend yield of\nzero. However, an emerging entity with no history of paying dividends might expect to begin paying\ndividends during the expected lives of its employee share options. Those entities could use an average of\ntheir past dividend yield (zero) and the mean dividend yield of an appropriately comparable peer group.  \n**Risk-free interest rate**  \nB37 Typically, the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon government\nissues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed, with a remaining term equal to the\nexpected term of the option being valued (based on the option\u2019s remaining contractual life and taking into\naccount the effects of expected early exercise). It may be necessary to use an appropriate substitute, if no\nsuch government issues exist or circumstances indicate that the implied yield on zero-coupon government\nissues is not representative of the risk-free interest rate (for example, in high inflation economies). Also, an\nappropriate substitute should be used if market participants would typically determine the risk-free interest\nrate by using that substitute, rather than the implied yield of zero-coupon government issues, when\nestimating the fair value of an option with a life equal to the expected term of the option being valued.  \n**Capital structure effects**  \nB38 Typically, third parties, not the entity, write traded share options. When these share options are exercised,\nthe writer delivers shares to the option holder. Those shares are acquired from existing shareholders. Hence\nthe exercise of traded share options has no dilutive effect.  \nB39 In contrast, if share options are written by the entity, new shares are issued when those share options are\nexercised (either actually issued or issued in substance, if shares previously repurchased and held in treasury\nare used). Given that the shares will be issued at the exercise price rather than the current market price at the\ndate of exercise, this actual or potential dilution might reduce the share price, so that the option holder does\nnot make as large a gain on exercise as on exercising an otherwise similar traded option that does not dilute\nthe share price.  \nB40 Whether this has a significant effect on the value of the share options granted depends on various factors,\nsuch as the number of new shares that will be issued on exercise of the options compared with the number\nof shares already issued. Also, if the market already expects that the option grant will take place, the market\nmay have already factored the potential dilution into the share price at the date of grant.  \nB41 However, the entity should consider whether the possible dilutive effect of the future exercise of the share\noptions granted might have an impact on their estimated fair value at grant date. Option pricing models can\nbe adapted to take into account this potential dilutive effect.",

In addition, the entity\nshould recognise the effects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment\narrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee.  \nB43 To apply the requirements of paragraph 27:  \n(a) if the modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted (eg by reducing the\nexercise price), measured immediately before and after the modification, the entity shall include  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE25-->the incremental fair value granted in the measurement of the amount recognised for services\nreceived as consideration for the equity instruments granted. The incremental fair value granted is\nthe difference between the fair value of the modified equity instrument and that of the original\nequity instrument, both estimated as at the date of the modification. If the modification occurs\nduring the vesting period, the incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the\namount recognised for services received over the period from the modification date until the date\nwhen the modified equity instruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant date fair\nvalue of the original equity instruments, which is recognised over the remainder of the original\nvesting period. If the modification occurs after vesting date, the incremental fair value granted is\nrecognised immediately, or over the vesting period if the employee is required to complete an\nadditional period of service before becoming unconditionally entitled to those modified equity\ninstruments.  \n(b) similarly, if the modification increases the number of equity instruments granted, the entity shall\ninclude the fair value of the additional equity instruments granted, measured at the date of the\nmodification, in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received as consideration\nfor the equity instruments granted, consistently with the requirements in (a) above. For example,\nif the modification occurs during the vesting period, the fair value of the additional equity\ninstruments granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services\nreceived over the period from the modification date until the date when the additional equity\ninstruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant date fair value of the equity\ninstruments originally granted, which is recognised over the remainder of the original vesting\nperiod.  \n(c) if the entity modifies the vesting conditions in a manner that is beneficial to the employee, for\nexample, by reducing the vesting period or by modifying or eliminating a performance condition\n(other than a market condition, changes to which are accounted for in accordance with (a) above),\nthe entity shall take the modified vesting conditions into account when applying the requirements\nof paragraphs 19\u201321.  \nB44 Furthermore, if the entity modifies the terms or conditions of the equity instruments granted in a manner\nthat reduces the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is not otherwise beneficial to\nthe employee, the entity shall nevertheless continue to account for the services received as consideration for\nthe equity instruments granted as if that modification had not occurred (other than a cancellation of some or\nall the equity instruments granted, which shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph 28). For\nexample:  \n(a) if the modification reduces the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured\nimmediately before and after the modification, the entity shall not take into account that decrease\nin fair value and shall continue to measure the amount recognised for services received as\nconsideration for the equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the equity\ninstruments granted.  \n(b) if the modification reduces the number of equity instruments granted to an employee, that\nreduction shall be accounted for as a cancellation of that portion of the grant, in accordance with\nthe requirements of paragraph 28.  \n(c) if the entity modifies the vesting conditions in a manner that is not beneficial to the employee, for\nexample, by increasing the vesting period or by modifying or adding a performance condition\n(other than a market condition, changes to which are accounted for in accordance with (a) above),\nthe entity shall not take the modified vesting conditions into account when applying the\nrequirements of paragraphs 19\u201321.",

        "page_content=": "## Share-based payment transactions among group entities (2009 amendments)  \nB45 Paragraphs 43A\u201343C address the accounting for share-based payment transactions among group entities in\neach entity\u2019s separate or individual financial statements. Paragraphs B46\u2013B61 discuss how to apply the\nrequirements in paragraphs 43A\u201343C. As noted in paragraph 43D, share-based payment transactions among\ngroup entities may take place for a variety of reasons depending on facts and circumstances. Therefore, this\ndiscussion is not exhaustive and assumes that when the entity receiving the goods or services has no\nobligation to settle the transaction, the transaction is a parent\u2019s equity contribution to the subsidiary,\nregardless of any intragroup repayment arrangements.  \nB46 Although the discussion below focuses on transactions with employees, it also applies to similar sharebased payment transactions with suppliers of goods or services other than employees. An arrangement\nbetween a parent and its subsidiary may require the subsidiary to pay the parent for the provision of the\nequity instruments to the employees. The discussion below does not address how to account for such an\nintragroup payment arrangement.  \nB47 Four issues are commonly encountered in share-based payment transactions among group entities. For\nconvenience, the examples below discuss the issues in terms of a parent and its subsidiary.  \n**Share-based payment arrangements involving an entity\u2019s own equity**\n**instruments**  \nB48 The first issue is whether the following transactions involving an entity\u2019s own equity instruments should be\naccounted for as equity-settled or as cash-settled in accordance with the requirements of this Standard:  \n(a) an entity grants to its employees rights to equity instruments of the entity (eg share options), and\neither chooses or is required to buy equity instruments (ie treasury shares) from another party, to\nsatisfy its obligations to its employees; and  \n(b) an entity\u2019s employees are granted rights to equity instruments of the entity (eg share options),\neither by the entity itself or by its shareholders, and the shareholders of the entity provide the\nequity instruments needed.  \nB49 The entity shall account for share-based payment transactions in which it receives services as consideration\nfor its own equity instruments as equity-settled. This applies regardless of whether the entity chooses or is\nrequired to buy those equity instruments from another party to satisfy its obligations to its employees under\nthe share-based payment arrangement. It also applies regardless of whether:  \n(a) the employee\u2019s rights to the entity\u2019s equity instruments were granted by the entity itself or by its\nshareholder(s); or  \n(b) the share-based payment arrangement was settled by the entity itself or by its shareholder(s).  \nB50 If the shareholder has an obligation to settle the transaction with its investee\u2019s employees, it provides equity\ninstruments of its investee rather than its own. Therefore, if its investee is in the same group as the\nshareholder, in accordance with paragraph 43C, the shareholder shall measure its obligation in accordance\nwith the requirements applicable to cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the shareholder\u2019s\nseparate financial statements and those applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the\nshareholder\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE27-->**Share-based payment arrangements involving equity instruments of the**\n**parent**  \nB51 The second issue concerns share-based payment transactions between two or more entities within the same\ngroup involving an equity instrument of another group entity. For example, employees of a subsidiary are\ngranted rights to equity instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to the subsidiary.  \nB52 Therefore, the second issue concerns the following share-based payment arrangements:  \n(a) a parent grants rights to its equity instruments directly to the employees of its subsidiary: the\nparent (not the subsidiary) has the obligation to provide the employees of the subsidiary with the\nequity instruments; and  \n(b) a subsidiary grants rights to equity instruments of its parent to its employees: the subsidiary has\nthe obligation to provide its employees with the equity instruments.  \n_A parent grants rights to its equity instruments to the employees of its subsidiary_\n_(paragraph B52(a))_  \nB53 The subsidiary does not have an obligation to provide its parent\u2019s equity instruments to the subsidiary\u2019s\nemployees. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 43B, the subsidiary shall measure the services received\nfrom its employees in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment\ntransactions, and recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from the parent.  \nB54 The parent has an obligation to settle the transaction with the subsidiary\u2019s employees by providing the\nparent\u2019s own equity instruments. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 43C, the parent shall measure its\nobligation in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment\ntransactions.  \n_A subsidiary grants rights to equity instruments of its parent to its employees_\n_(paragraph B52(b))_  \nB55 Because the subsidiary does not meet either of the conditions in paragraph 43B, it shall account for the\ntransaction with its employees as cash-settled. This requirement applies irrespective of how the subsidiary\nobtains the equity instruments to satisfy its obligations to its employees.  \n**Share-based payment arrangements involving cash-settled payments to**\n**employees**  \nB56 The third issue is how an entity that receives goods or services from its suppliers (including employees)\nshould account for share-based arrangements that are cash-settled when the entity itself does not have any\nobligation to make the required payments to its suppliers. For example, consider the following arrangements\nin which the parent (not the entity itself) has an obligation to make the required cash payments to the\nemployees of the entity:  \n(a) the employees of the entity will receive cash payments that are linked to the price of its equity\ninstruments.  \n(b) the employees of the entity will receive cash payments that are linked to the price of its parent\u2019s\nequity instruments.  \nB57 The subsidiary does not have an obligation to settle the transaction with its employees. Therefore, the\nsubsidiary shall account for the transaction with its employees as equity-settled, and recognise a\ncorresponding increase in equity as a contribution from its parent. The subsidiary shall remeasure the cost\nof the transaction subsequently for any changes resulting from non-market vesting conditions not being met\nin accordance with paragraphs 19\u201321. This differs from the measurement of the transaction as cash-settled\nin the consolidated financial statements of the group.  \nB58 Because the parent has an obligation to settle the transaction with the employees, and the consideration is\ncash, the parent (and the consolidated group) shall measure its obligation in accordance with the\nrequirements applicable to cash-settled share-based payment transactions in paragraph 43C.  \n**Transfer of employees between group entities**  \nB59 The fourth issue relates to group share-based payment arrangements that involve employees of more than\none group entity. For example, a parent might grant rights to its equity instruments to the employees of its  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE28-->subsidiaries, conditional upon the completion of continuing service with the group for a specified period.\nAn employee of one subsidiary might transfer employment to another subsidiary during the specified\nvesting period without the employee\u2019s rights to equity instruments of the parent under the original sharebased payment arrangement being affected. If the subsidiaries have no obligation to settle the share-based\npayment transaction with their employees, they account for it as an equity-settled transaction. Each\nsubsidiary shall measure the services received from the employee by reference to the fair value of the equity\ninstruments at the date the rights to those equity instruments were originally granted by the parent as\ndefined in Appendix A, and the proportion of the vesting period the employee served with each subsidiary.  \nB60 If the subsidiary has an obligation to settle the transaction with its employees in its parent\u2019s equity\ninstruments, it accounts for the transaction as cash-settled. Each subsidiary shall measure the services\nreceived on the basis of grant date fair value of the equity instruments for the proportion of the vesting\nperiod the employee served with each subsidiary. In addition, each subsidiary shall recognise any change in\nthe fair value of the equity instruments during the employee\u2019s service period with each subsidiary.  \nB61 Such an employee, after transferring between group entities, may fail to satisfy a vesting condition other\nthan a market condition as defined in Appendix A, eg the employee leaves the group before completing the\nservice period. In this case, because the vesting condition is service to the group, each subsidiary shall\nadjust the amount previously recognised in respect of the services received from the employee in\naccordance with the principles in paragraph 19. Hence, if the rights to the equity instruments granted by the\nparent do not vest because of an employee\u2019s failure to meet a vesting condition other than a market\ncondition, no amount is recognised on a cumulative basis for the services received from that employee in\nthe financial statements of any group entity.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE29-->## Appendix C Australian simplified disclosures for Tier 2 entities  \n_This appendix is an integral part of the Standard._  \n**AusC1** **Paragraphs 44\u201352 do not apply to entities preparing general purpose financial statements**\n**that apply AASB 1060** **_General Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified Disclosures for_**\n**_For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities._**  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE30-->## Guidance on implementing AASB 2 Share-based Payment  \nCONTENTS  \n_from paragraph_  \n**DEFINITION OF GRANT DATE** **IG1**  \n**DEFINITION OF VESTING CONDITIONS** **IG4A**  \n**TRANSACTIONS WITH PARTIES OTHER THAN EMPLOYEES** **IG5**  \n**Transactions in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods**\n**or services received** **IG5A**  \n**Measurement date for transactions with parties other than employees** **IG6**  \n**TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS** **IG8**  \n**EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS** **IG9**  \n**CASH-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS** **IG18**  \n**SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH A NET SETTLEMENT FEATURE**\n**FOR WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATIONS** **IG19A**  \n**ACCOUNTING FOR A MODIFICATION OF A SHARE-BASED PAYMENT**\n**TRANSACTION THAT CHANGES ITS CLASSIFICATION FROM CASH-SETTLED**\n**TO EQUITY-SETTLED** **IG19B**  \n**SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH CASH ALTERNATIVES** **IG20**  \n**SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS AMONG GROUP ENTITIES** **IG22A**  \n**ILLUSTRATIVE DISCLOSURES** **IG23**  \n**SUMMARY OF CONDITIONS FOR A COUNTERPARTY TO RECEIVE AN EQUITY**\n**INSTRUMENT GRANTED AND OF ACCOUNTING TREATMENTS** **IG24**  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE31-->## Guidance on implementing AASB 2 Share-based Payment  \n_This guidance accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 2._",

        "page_content=": "## Definition of grant date  \nIG1 AASB 2 defines grant date as the date at which the entity and the employee (or other party providing\nsimilar services) agree to a share-based payment arrangement, being when the entity and the counterparty\nhave a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. At grant date the entity confers\non the counterparty the right to cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity, provided the specified\nvesting conditions, if any, are met. If that agreement is subject to an approval process (for example, by\nshareholders), grant date is the date when that approval is obtained.  \nIG2 As noted above, grant date is when both parties agree to a share-based payment arrangement. The word\n\u2018agree\u2019 is used in its usual sense, which means that there must be both an offer and acceptance of that offer.\nHence, the date at which one party makes an offer to another party is not grant date. The date of grant is\nwhen that other party accepts the offer. In some instances, the counterparty explicitly agrees to the\narrangement, eg by signing a contract. In other instances, agreement might be implicit, eg for many sharebased payment arrangements with employees, the employees\u2019 agreement is evidenced by their commencing\nto render services.  \nIG3 Furthermore, for both parties to have agreed to the share-based payment arrangement, both parties must\nhave a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Therefore, if some of the terms\nand conditions of the arrangement are agreed on one date, with the remainder of the terms and conditions\nagreed on a later date, then grant date is on that later date, when all of the terms and conditions have been\nagreed. For example, if an entity agrees to issue share options to an employee, but the exercise price of the\noptions will be set by a compensation committee that meets in three months\u2019 time, grant date is when the\nexercise price is set by the compensation committee.  \nIG4 In some cases, grant date might occur after the employees to whom the equity instruments were granted\nhave begun rendering services. For example, if a grant of equity instruments is subject to shareholder\napproval, grant date might occur some months after the employees have begun rendering services in respect\nof that grant. The Standard requires the entity to recognise the services when received. In this situation, the\nentity should estimate the grant date fair value of the equity instruments (eg by estimating the fair value of\nthe equity instruments at the end of the reporting period), for the purposes of recognising the services\nreceived during the period between service commencement date and grant date. Once the date of grant has\nbeen established, the entity should revise the earlier estimate so that the amounts recognised for services\nreceived in respect of the grant are ultimately based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments.",

        "page_content=": "## Transaction in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received  \nIG5A In some cases, however, it might be difficult to demonstrate that goods or services have been (or will be)\nreceived. For example, an entity may grant shares to a charitable organisation for nil consideration. It is\nusually not possible to identify the specific goods or services received in return for such a transaction. A\nsimilar situation might arise in transactions with other parties.  \nIG5B Paragraph 11 of AASB 2 requires transactions in which share-based payments are made to employees to be\nmeasured by reference to the fair value of the share-based payments at grant date.[8] Hence, the entity is not\nrequired to measure directly the fair value of the employee services received.  \nIG5C It should be noted that the phrase \u2018the fair value of the share-based payment\u2019 refers to the fair value of the\nparticular share-based payment concerned. For example, an entity might be required by government\nlegislation to issue some portion of its shares to nationals of a particular country that may be transferred\nonly to other nationals of that country. Such a transfer restriction may affect the fair value of the shares\nconcerned, and therefore those shares may have a fair value that is less than the fair value of otherwise\nidentical shares that do not carry such restrictions. In this situation, the phrase \u2018the fair value of the sharebased payment\u2019 would refer to the fair value of the restricted shares, not the fair value of other, unrestricted\nshares.  \nIG5D Paragraph 13A of AASB 2 specifies how such transactions should be measured. The following example\nillustrates how the entity should apply the requirements of the Standard to a transaction in which the entity\ncannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received.  \n8 In AASB 2, all references to employees include others providing similar services.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE33-->**IG Example 1**  \n_Share-based payment transaction in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods_\n_or services received_  \n**Background**  \nAn entity granted shares with a total fair value of CU100,000[(a)] to parties other than employees who are\nfrom a particular section of the community (historically disadvantaged individuals), as a means of\nenhancing its image as a good corporate citizen. The economic benefits derived from enhancing its\ncorporate image could take a variety of forms, such as increasing its customer base, attracting or\nretaining employees, or improving or maintaining its ability to tender successfully for business contracts.  \nThe entity cannot identify the specific consideration received. For example, no cash was received and no\nservice conditions were imposed. Therefore, the identifiable consideration (nil) is less than the fair value\nof the equity instruments granted (CU100,000).  \n**Application of requirements**  \nAlthough the entity cannot identify the specific goods or services received, the circumstances indicate\nthat goods or services have been (or will be) received, and therefore AASB 2 applies.  \nIn this situation, because the entity cannot identify the specific goods or services received, the rebuttable\npresumption in paragraph 13 of AASB 2, that the fair value of the goods or services received can be\nestimated reliably, does not apply. The entity should instead measure the goods or services received by\nreference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.  \n(a) In this example, and in all other examples in this guidance, monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units\n(CU)\u2019.",

This accounting method is known as the\nmodified grant date method, because the number of equity instruments included in the determination of the\ntransaction amount is adjusted to reflect the outcome of the vesting conditions, but no adjustment is made to\nthe fair value of those equity instruments. That fair value is estimated at grant date (for transactions with\nemployees and others providing similar services) and not subsequently revised. Hence, neither increases nor\ndecreases in the fair value of the equity instruments after grant date are taken into account when\ndetermining the transaction amount (other than in the context of measuring the incremental fair value\ntransferred if a grant of equity instruments is subsequently modified).  \nIG10 To apply these requirements, paragraph 20 of AASB 2 requires the entity to recognise the goods or services\nreceived during the vesting period based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments\nexpected to vest and to revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the\nnumber of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On vesting date, the entity\nrevises the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested (subject to the\nrequirements of paragraph 21 concerning market conditions).  \nIG11 In the examples below, the share options granted all vest at the same time, at the end of a specified period.\nIn some situations, share options or other equity instruments granted might vest in instalments over the\nvesting period. For example, suppose an employee is granted 100 share options, which will vest in\ninstalments of 25 share options at the end of each year over the next four years. To apply the requirements\nof the Standard, the entity should treat each instalment as a separate share option grant, because each\ninstalment has a different vesting period, and hence the fair value of each instalment will differ (because the\nlength of the vesting period affects, for example, the likely timing of cash flows arising from the exercise of\nthe options).  \n**IG Example 1A**  \n**Background**  \nAn entity grants 100 share options to each of its 500 employees. Each grant is conditional upon the\nemployee working for the entity over the next three years. The entity estimates that the fair value of each\nshare option is CU15.  \nOn the basis of a weighted average probability, the entity estimates that 20 per cent of employees will\nleave during the three-year period and therefore forfeit their rights to the share options.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nScenario 1  \nIf everything turns out exactly as expected, the entity recognises the following amounts during the\nvesting period, for services received as consideration for the share options.  \nYear Calculation Remuneration  \nexpense for period  \nCumulative  \nremuneration  \nexpense  \nCU CU  \n1 50,000 options \u00d7 80% \u00d7 CU15 \u00d7\n1/3 years 200,000 200,000  \n2 (50,000 options \u00d7 80% \u00d7 CU15 \u00d7\n2/3 years) \u2013 CU200,000 200,000 400,000  \n3 (50,000 options \u00d7 80% \u00d7 CU15 \u00d7\n3/3 years) \u2013 CU400,000 200,000 600,000  \nScenario 2  \nDuring year 1, 20 employees leave.

The entity revises its estimate of total employee departures over the threeyear period from 15 per cent to 12 per cent (60 employees). During year 3, a further 15 employees leave.\nHence, a total of 57 employees forfeited their rights to the share options during the three-year period, and\na total of 44,300 share options (443 employees \u00d7 100 options per employee) vested at the end of year 3.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE35-->**IG Example 1A**  \nYear Calculation Remuneration  \nexpense for period  \nCumulative  \nremuneration  \nexpense  \nCU CU  \n1 50,000 options \u00d7 85% \u00d7 CU15 \u00d7 [1]/3 years 212,500 212,500  \n2 (50,000 options \u00d7 88% \u00d7 CU15 \u00d7 [2]/3 years) \u2013\nCU212,500 227,500 440,000  \n3 (44,300 options \u00d7 CU15) \u2013 CU440,000 224,500 664,500  \nIG12 In Example 1A, the share options were granted conditionally upon the employees\u2019 completing a specified\nservice period. In some cases, a share option or share grant might also be conditional upon the achievement\nof a specified performance target. Examples 2, 3 and 4 illustrate the application of the Standard to share\noption or share grants with performance conditions (other than market conditions, which are discussed in\nparagraph IG13 and illustrated in Examples 5 and 6). In Example 2, the length of the vesting period varies,\ndepending on when the performance condition is satisfied. Paragraph 15 of the Standard requires the entity\nto estimate the length of the expected vesting period, based on the most likely outcome of the performance\ncondition, and to revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the length of the\nvesting period is likely to differ from previous estimates.  \n**IG Example 2**  \n_Grant with a performance condition, in which the length of the vesting period varies_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, the entity grants 100 shares each to 500 employees, conditional upon the\nemployees\u2019 remaining in the entity\u2019s employ during the vesting period. The shares will vest at the end\nof year 1 if the entity\u2019s earnings increase by more than 18 per cent; at the end of year 2 if the entity\u2019s\nearnings increase by more than an average of 13 per cent per year over the two-year period; and at the\nend of year 3 if the entity\u2019s earnings increase by more than an average of 10 per cent per year over the\nthree-year period. The shares have a fair value of CU30 per share at the start of year 1, which equals\nthe share price at grant date. No dividends are expected to be paid over the three-year period.  \nBy the end of year 1, the entity\u2019s earnings have increased by 14 per cent, and 30 employees have left.\nThe entity expects that earnings will continue to increase at a similar rate in year 2, and therefore\nexpects that the shares will vest at the end of year 2. The entity expects, on the basis of a weighted\naverage probability, that a further 30 employees will leave during year 2, and therefore expects that\n440 employees will vest in 100 shares each at the end of year 2.  \nBy the end of year 2, the entity\u2019s earnings have increased by only 10 per cent and therefore the shares\ndo not vest at the end of year 2. 28 employees have left during the year. The entity expects that a\nfurther 25 employees will leave during year 3, and that the entity\u2019s earnings will increase by at least 6\nper cent, thereby achieving the average of 10 per cent per year.  \nBy the end of year 3, 23 employees have left and the entity\u2019s earnings had increased by 8 per cent,\nresulting in an average increase of 10.67 per cent per year.

If the volume of sales of the product increases by an average of between 5\nper cent and 10 per cent per year, each employee will receive 100 share options. If the volume of sales\nincreases by an average of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent each year, each employee will receive\n200 share options. If the volume of sales increases by an average of 15 per cent or more, each employee\nwill receive 300 share options.  \nOn grant date, Entity A estimates that the share options have a fair value of CU20 per option. Entity A\nalso estimates that the volume of sales of the product will increase by an average of between 10 per cent\nand 15 per cent per year, and therefore expects that, for each employee who remains in service until the\nend of year 3, 200 share options will vest. The entity also estimates, on the basis of a weighted average\nprobability, that 20 per cent of employees will leave before the end of year 3.  \nBy the end of year 1, seven employees have left and the entity still expects that a total of 20 employees\nwill leave by the end of year 3.

The exercise price is CU40.\nHowever, the exercise price drops to CU30 if the entity\u2019s earnings increase by at least an average of 10\nper cent per year over the three-year period.  \nOn grant date, the entity estimates that the fair value of the share options, with an exercise price of CU30,\nis CU16 per option. If the exercise price is CU40, the entity estimates that the share options have a fair\nvalue of CU12 per option.  \nDuring year 1, the entity\u2019s earnings increased by 12 per cent, and the entity expects that earnings will\ncontinue to increase at this rate over the next two years. The entity therefore expects that the earnings\ntarget will be achieved, and hence the share options will have an exercise price of CU30.  \nDuring year 2, the entity\u2019s earnings increased by 13 per cent, and the entity continues to expect that the\nearnings target will be achieved.  \nDuring year 3, the entity\u2019s earnings increased by only 3 per cent, and therefore the earnings target was\nnot achieved.

Instead, the entity estimates the fair value of\nthe share options at grant date under each scenario (ie exercise price of CU40 and exercise price of\nCU30) and ultimately revises the transaction amount to reflect the outcome of that performance\ncondition, as illustrated below.  \nYear Calculation Remuneration  \nexpense for period  \nCumulative  \nremuneration  \nexpense  \nCU CU  \n1 10,000 options \u00d7 CU16 \u00d7 [1]/3 53,333 53,333  \n2 (10,000 options \u00d7 CU16 \u00d7 [2]/3) \u2013\nCU53,333 53,334 106,667  \n3 (10,000 options \u00d7 CU12 \u00d7 [3]/3) \u2013\nCU106,667 13,333 120,000  \nIG13 Paragraph 21 of the Standard requires market conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or\nexercisability) is conditional, to be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity\ninstruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with market conditions, the entity\nrecognises the goods or services received from a counterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (eg\nservices received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective\nof whether that market condition is satisfied. Example 5 illustrates these requirements.  \n**IG Example 5**  \n_Grant with a market condition_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants to a senior executive 10,000 share options, conditional upon\nthe executive remaining in the entity\u2019s employ until the end of year 3. However, the share options cannot\nbe exercised unless the share price has increased from CU50 at the beginning of year 1 to above CU65 at  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE38-->**IG Example 5**  \nthe end of year 3. If the share price is above CU65 at the end of year 3, the share options can be exercised\nat any time during the next seven years, ie by the end of year 10.  \nThe entity applies a binomial option pricing model, which takes into account the possibility that the share\nprice will exceed CU65 at the end of year 3 (and hence the share options become exercisable) and the\npossibility that the share price will not exceed CU65 at the end of year 3 (and hence the options will be\nforfeited). It estimates the fair value of the share options with this market condition to be CU24 per\noption.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nBecause paragraph 21 of the Standard requires the entity to recognise the services received from a\ncounterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (eg services received from an employee who\nremains in service for the specified service period), irrespective of whether that market condition is\nsatisfied, it makes no difference whether the share price target is achieved. The possibility that the share\nprice target might not be achieved has already been taken into account when estimating the fair value of\nthe share options at grant date. Therefore, if the entity expects the executive to complete the three-year\nservice period, and the executive does so, the entity recognises the following amounts in years 1, 2 and 3:  \nYear Calculation Remuneration  \nexpense for period  \nCumulative  \nremuneration  \nexpense  \nCU CU  \n1 10,000 options \u00d7 CU24 \u00d7 [1]/3 80,000 80,000  \n2 (10,000 options \u00d7 CU24 \u00d7 [2]/3) \u2013 CU80,000 80,000 160,000  \n3 (10,000 options \u00d7 CU24) \u2013 CU160,000 80,000 240,000  \nAs noted above, these amounts are recognised irrespective of the outcome of the market condition.\nHowever, if the executive left during year 2 (or year 3), the amount recognised during year 1 (and year 2)\nwould be reversed in year 2 (or year 3). This is because the service condition, in contrast to the market\ncondition, was not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the share options at grant date.\nInstead, the service condition is taken into account by adjusting the transaction amount to be based on the\nnumber of equity instruments that ultimately vest, in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 20 of the\nStandard.  \nIG14 In Example 5, the outcome of the market condition did not change the length of the vesting period.\nHowever, if the length of the vesting period varies depending on when a performance condition is satisfied,\nparagraph 15 of the Standard requires the entity to presume that the services to be rendered by the\nemployees as consideration for the equity instruments granted will be received in the future, over the\nexpected vesting period. The entity is required to estimate the length of the expected vesting period at grant\ndate, based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition. If the performance condition is a\nmarket condition, the estimate of the length of the expected vesting period must be consistent with the\nassumptions used in estimating the fair value of the share options granted, and is not subsequently revised.\nExample 6 illustrates these requirements.  \n**IG Example 6**  \n_Grant with a market condition, in which the length of the vesting period varies_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants 10,000 share options with a ten-year life to each of ten senior\nexecutives. The share options will vest and become exercisable immediately if and when the entity\u2019s\nshare price increases from CU50 to CU70, provided that the executive remains in service until the share\nprice target is achieved.  \nThe entity applies a binomial option pricing model, which takes into account the possibility that the share\nprice target will be achieved during the ten-year life of the options, and the possibility that the target will\nnot be achieved. The entity estimates that the fair value of the share options at grant date is CU25 per\noption. From the option pricing model, the entity determines that the mode of the distribution of possible  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE39-->**IG Example 6**  \nvesting dates is five years. In other words, of all the possible outcomes, the most likely outcome of the\nmarket condition is that the share price target will be achieved at the end of year 5. Therefore, the entity\nestimates that the expected vesting period is five years. The entity also estimates that two executives will\nhave left by the end of year 5, and therefore expects that 80,000 share options (10,000 share options \u00d7 8\nexecutives) will vest at the end of year 5.  \nThroughout years 1\u20134, the entity continues to estimate that a total of two executives will leave by the end\nof year 5. However, in total three executives leave, one in each of years 3, 4 and 5. The share price target\nis achieved at the end of year 6. Another executive leaves during year 6, before the share price target is\nachieved.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nParagraph 15 of the Standard requires the entity to recognise the services received over the expected\nvesting period, as estimated at grant date, and also requires the entity not to revise that estimate.\nTherefore, the entity recognises the services received from the executives over years 1\u20135. Hence, the\ntransaction amount is ultimately based on 70,000 share options (10,000 share options \u00d7 7 executives who\nremain in service at the end of year 5).  \nAlthough another executive left during year 6, no adjustment is made, because the executive had already\ncompleted the expected vesting period of five years.

Examples\n7\u20139 illustrate some of these requirements.  \n**IG Example 7**  \n_Grant of share options that are subsequently repriced_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants 100 share options to each of its 500 employees. Each grant is\nconditional upon the employee remaining in service over the next three years. The entity estimates that\nthe fair value of each option is CU15. On the basis of a weighted average probability, the entity estimates\nthat 100 employees will leave during the three-year period and therefore forfeit their rights to the share\noptions.  \nSuppose that 40 employees leave during year 1. Also suppose that by the end of year 1, the entity\u2019s share\nprice has dropped, and the entity reprices its share options, and that the repriced share options vest at the\nend of year 3. The entity estimates that a further 70 employees will leave during years 2 and 3, and hence\nthe total expected employee departures over the three-year vesting period is 110 employees. During year\n2, a further 35 employees leave, and the entity estimates that a further 30 employees will leave during\nyear 3, to bring the total expected employee departures over the three-year vesting period to 105\nemployees. During year 3, a total of 28 employees leave, and hence a total of 103 employees ceased\nemployment during the vesting period. For the remaining 397 employees, the share options vested at the\nend of year 3.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE40-->**IG Example 7**  \nThe entity estimates that, at the date of repricing, the fair value of each of the original share options\ngranted (ie before taking into account the repricing) is CU5 and that the fair value of each repriced share\noption is CU8.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nParagraph 27 of the Standard requires the entity to recognise the effects of modifications that increase the\ntotal fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee. If\nthe modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted (eg by reducing the exercise\nprice), measured immediately before and after the modification, paragraph B43(a) of Appendix B\nrequires the entity to include the incremental fair value granted (ie the difference between the fair value\nof the modified equity instrument and that of the original equity instrument, both estimated as at the date\nof the modification) in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received as consideration\nfor the equity instruments granted. If the modification occurs during the vesting period, the incremental\nfair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the\nperiod from the modification date until the date when the modified equity instruments vest, in addition to\nthe amount based on the grant date fair value of the original equity instruments, which is recognised over\nthe remainder of the original vesting period.  \nThe incremental value is CU3 per share option (CU8 \u2013 CU5). This amount is recognised over the\nremaining two years of the vesting period, along with remuneration expense based on the original option\nvalue of CU15.  \nThe amounts recognised in years 1\u20133 are as follows:  \nYear Calculation Remuneration  \nexpense for period  \nCumulative  \nremuneration  \nexpense  \nCU CU  \n1 (500 \u2013 110) employees \u00d7 100 options \u00d7\nCU15 \u00d7 [1]/3 195,000 195,000  \n2 (500 \u2013 105) employees \u00d7 100 options \u00d7\n(CU15 \u00d7 [2]/3 + CU3 \u00d7 [1]/2) \u2013 CU195,000 259,250 454,250  \n3 (500 \u2013 103) employees \u00d7 100 options \u00d7\n(CU15 + CU3) \u2013 CU454,250 260,350 714,600  \n**IG Example 8**  \n_Grant of share options with a vesting condition that is subsequently modified_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, the entity grants 1,000 share options to each member of its sales team,\nconditional upon the employee remaining in the entity\u2019s employ for three years, and the team selling\nmore than 50,000 units of a particular product over the three-year period. The fair value of the share\noptions is CU15 per option at the date of grant.  \nDuring year 2, the entity increases the sales target to 100,000 units. By the end of year 3, the entity has\nsold 55,000 units, and the share options are forfeited. Twelve members of the sales team have remained\nin service for the three-year period.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nParagraph 20 of the Standard requires, for a performance condition that is not a market condition, the\nentity to recognise the services received during the vesting period based on the best available estimate of\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest and to revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent\ninformation indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous\nestimates. On vesting date, the entity revises the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that\nultimately vested. However, paragraph 27 of the Standard requires, irrespective of any modifications to\nthe terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted, or a cancellation or settlement of\nthat grant of equity instruments, the entity to recognise, as a minimum, the services received, measured at  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE41-->**IG Example 8**  \nthe grant date fair value of the equity instruments granted, unless those equity instruments do not vest\nbecause of failure to satisfy a vesting condition (other than a market condition) that was specified at grant\ndate. Furthermore, paragraph B44(c) of Appendix B specifies that, if the entity modifies the vesting\nconditions in a manner that is not beneficial to the employee, the entity does not take the modified\nvesting conditions into account when applying the requirements of paragraphs 19\u201321 of the Standard.  \nTherefore, because the modification to the performance condition made it less likely that the share\noptions will vest, which was not beneficial to the employee, the entity takes no account of the modified\nperformance condition when recognising the services received. Instead, it continues to recognise the\nservices received over the three-year period based on the original vesting conditions. Hence, the entity\nultimately recognises cumulative remuneration expense of CU180,000 over the three-year period (12\nemployees \u00d7 1,000 options \u00d7 CU15).  \nThe same result would have occurred if, instead of modifying the performance target, the entity had\nincreased the number of years of service required for the share options to vest from three years to ten\nyears. Because such a modification would make it less likely that the options will vest, which would not\nbe beneficial to the employees, the entity would take no account of the modified service condition when\nrecognising the services received. Instead, it would recognise the services received from the twelve\nemployees who remained in service over the original three-year vesting period.  \n**IG Example 9**  \n_Grant of shares, with a cash alternative subsequently added_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, the entity grants 10,000 shares with a fair value of CU33 per share to a senior\nexecutive, conditional upon the completion of three years\u2019 service. By the end of year 2, the share price\nhas dropped to CU25 per share. At that date, the entity adds a cash alternative to the grant, whereby the\nexecutive can choose whether to receive 10,000 shares or cash equal to the value of 10,000 shares on\nvesting date. The share price is CU22 on vesting date.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nParagraph 27 of the Standard requires, irrespective of any modifications to the terms and conditions on\nwhich the equity instruments were granted, or a cancellation or settlement of that grant of equity\ninstruments, the entity to recognise, as a minimum, the services received measured at the grant date fair\nvalue of the equity instruments granted, unless those equity instruments do not vest because of failure to\nsatisfy a vesting condition (other than a market condition) that was specified at grant date. Therefore, the\nentity recognises the services received over the three-year period, based on the grant date fair value of the\nshares.  \nFurthermore, the addition of the cash alternative at the end of year 2 creates an obligation to settle in\ncash. In accordance with the requirements for cash-settled share-based payment transactions (paragraphs\n30\u201333 of the Standard), the entity recognises the liability to settle in cash at the modification date, based\non the fair value of the shares at the modification date and the extent to which the specified services have\nbeen received. Furthermore, the entity remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each\nreporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss\nfor the period. Therefore, the entity recognises the following amounts:  \nYear Calculation Expense Equity Liability  \nCU CU CU  \n1 Remuneration expense for year:\n10,000 shares \u00d7 CU33 \u00d7 [1]/3 110,000 110,000  \n2 Remuneration expense for year:\n(10,000 shares \u00d7 CU33 \u00d7 [2]/3) \u2013\nCU110,000 110,000 110,000  \nReclassify equity to liabilities:\n10,000 shares \u00d7 CU25 \u00d7 [2]/3 (166,667) 166,667  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE42-->**IG Example 9**  \n3 Remuneration expense for year:\n(10,000 shares \u00d7 CU33 \u00d7 [3]/3) \u2013\nCU220,000 110,000[(a)] 26,667 83,333  \nAdjust liability to closing fair value:\n(CU166,667 + CU83,333) \u2013\n(CU22 \u00d7 10,000 shares) (30,000) (30,000)  \nTotal 300,000 80,000 220,000  \n(a) Allocated between liabilities and equity, to bring in the final third of the liability based on the fair value of the\nshares as at the date of the modification.  \nIG15A If a share-based payment has a non-vesting condition that the counterparty can choose not to meet and the\ncounterparty does not meet that non-vesting condition during the vesting period, paragraph 28A of the\nStandard requires that event to be treated as a cancellation. Example 9A illustrates the accounting for this\ntype of event.  \n**IG Example 9A**  \n_Share-based payment with vesting and non-vesting conditions when the counterparty can choose_\n_whether the non-vesting condition is met_  \n**Background**  \nAn entity grants an employee the opportunity to participate in a plan in which the employee obtains\nshare options if he agrees to save 25 per cent of his monthly salary of CU400 for a three-year period.\nThe monthly payments are made by deduction from the employee\u2019s salary. The employee may use the\naccumulated savings to exercise his options at the end of three years, or take a refund of his\ncontributions at any point during the three-year period. The estimated annual expense for the share-based\npayment arrangement is CU120.  \nAfter 18 months, the employee stops paying contributions to the plan and takes a refund of contributions\npaid to date of CU1,800.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nThere are three components to this plan: paid salary, salary deduction paid to the savings plan and sharebased payment. The entity recognises an expense in respect of each component and a corresponding\nincrease in liability or equity as appropriate. The requirement to pay contributions to the plan is a nonvesting condition, which the employee chooses not to meet in the second year. Therefore, in accordance\nwith paragraphs 28(b) and 28A of the Standard, the repayment of contributions is treated as an\nextinguishment of the liability and the cessation of contributions in year 2 is treated as a cancellation.  \nYEAR 1 Expense Cash Liability Equity  \nCU CU CU CU  \nPaid salary 3,600  \n(75% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 12) (3,600)  \nSalary deduction paid\nto the savings plan  \n1,200  \n(25% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 12) (1,200)  \nShare-based payment 120 (120)  \nTotal 4,920 (3,600) (1,200) (120)  \nYEAR 2  \nPaid salary 4,200  \n(75% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 6  \n+ 100% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 6) (4,200)  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE43-->**IG Example 9A**  \nSalary deduction paid\nto the savings plan  \n600  \n(25% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 6) (600)  \nRefund of contributions\nto the employee (1,800) 1,800  \nShare-based payment  \n(acceleration of 240\nremaining expense) (120 \u00d7 3 \u2013 120) (240)  \nTotal 5,040 (6,000) 1,200 (240)  \nIG16 Paragraph 24 of the Standard requires that, in rare cases only, in which the Standard requires the entity to\nmeasure an equity-settled share-based payment transaction by reference to the fair value of the equity\ninstruments granted, but the entity is unable to estimate reliably that fair value at the specified measurement\ndate (eg grant date, for transactions with employees), the entity shall instead measure the transaction using\nan intrinsic value measurement method. Paragraph 24 also contains requirements on how to apply this\nmethod. The following example illustrates these requirements.  \n**IG Example 10**  \n_Grant of share options that is accounted for by applying the intrinsic value method_  \n**Background**  \nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants 1,000 share options to 50 employees. The share options will\nvest at the end of year 3, provided the employees remain in service until then. The share options have a\nlife of 10 years. The exercise price is CU60 and the entity\u2019s share price is also CU60 at the date of grant.  \nAt the date of grant, the entity concludes that it cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the share options\ngranted.  \nAt the end of year 1, three employees have ceased employment and the entity estimates that a further\nseven employees will leave during years 2 and 3. Hence, the entity estimates that 80 per cent of the share\noptions will vest.  \nTwo employees leave during year 2, and the entity revises its estimate of the number of share options that\nit expects will vest to 86 per cent.  \nTwo employees leave during year 3. Hence, 43,000 share options vested at the end of year 3.  \nThe entity\u2019s share price during years 1\u201310, and the number of share options exercised during years 4\u201310,\nare set out below.

The following example illustrates\nthe application of AASB 2 to one particular type of plan\u2014an employee share purchase plan. Typically, an\nemployee share purchase plan provides employees with the opportunity to purchase the entity\u2019s shares at a\ndiscounted price. The terms and conditions under which employee share purchase plans operate differ from\ncountry to country. That is to say, not only are there many different types of employee share and share\noptions plans, there are also many different types of employee share purchase plans. Therefore, the\nfollowing example illustrates the application of AASB 2 to one specific employee share purchase plan.  \n**IG Example 11**  \n_Employee share purchase plan_  \n**Background**  \nAn entity offers all its 1,000 employees the opportunity to participate in an employee share purchase\nplan. The employees have two weeks to decide whether to accept the offer. Under the terms of the plan,\nthe employees are entitled to purchase a maximum of 100 shares each. The purchase price will be 20 per\ncent less than the market price of the entity\u2019s shares at the date the offer is accepted, and the purchase\nprice must be paid immediately upon acceptance of the offer. All shares purchased must be held in trust\nfor the employees, and cannot be sold for five years. The employee is not permitted to withdraw from the\nplan during that period. For example, if the employee ceases employment during the five-year period, the\nshares must nevertheless remain in the plan until the end of the five-year period. Any dividends paid\nduring the five-year period will be held in trust for the employees until the end of the five-year period.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE45-->**IG Example 11**  \nIn total, 800 employees accept the offer and each employee purchases, on average, 80 shares, ie the\nemployees purchase a total of 64,000 shares. The weighted-average market price of the shares at the\npurchase date is CU30 per share, and the weighted-average purchase price is CU24 per share.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nFor transactions with employees, AASB 2 requires the transaction amount to be measured by reference\nto the fair value of the equity instruments granted (AASB 2, paragraph 11). To apply this requirement, it\nis necessary first to determine the type of equity instrument granted to the employees. Although the plan\nis described as an employee share purchase plan (ESPP), some ESPPs include option features and are\ntherefore, in effect, share option plans. For example, an ESPP might include a \u2018look-back feature\u2019,\nwhereby the employee is able to purchase shares at a discount, and choose whether the discount is\napplied to the entity\u2019s share price at the date of grant or its share price at the date of purchase. Or an\nESPP might specify the purchase price, and then allow the employees a significant period of time to\ndecide whether to participate in the plan. Another example of an option feature is an ESPP that permits\nthe participating employees to cancel their participation before or at the end of a specified period and\nobtain a refund of amounts previously paid into the plan.  \nHowever, in this example, the plan includes no option features. The discount is applied to the share price\nat the purchase date, and the employees are not permitted to withdraw from the plan.  \nAnother factor to consider is the effect of post-vesting transfer restrictions, if any. Paragraph B3 of\nAASB 2 states that, if shares are subject to restrictions on transfer after vesting date, that factor should be\ntaken into account when estimating the fair value of those shares, but only to the extent that the postvesting restrictions affect the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for that\nshare. For example, if the shares are actively traded in a deep and liquid market, post-vesting transfer\nrestrictions may have little, if any, effect on the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant\nwould pay for those shares.  \nIn this example, the shares are vested when purchased, but cannot be sold for five years after the date of\npurchase. Therefore, the entity should consider the valuation effect of the five-year post-vesting transfer\nrestriction. This entails using a valuation technique to estimate what the price of the restricted share\nwould have been on the purchase date in an arm\u2019s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing\nparties. Suppose that, in this example, the entity estimates that the fair value of each restricted share is\nCU28. In this case, the fair value of the equity instruments granted is CU4 per share (being the fair value\nof the restricted share of CU28 less the purchase price of CU24). Because 64,000 shares were purchased,\nthe total fair value of the equity instruments granted is CU256,000.  \nIn this example, there is no vesting period. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 14 of AASB 2, the\nentity should recognise an expense of CU256,000 immediately.  \nHowever, in some cases, the expense relating to an ESPP might not be material. AASB 108 Accounting\n_Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors states that the accounting policies in Australian_\nAccounting Standards need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial (AASB 108,\nparagraph 8). AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements states that information is material if\nomitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary\nusers of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which\nprovide financial information about a specific reporting entity. Materiality depends on the nature or\nmagnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether information, either individually or in\ncombination with other information, is material in the context of its financial statements taken as a whole\n(AASB 101, paragraph 7). Therefore, in this example, the entity should consider whether the expense of\nCU256,000 is material.",

The entity is required to recognise initially the goods or\nservices acquired, and a liability to pay for those goods or services, when the entity obtains the goods or as\nthe services are rendered, measured at the fair value of the liability. Thereafter, until the liability is settled,\nthe entity is required to recognise changes in the fair value of the liability.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE46-->IG19 For example, an entity might grant share appreciation rights to employees as part of their remuneration\npackage, whereby the employees will become entitled to a future cash payment (rather than an equity\ninstrument), based on the increase in the entity\u2019s share price from a specified level over a specified period\nof time. If the share appreciation rights do not vest until the employees have completed a specified period of\nservice, the entity recognises the services received, and a liability to pay for them, as the employees render\nservice during that period. The liability is measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until\nsettled, at the fair value of the share appreciation rights in accordance with paragraphs 30\u201333D of AASB 2.\nChanges in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Therefore, if the amount recognised for the services\nreceived was included in the carrying amount of an asset recognised in the entity\u2019s statement of financial\nposition (for example, inventory), the carrying amount of that asset is not adjusted for the effects of the\nliability remeasurement. Example 12 illustrates these requirements for a cash-settled share-based payment\ntransaction that is subject to a service condition. Example 12A illustrates these requirements for a cashsettled share-based payment transaction that is subject to a performance condition.  \n**IG Example 12**  \n**Background**  \nAn entity grants 100 cash share appreciation rights (SARs) to each of its 500 employees, on condition that\nthe employees remain in its employ for the next three years.  \nDuring year 1, 35 employees leave.

The entity transfers that amount, normally in cash, to the tax authority on the\nemployee\u2019s behalf. Example 12B illustrates these requirements.  \n**IG Example 12B**  \n**Background**  \nThe tax law in jurisdiction X requires entities to withhold an amount for an employee\u2019s tax obligation\nassociated with a share-based payment and transfer that amount in cash to the tax authority on the\nemployee\u2019s behalf.  \nOn 1 January 20X1 an entity in jurisdiction X grants an award of 100 shares to an employee; that award is\nconditional upon the completion of four years\u2019 service. The entity expects that the employee will complete\nthe service period. For simplicity, this example assumes that none of the employee\u2019s compensation\nqualifies for capitalisation as part of the cost of an asset.  \nThe terms and conditions of the share-based payment arrangement require the entity to withhold shares\nfrom the settlement of the award to its employee in order to settle the employee\u2019s tax obligation (that is,\nthe share-based payment arrangement has a \u2018net settlement feature\u2019). Accordingly, the entity settles the\ntransaction on a net basis by withholding the number of shares with a fair value equal to the monetary\nvalue of the employee\u2019s tax obligation and issuing the remaining shares to the employee on completion of\nthe vesting period.  \nThe employee\u2019s tax obligation associated with the award is calculated based on the fair value of the shares\non the vesting date. The employee\u2019s applicable tax rate is 40 per cent.  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE49-->**IG Example 12B**  \nAt grant date, the fair value of each share is CU2. The fair value of each share at 31 December 20X4 is\nCU10.  \nThe fair value of the shares on the vesting date is CU1,000 (100 shares \u00d7 CU10 per share) and therefore\nthe employee\u2019s tax obligation is CU400 (100 shares \u00d7 CU10 \u00d7 40%). Accordingly, on the vesting date, the\nentity issues 60 shares to the employee and withholds 40 shares (CU400 = 40 shares \u00d7 CU10 per share).\nThe entity pays the fair value of the withheld shares in cash to the tax authority on the employee\u2019s behalf.\nIn other words, it is as if the entity had issued all 100 vested shares to the employee, and at the same time,\nrepurchased 40 shares at their fair value.  \n**Application of requirements**  \n**Dr.** **Cr.** **Cr.**  \n**Expense** **Equity** **Liability**  \n**Year** **Calculation** **CU** **CU** **CU**  \n1 100 shares \u00d7 CU2 \u00d7 [1]/4 50 (50) \u2013  \n2 100 shares \u00d7 CU2 \u00d7 [2]/4 \u2013 CU50 50 (50) \u2013  \n3 100 shares \u00d7 CU2 \u00d7 [3]/4 \u2013 (CU50 + CU50) 50 (50) \u2013  \n100 shares \u00d7 CU2 \u00d7 [4]/4 \u2013 (CU50 + CU50  \n4 + CU50) 50 (50) \u2013  \nTotal 200 (200) \u2013  \n**The journal entries recorded by the entity are as follows:**  \n_During the vesting period_  \nAccumulated compensation expense recognised over the vesting period  \nDr Expense 200  \nCr Equity 200  \n_Recognition of the tax liability[(a)]_  \nDr Equity 400  \nCr Liability 400  \n_Settlement of tax obligation_  \nCash paid to the tax authority on the employee\u2019s behalf at the date of settlement  \nDr Liability 400  \nCr Cash 400  \n(a) The entity considers disclosing an estimate of the amount that it expects to transfer to the tax authority at the end of\neach reporting period.

On 31 December 20X2 the estimated fair value of\neach SAR is CU12 and consequently, the total fair value of the cash-settled award is CU120,000.  \nOn 31 December 20X2 the entity cancels the SARs and, in their place, grants 100 share options to each\nemployee on the condition that each employee remains in its employ for the next two years. Therefore the\noriginal vesting period is not changed. On this date the fair value of each share option is CU13.20 and\nconsequently, the total fair value of the new grant is CU132,000. All of the employees are expected to and\nultimately do provide the required service.  \nFor simplicity, this example assumes that none of the employees\u2019 compensation qualifies for capitalisation\nas part of the cost of an asset.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nAt the modification date (31 December 20X2), the entity applies paragraph B44A. Accordingly:  \n(a) from the date of the modification, the share options are measured by reference to their\nmodification-date fair value and, at the modification date, the share options are recognised in\nequity to the extent to which the employees have rendered services;  \n(b) the liability for the SARs is derecognised at the modification date; and  \n(c) the difference between the carrying amount of the liability derecognised and the equity amount\nrecognised at the modification date is recognised immediately in profit or loss.  \nAt the modification date (31 December 20X2), the entity compares the fair value of the equity-settled\nreplacement award for services provided through to the modification date (CU132,000 \u00d7 2\u20444 = CU66,000)\nwith the fair value of the cash-settled original award for those services (CU120,000 \u00d7 2\u20444 = CU60,000).\nThe difference (CU6,000) is recognised immediately in profit or loss at the date of the modification.  \nThe remainder of the equity-settled share-based payment (measured at its modification-date fair value) is\nrecognised in profit or loss over the remaining two-year vesting period from the date of the modification.  \n**Dr.**  \n**Expense**  \n**Cumulative**  \n**expense**  \n**Cr.**  \n**Equity**  \n**Cr.**  \n**Liability**  \n**Year** **Calculation** **CU** **CU** **CU** **CU**  \n1 100 employees \u00d7100 SARs x\nCU10 \u00d7 [1]/4 25,000 \u2013 \u2013 25,000  \n2 _Remeasurement before the_\n_modification 100 employees x_\n100 SARs \u00d7 CU12.00 \u00d7 [2]/4 \u2013\n25,000 35,000 60,000 \u2013 35,000  \n_Derecognition of the liability,_\n_recognition of the modification-_\n_date fair value amount in equity_\n_and recognition of the effect of_\n_settlement for CU6,000 (100_\nemployees x 100 share options\n\u00d7 CU13.20 \u00d7 [2]/4) \u2013 (100\nemployees \u00d7 100 SARs \u00d7\nCU12.00 \u00d7 [2]/4) 6,000 66,000 66,000 (60,000)  \n3 100 employees \u00d7 100 share\noptions \u00d7 CU13.20 \u00d7 [3]/4 \u2013\nCU66,000 33,000 99,000 33,000 \u2013  \n4 100 employees x 100 share\noptions \u00d7 CU13.20 \u00d7 [4]/4 \u2013\nCU99,000 33,000 132,000 33,000 \u2013  \nTotal 132,000 \u2013  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE51-->## Share-based payment arrangements with cash alternatives  \nIG20 Some employee share-based payment arrangements permit the employee to choose whether to receive cash\nor equity instruments. In this situation, a compound financial instrument has been granted, ie a financial\ninstrument with debt and equity components. Paragraph 37 of the Standard requires the entity to estimate\nthe fair value of the compound financial instrument at grant date, by first measuring the fair value of the\ndebt component, and then measuring the fair value of the equity component\u2014taking into account that the\nemployee must forfeit the right to receive cash to receive the equity instrument.  \nIG21 Typically, share-based payment arrangements with cash alternatives are structured so that the fair value of\none settlement alternative is the same as the other. For example, the employee might have the choice of\nreceiving share options or cash share appreciation rights. In such cases, the fair value of the equity\ncomponent will be zero, and hence the fair value of the compound financial instrument will be the same as\nthe fair value of the debt component. However, if the fair values of the settlement alternatives differ, usually\nthe fair value of the equity component will be greater than zero, in which case the fair value of the\ncompound financial instrument will be greater than the fair value of the debt component.  \nIG22 Paragraph 38 of the Standard requires the entity to account separately for the services received in respect of\neach component of the compound financial instrument. For the debt component, the entity recognises the\nservices received, and a liability to pay for those services, as the counterparty renders service, in accordance\nwith the requirements applying to cash-settled share-based payment transactions. For the equity component\n(if any), the entity recognises the services received, and an increase in equity, as the counterparty renders\nservice, in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\nExample 13 illustrates these requirements.  \n**IG Example 13**  \n**Background**  \nAn entity grants to an employee the right to choose either 1,000 phantom shares, ie a right to a cash\npayment equal to the value of 1,000 shares, or 1,200 shares. The grant is conditional upon the completion\nof three years\u2019 service. If the employee chooses the share alternative, the shares must be held for three\nyears after vesting date.  \nAt grant date, the entity\u2019s share price is CU50 per share. At the end of years 1, 2 and 3, the share price is\nCU52, CU55 and CU60 respectively. The entity does not expect to pay dividends in the next three years.\nAfter taking into account the effects of the post-vesting transfer restrictions, the entity estimates that the\ngrant date fair value of the share alternative is CU48 per share.  \nAt the end of year 3, the employee chooses:  \nScenario 1: The cash alternative  \nScenario 2: The equity alternative  \n**Application of requirements**  \nThe fair value of the equity alternative is CU57,600 (1,200 shares \u00d7 CU48). The fair value of the cash\nalternative is CU50,000 (1,000 phantom shares \u00d7 CU50). Therefore, the fair value of the equity\ncomponent of the compound instrument is CU7,600 (CU57,600 \u2013 CU50,000).  \nThe entity recognises the following amounts:  \nYear Expense Equity Liability  \nCU CU CU  \n1 Liability component:\n(1,000 \u00d7 CU52 \u00d7 [1]/3) 17,333 17,333  \nEquity component:\n(CU7,600 \u00d7 [1]/3) 2,533 2,533  \n2 Liability component:\n(1,000 \u00d7 CU55 \u00d7 [2]/3) \u2013 CU17,333 19,333 19,333  \nEquity component:\n(CU7,600 \u00d7 [1]/3) 2,533 2,533  \n-----  \n<!--PAGE52-->**IG Example 13**  \n3 Liability component:\n(1,000 \u00d7 CU60) \u2013 CU36,666 23,334 23,334  \nEquity component:\n(CU7,600 \u00d7 [1]/3) 2,534 2,534  \nEnd\nYear  \nScenario 1: cash of CU60,000 paid  \nScenario 1 totals 67,600 7,600 0  \nScenario 2: 1,200 shares issued 60,000 (60,000)  \nScenario 2 totals 67,600 67,600 0",

Example 14 illustrates the journal entries in the separate or individual financial\nstatements for a group transaction in which a parent grants rights to its equity instruments to the employees\nof its subsidiary.  \n**IG Example 14**  \n_Share-based payment transactions in which a parent grants rights to its equity instruments to the_\n_employees of its subsidiary_  \n**Background**  \nA parent grants 200 share options to each of 100 employees of its subsidiary, conditional upon the\ncompletion of two years\u2019 service with the subsidiary. The fair value of the share options on grant date is\nCU30 each. At grant date, the subsidiary estimates that 80 per cent of the employees will complete the\ntwo-year service period. This estimate does not change during the vesting period. At the end of the\nvesting period, 81 employees complete the required two years of service. The parent does not require the\nsubsidiary to pay for the shares needed to settle the grant of share options.  \n**Application of requirements**  \nAs required by paragraph B53 of the Standard, over the two-year vesting period, the subsidiary measures\nthe services received from the employees in accordance with the requirements applicable to equitysettled share-based payment transactions. Thus, the subsidiary measures the services received from the\nemployees on the basis of the fair value of the share options at grant date.

This was\ncalculated by applying a binomial option pricing model. The model inputs were the share price at grant date of CU50,\nexercise price of CU50, expected volatility of 30 per cent, no expected dividends, contractual life of ten years, and a\nrisk-free interest rate of 5 per cent. To allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would\nexercise the options after vesting date when the share price was twice the exercise price. Historical volatility was 40\nper cent, which includes the early years of the Company\u2019s life; the Company expects the volatility of its share price to\nreduce as it matures.  \nThe estimated fair value of each share granted in the executive share plan is CU50.00, which is equal to the share\nprice at the date of grant.  \nFurther details of the two share option plans are as follows:  \n20X4 20X5  \nNumber of  \noptions  \nWeighted  \naverage  \nexercise price  \nNumber of  \noptions  \nWeighted  \naverage  \nexercise price  \nOutstanding at start of year 0 \u2013 45,000 CU40  \nGranted 50,000 CU40 75,000 CU50  \nForfeited (5,000) CU40 (8,000) CU46  \nExercised 0 \u2013 (4,000) CU40  \nOutstanding at end of year 45,000 CU40 108,000 CU46  \nExercisable at end of year 0 CU40 38,000 CU40  \nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was CU52. The\noptions outstanding at 31 December 20X5 had an exercise price of CU40 or CU50, and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 8.64 years.  \n10 Note that the illustrative example is not intended to be a template or model and is therefore not exhaustive.
