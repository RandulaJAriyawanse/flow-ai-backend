It incorporates\nrelevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 20 December 2021\n(see Compilation Details).\n\n# Accounting Standard AASB 2 Share-based Payment\n\n Objective\n\n1 The objective of this Standard is to specify the financial reporting by an entity when it undertakes a share_based payment transaction. In particular, it requires an entity to reflect in its profit or loss and financial_\nposition the effects of share-based payment transactions, including expenses associated with transactions in\nwhich share options are granted to employees.\n\nAusCF1 AusCF paragraphs and footnotes included in this Standard apply only to:\n\n(a) not-for-profit entities; and\n\n(b) for-profit entities that are not applying the _Conceptual Framework for Financial_\n_Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards)._\n\nSuch entities are referred to as \u2018AusCF entities\u2019. For AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is\ndefined in AASB 1057 _Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of_\nAccounting Concepts SAC 1 _Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities_\napplying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of\nthe Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF paragraphs or footnotes.\n\n# Scope\n\n2 An entity shall apply this Standard in accounting for all share-based payment transactions, whether or not\nthe entity can identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received, including:\n\n(a) _equity-settled share-based payment transactions,_\n\n(b) _cash-settled share-based payment transactions, and_\n\n(c) transactions in which the entity receives or acquires goods or services and the terms of the\narrangement provide either the entity or the supplier of those goods or services with a choice of\nwhether the entity settles the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by issuing equity instruments,\n\nexcept as noted in paragraphs 3A\u20136. In the absence of specifically identifiable goods or services, other\ncircumstances may indicate that goods or services have been (or will be) received, in which case this\nStandard applies.\n\n3 [Deleted]\n\n3A A share-based payment transaction may be settled by another group entity (or a shareholder of any group\nentity) on behalf of the entity receiving or acquiring the goods or services. Paragraph 2 also applies to an\nentity that\n\n(a) receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group\nentity) has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction, or\n\n(b) has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same\ngroup receives the goods or services\n\nunless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity\nreceiving them.\n\n\n-----\n\n",

        "page_content": "4 For the purposes of this Standard, a transaction with an employee (or other party) in his/her capacity as a\nholder of equity instruments of the entity is not a share-based payment transaction. For example, if an entity\ngrants all holders of a particular class of its equity instruments the right to acquire additional equity\ninstruments of the entity at a price that is less than the fair value of those equity instruments, and an\nemployee receives such a right because he/she is a holder of equity instruments of that particular class, the\ngranting or exercise of that right is not subject to the requirements of this Standard.\n\n5 As noted in paragraph 2, this Standard applies to share-based payment transactions in which an entity\nacquires or receives goods or services. Goods includes inventories, consumables, property, plant and\nequipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets. However, an entity shall not apply this Standard\nto transactions in which the entity acquires goods as part of the net assets acquired in a business\ncombination as defined by AASB 3 Business Combinations, in a combination of entities or businesses under\ncommon control as described in paragraphs B1\u2013B4 of AASB 3, or the contribution of a business on the\nformation of a joint venture as defined by AASB 11 Joint Arrangements. Hence, equity instruments issued\nin a business combination in exchange for control of the acquiree are not within the scope of this Standard.\nHowever, equity instruments granted to employees of the acquiree in their capacity as employees (eg in\nreturn for continued service) are within the scope of this Standard. Similarly, the cancellation, replacement\nor other modification of _share-based payment arrangements because of a business combination or other_\nequity restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this Standard. AASB 3 provides guidance on\ndetermining whether equity instruments issued in a business combination are part of the consideration\ntransferred in exchange for control of the acquiree (and therefore within the scope of AASB 3) or are in\nreturn for continued service to be recognised in the post-combination period (and therefore within the scope\nof this Standard).\n\n6 This Standard does not apply to share-based payment transactions in which the entity receives or acquires\ngoods or services under a contract within the scope of paragraphs 8\u201310 of AASB 132 _Financial_\n_Instruments: Presentation[1] or paragraphs 2.4\u20132.7 of AASB 9 Financial Instruments._\n\n6A This Standard uses the term \u2018fair value\u2019 in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of fair\nvalue in AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement. Therefore, when applying AASB 2 an entity measures fair_\nvalue in accordance with this Standard, not AASB 13.\n\n# Recognition\n\n**7** **An entity shall recognise the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment**\n**transaction when it obtains the goods or as the services are received. The entity shall recognise a**\n**corresponding increase in equity if the goods or services were received in an equity-settled share-**\n**based payment transaction, or a liability if the goods or services were acquired in a cash-settled**\n**share-based payment transaction.**\n\n**8** **When the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction do not qualify**\n**for recognition as assets, they shall be recognised as expenses.**\n\n9 Typically, an expense arises from the consumption of goods or services. For example, services are typically\nconsumed immediately, in which case an expense is recognised as the counterparty renders service. Goods\nmight be consumed over a period of time or, in the case of inventories, sold at a later date, in which case an\nexpense is recognised when the goods are consumed or sold. However, sometimes it is necessary to\nrecognise an expense before the goods or services are consumed or sold, because they do not qualify for\nrecognition as assets. For example, an entity might acquire goods as part of the research phase of a project\nto develop a new product. Although those goods have not been consumed, they might not qualify for\nrecognition as assets under the applicable Standard.\n\n# Equity-settled share-based payment transactions\n\n Overview\n\n**10** **For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the entity shall measure the goods or services**\n**received, and the corresponding increase in equity, directly, at the fair value of the goods or services**\n**received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the**\n**fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the**\n\n1 The title of AASB 132 was amended in 2005.\n\n\n-----\n\n",
