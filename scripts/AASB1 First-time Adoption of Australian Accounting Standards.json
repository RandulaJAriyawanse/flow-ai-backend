This compiled version of AASB 1 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 but before 1 July 2026. It incorporates relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 15 December 2022 (see Compilation Details).\n\n# Accounting Standard AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards\n\nObjective\n\n1. The objective of this Standard is to ensure that an entity\u2019s first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements, and its interim financial reports for part of the period covered by those financial statements, contain high quality information that:\n- (a) is transparent for users and comparable over all periods presented;\n- (b) provides a suitable starting point for accounting in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards; and\n- (c) can be generated at a cost that does not exceed the benefits.\n\nScope\n\n1. An entity shall apply this Standard in:\n- (a) its first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements; and\n- (b) each interim financial report, if any, that it presents in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting for part of the period covered by its first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements.\n2. An entity\u2019s first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements are the first annual financial statements in which the entity adopts Australian Accounting Standards, by an explicit and unreserved statement in those financial statements of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards. Financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards are an entity\u2019s first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements if, for example, the entity:\n- (a) presented its most recent previous financial statements:\n- (i) in accordance with national requirements that are not consistent with Australian Accounting Standards or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in all respects;\n- (ii) in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs in all respects, except that the financial statements did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement that they complied with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs;\n- (iii) containing an explicit statement of compliance with some, but not all, Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs;\n- (iv) in accordance with national requirements inconsistent with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs, using some individual Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs to account for items for which national requirements did not exist;\n\n1 [Aus] The term \u2018Australian Accounting Standards\u2019 refers to Standards (including Interpretations) made by the AASB that apply to any reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2005. In this context, the term encompasses Australian Accounting Standards \u2013 Simplified Disclosures, which some entities are permitted to apply in accordance with AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards in preparing general purpose financial statements.",

In these cases, the conditions specified in paragraph 3 for the application of this Standard are taken to be satisfied provided the entity:\n\n(a) discloses in its first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements:\n\n- (i) an explanation of information deficiencies and its strategy for rectifying those deficiencies; and\n- (ii) the Australian Accounting Standards that have not been complied with; and\n\n(b) makes an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with other Australian Accounting Standards for which there are no information deficiencies.\n\n# 4 This Standard applies when an entity first adopts Australian Accounting Standards. It does not apply when, for example, an entity:\n\n(a) stops presenting financial statements in accordance with national requirements, having previously presented them as well as another set of financial statements that contained an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs;\n\n(b) presented financial statements in the previous year in accordance with national requirements and those financial statements contained an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs; or\n\n(c) presented financial statements in the previous year that contained an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs, even if the auditors qualified their audit report on those financial statements.\n\n# 4A Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs 2 and 3, an entity that has applied Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs in a previous reporting period, but whose most recent previous annual financial statements did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs, must either apply this Standard or else apply Australian Accounting Standards retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors as if the entity had never stopped applying Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs.\n\n# 4B When an entity does not elect to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph 4A, the entity shall nevertheless apply the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 23A\u201323B of AASB 1, in addition to the disclosure requirements in AASB 108.\n\n# 5 This Standard does not apply to changes in accounting policies made by an entity that already applies Australian Accounting Standards. Such changes are the subject of:\n\n(a) requirements on changes in accounting policies in AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors; and\n\n(b) specific transitional requirements in other Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n# AASB 1-compiled\n\nAuthorised Version F2023C00177 registered 09/02/2023",

Entity A decides to present comparative information in those financial statements for one year only (see paragraph 21). Therefore, its date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards is the beginning of business on 1 January 20X4 (or, equivalently, close of business on 31 December 20X3). Entity A presented financial statements in accordance with its previous GAAP annually to 31 December each year up to, and including, 31 December 20X4.\n\nApplication of requirements\n\nEntity A is required to apply the Australian Accounting Standards effective for periods ending on 31 December 20X5 in:\n\n1. preparing and presenting its opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position at 1 January 20X4; and\n2. preparing and presenting its statement of financial position for 31 December 20X5 (including comparative amounts for 20X4), statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year to 31 December 20X5 (including comparative amounts for 20X4) and disclosures (including comparative information for 20X4).\n\nIf a new Standard is not yet mandatory but permits early application, entity A is permitted, but not required, to apply that Standard in its first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements.\n\n# 9\n\nThe transitional provisions in other Australian Accounting Standards apply to changes in accounting policies made by an entity that already uses Australian Accounting Standards; they do not apply to a first-time adopter\u2019s transition to Australian Accounting Standards, except as specified in Appendices B\u2013E.\n\n# 10\n\nExcept as described in paragraphs 13\u201319 and Appendices B\u2013E, an entity shall, in its opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position:\n\n1. recognise all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by Australian Accounting Standards;\n2. not recognise items as assets or liabilities if Australian Accounting Standards do not permit such recognition;\n3. reclassify items that it recognised in accordance with previous GAAP as one type of asset, liability or component of equity, but are a different type of asset, liability or component of equity in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards;",

The resulting adjustments arise from events and transactions before the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards. Therefore, an entity shall recognise those adjustments directly in retained earnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity) at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n12 This Standard establishes two categories of exceptions to the principle that an entity\u2019s opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position shall comply with each Australian Accounting Standard:\n\n- (a) paragraphs 14\u201317 and Appendix B prohibit retrospective application of some aspects of other Australian Accounting Standards.\n- (b) Appendices C\u2013E grant exemptions from some requirements of other Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nAus12.1 Entities that elect to apply AASB 1060 General Purpose Financial Statements \u2013 Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities to periods beginning before 1 July 2021 (ie early application) may also elect to apply the short-term exemptions from restating comparative information set out in AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards Appendix E, where applicable. For entities that apply that relief, references to the \u2018date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards\u2019 in this Standard shall mean the beginning of the first Australian-Accounting-Standards reporting period.\n\n# Exceptions to the retrospective application of other Australian Accounting Standards\n\n13 This Standard prohibits retrospective application of some aspects of other Australian Accounting Standards. These exceptions are set out in paragraphs 14\u201317 and Appendix B.\n\n# Estimates\n\n14 An entity\u2019s estimates in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards shall be consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error.\n\n15 An entity may receive information after the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards about estimates that it had made under previous GAAP. In accordance with paragraph 14, an entity shall treat the receipt of that information in the same way as non-adjusting events after the reporting period in accordance with AASB 110 Events after the Reporting Period. For example, assume that an entity\u2019s date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards is 1 January 20X4 and new information on 15 July 20X4 requires the revision of an estimate made in accordance with previous GAAP at 31 December 20X3. The entity shall not reflect that new information in its opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position (unless the estimates need adjustment for any differences in accounting policies or there is objective evidence that the estimates were in error). Instead, the entity shall reflect that new information in profit or loss (or, if appropriate, other comprehensive income) for the year ended 31 December 20X4.\n\n16 An entity may need to make estimates in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards that were not required at that date under previous GAAP. To achieve consistency with AASB 110, those estimates in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards shall reflect conditions that existed at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards. In particular, estimates at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards of market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates shall reflect market conditions at that date.\n\n17 Paragraphs 14\u201316 apply to the opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position. They also apply to a comparative period presented in an entity\u2019s first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements, in which case the references to the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards are replaced by references to the end of that comparative period.\n\n# Exemptions from other Australian Accounting Standards\n\n18 An entity may elect to use one or more of the exemptions contained in Appendices C\u2013E. An entity shall not apply these exemptions by analogy to other items.\n\nAASB 1-compiled 9 STANDARD Authorised Version F2023C00177 registered 09/02/2023",

Similarly, if (f) above requires the first-time adopter to recognise an intangible asset that was subsumed in recognised goodwill in accordance with previous GAAP, the first-time adopter shall decrease the carrying amount of goodwill accordingly (and, if applicable, adjust deferred tax and non-controlling interests).|\n| |(ii) Regardless of whether there is any indication that the goodwill may be impaired, the first-time adopter shall apply AASB 136 in testing the goodwill for impairment at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards and in recognising any resulting impairment loss in retained earnings (or, if so required by AASB 136, in revaluation surplus). The impairment test shall be based on conditions at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards.|\n|(h)|No other adjustments shall be made to the carrying amount of goodwill at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards. For example, the first-time adopter shall not restate the carrying amount of goodwill:|\n| |(i) to exclude in-process research and development acquired in that business combination (unless the related intangible asset would qualify for recognition in accordance with AASB 138 in the statement of financial position of the acquiree);|\n| |(ii) to adjust previous amortisation of goodwill;|\n\nSuch changes include reclassifications from or to intangible assets if goodwill was not recognised in accordance with previous GAAP as an asset. This arises if, in accordance with previous GAAP, the entity (a) deducted goodwill directly from equity or (b) did not treat the business combination as an acquisition.\n\nAASB 1-compiled 20 APPENDIX C\n\nAuthorised Version F2023C00177 registered 09/02/2023",
