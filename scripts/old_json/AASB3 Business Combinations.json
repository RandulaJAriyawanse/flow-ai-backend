        "text": "# Accounting Standard AASB 3\n\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board made Accounting Standard AASB 3 Business Combinations under section 334 of the Corporations Act 2001 on 7 August 2015. This compiled version of AASB 3 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 but before 1 July 2026. It incorporates relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 15 December 2022 (see Compilation Details).\n\n# Accounting Standard AASB 3 Business Combinations\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of this Standard is to improve the relevance, reliability and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this Standard establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer:\n\n- (a) recognises and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree;\n- (b) recognises and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and\n- (c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.\n\nAusCF1\n\nAusCF paragraphs and footnotes included in this Standard apply only to:\n\n- (a) not-for-profit entities; and\n- (b) for-profit entities that are not applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards).\n\nSuch entities are referred to as \u2018AusCF entities\u2019. For AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is defined in AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF paragraphs or footnotes.\n\nAus1.1\n\nWhere assets and liabilities are transferred to a local government from another local government at no cost, or for nominal consideration, pursuant to legislation, ministerial directive or other externally imposed requirement, paragraphs Aus63.1\u2013Aus63.9 shall be applied.\n\nScope\n\nThis Standard applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. This Standard does not apply to:\n\n- (a) the accounting for the formation of a joint arrangement in the financial statements of the joint arrangement itself.\n- (b) the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business. In such cases the acquirer shall identify and recognise the individual identifiable assets acquired (including those assets that meet the definition of, and recognition criteria for, intangible assets in AASB 138 Intangible Assets) and liabilities assumed. The cost of the group shall be allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase. Such a transaction or event does not give rise to goodwill.\n- (c) a combination of entities or businesses under common control (paragraphs B1\u2013B4 provide related application guidance).\n\nAASB 3-compiled\n\nAuthorised Version F2023C00389 registered 28/04/2023",

AASB 1004 specifies requirements for restructures of administrative arrangements.\n\nThe requirements of this Standard do not apply to the acquisition by an investment entity, as defined in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, of an investment in a subsidiary that is required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n# Identifying a business combination\n\nAn entity shall determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination by applying the definition in this Standard, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. If the assets acquired are not a business, the reporting entity shall account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Paragraphs B5\u2013B12D provide guidance on identifying a business combination and the definition of a business.\n\n# The acquisition method\n\nAn entity shall account for each business combination by applying the acquisition method.\n\nApplying the acquisition method requires:\n\n(a) identifying the acquirer;(b) determining the acquisition date;(c) recognising and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and(d) recognising and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n\n# Identifying the acquirer\n\nFor each business combination, one of the combining entities shall be identified as the acquirer.\n\nThe guidance in AASB 10 shall be used to identify the acquirer\u2014the entity that obtains control of another entity, i.e., the acquiree. If a business combination has occurred but applying the guidance in AASB 10 does not clearly indicate which of the combining entities is the acquirer, the factors in paragraphs B14\u2013B18 shall be considered in making that determination.\n\n# Determining the acquisition date\n\nThe acquirer shall identify the acquisition date, which is the date on which it obtains control of the acquiree.\n\nThe date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree is generally the date on which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration, acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the acquiree\u2014the closing date. However, the acquirer might obtain control on a date that is either earlier or later than the closing date. For example, the acquisition date precedes the closing date if a written agreement provides that the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree on a date before the closing date. An acquirer shall consider all pertinent facts and circumstances in identifying the acquisition date.\n\n# Recognising and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree\n\nRecognition principle\n\nAs of the acquisition date, the acquirer shall recognise, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

        "text": "# Recognition conditions\n\n11 To qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards) at the acquisition date. For example, costs the acquirer expects but is not obliged to incur in the future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of or relocate an acquiree\u2019s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date. Therefore, the acquirer does not recognise those costs as part of applying the acquisition method. Instead, the acquirer recognises those costs in its post-combination financial statements in accordance with other Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nAusCF11\nNotwithstanding paragraph 11, in respect of AusCF entities, to qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards)AusCF1 at the acquisition date. For example, costs the acquirer expects but is not obliged to incur in the future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of or relocate an acquiree\u2019s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date. Therefore, the acquirer does not recognise those costs as part of applying the acquisition method. Instead, the acquirer recognises those costs in its post-combination financial statements in accordance with other Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n12 In addition, to qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be part of what the acquirer and the acquiree (or its former owners) exchanged in the business combination transaction rather than the result of separate transactions. The acquirer shall apply the guidance in paragraphs 51\u201353 to determine which assets acquired or liabilities assumed are part of the exchange for the acquiree and which, if any, are the result of separate transactions to be accounted for in accordance with their nature and the applicable Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n13 The acquirer\u2019s application of the recognition principle and conditions may result in recognizing some assets and liabilities that the acquiree had not previously recognized as assets and liabilities in its financial statements. For example, the acquirer recognizes the acquired identifiable intangible assets, such as a brand name, a patent or a customer relationship, that the acquiree did not recognize as assets in its financial statements because it developed them internally and charged the related costs to expense.\n\n14 Paragraphs B31\u2013B40 provide guidance on recognizing intangible assets. Paragraphs 21A\u201328B specify the types of identifiable assets and liabilities that include items for which this Standard provides limited exceptions to the recognition principle and conditions.\n\n# Classifying or designating identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination\n\n15 At the acquisition date, the acquirer shall classify or designate the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as necessary to apply other Australian Accounting Standards subsequently. The acquirer shall make those classifications or designations on the basis of the contractual terms, economic conditions, its operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date.\n\n16 In some situations, Australian Accounting Standards provide for different accounting depending on how an entity classifies or designates a particular asset or liability. Examples of classifications or designations that the acquirer shall make on the basis of the pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date include but are not limited to:\n\n- (a) classification of particular financial assets and liabilities as measured at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost, or as a financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments;\n- (b) designation of a derivative instrument as a hedging instrument in accordance with AASB 9; and\n- (c) assessment of whether an embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract in accordance with AASB 9 (which is a matter of \u2018classification\u2019 as this Standard uses that term).\n\nAusCF1 In respect of AusCF entities, in December 2013 the AASB amended the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.",

Paragraphs 21A\u201331A specify both the particular items for which exceptions are provided and the nature of those exceptions. The acquirer shall account for those items by applying the requirements in paragraphs 21A\u201331A, which will result in some items being:\n\n(a) recognised either by applying recognition conditions in addition to those in paragraphs 11 and 12 or by applying the requirements of other Australian Accounting Standards, with results that differ from applying the recognition principle and conditions.\n\n(b) measured at an amount other than their acquisition-date fair values.\n\n# Exceptions to the recognition principle\n\n# Liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of AASB 137 or Interpretation 21\n\n21A Paragraph 21B applies to liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or Interpretation 21 Levies (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards) if they were incurred separately rather than assumed in a business combination.\n\n21B The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting defines a liability as \u2018a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events\u2019.

Therefore, contrary to paragraphs 14(b), 23, 27, 29 and 30 of AASB 137, the acquirer recognises a contingent liability assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

For example, the seller may indemnify the acquirer against losses above a specified amount on a liability arising from a particular contingency; in other words, the seller will guarantee that the acquirer\u2019s liability will not exceed a specified amount. As a result, the acquirer obtains an indemnification asset. The acquirer shall recognise an indemnification asset at the same time that it recognises the indemnified item measured on the same basis as the indemnified item, subject to the need for a valuation allowance for uncollectible amounts. Therefore, if the indemnification relates to an asset or a liability that is recognised at the acquisition date and measured at its acquisition-date fair value, the acquirer shall recognise the indemnification asset at the acquisition date measured at its acquisition-date fair value.

To determine the amount of goodwill in a business combination in which no consideration is transferred, the acquirer shall use the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer\u2019s interest in the acquiree in place of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred (paragraph 32(a)(i)). Paragraphs B46\u2013B49 provide related application guidance.\n\nBargain purchases\n\n34 Occasionally, an acquirer will make a bargain purchase, which is a business combination in which the amount in paragraph 32(b) exceeds the aggregate of the amounts specified in paragraph 32(a). If that excess remains after applying the requirements in paragraph 36, the acquirer shall recognise the resulting gain in profit or loss on the acquisition date. The gain shall be attributed to the acquirer.\n\n35 A bargain purchase might happen, for example, in a business combination that is a forced sale in which the seller is acting under compulsion. However, the recognition or measurement exceptions for particular items discussed in paragraphs 22\u201331A may also result in recognising a gain (or change the amount of a recognised gain) on a bargain purchase.\n\n36 Before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review. The acquirer shall then review the procedures used to measure the amounts this Standard requires to be recognised at the acquisition date for all of the following:\n\n(a) the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed;(b) the non-controlling interest in the acquiree, if any;(c) for a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer\u2019s previously held equity interest in the acquiree;(d) the consideration transferred.\nThe objective of the review is to ensure that the measurements appropriately reflect consideration of all available information as of the acquisition date.\n\nConsideration transferred\n\n37 The consideration transferred in a business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. (However, any portion of the acquirer\u2019s share-based payment awards exchanged for awards held by the acquiree\u2019s employees that is included in consideration transferred in the business combination shall be measured in accordance with paragraph 30 rather than at fair value.)

If so, the acquirer shall remeasure the transferred assets or liabilities to their fair values as of the acquisition date and recognise the resulting gains or losses, if any, in profit or loss. However, sometimes the transferred assets or liabilities remain within the combined entity after the business combination (for example, because the assets or liabilities were transferred to the acquiree rather than to its former owners), and the acquirer therefore retains control of them. In that situation, the acquirer shall measure those assets and liabilities at their carrying amounts immediately before the acquisition date and shall not recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss on assets or liabilities it controls both before and after the business combination.\n\n# Contingent consideration\n\nThe consideration the acquirer transfers in exchange for the acquiree includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement (see paragraph 37). The acquirer shall recognise the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree.\n\nThe acquirer shall classify an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument as a financial liability or as equity on the basis of the definitions of an equity instrument and a financial liability in paragraph 11 of AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation. The acquirer shall classify as an asset a right to the return of previously transferred consideration if specified conditions are met. Paragraph 58 provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for contingent consideration.\n\n# Additional guidance for applying the acquisition method to particular types of business combinations\n\nA business combination achieved in stages\n\nAn acquirer sometimes obtains control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date. For example, on 31 December 20X1, Entity A holds a 35 per cent non-controlling equity interest in Entity B. On that date, Entity A purchases an additional 40 per cent interest in Entity B, which gives it control of Entity B. This Standard refers to such a transaction as a business combination achieved in stages, sometimes also referred to as a step acquisition.\n\nIn a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. In prior reporting periods, the acquirer may have recognised changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognised in other comprehensive income shall be recognised on the same basis as would be required if the acquirer had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.\n\nWhen a party to a joint arrangement (as defined in AASB 11 Joint Arrangements) obtains control of a business that is a joint operation (as defined in AASB 11), and had rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination achieved in stages. The acquirer shall therefore apply the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including remeasuring its previously held interest in the joint operation in the manner described in paragraph 42. In doing so, the acquirer shall remeasure its entire previously held interest in the joint operation.\n\nA business combination achieved without the transfer of consideration\n\nAn acquirer sometimes obtains control of an acquiree without transferring consideration. The acquisition method of accounting for a business combination applies to those combinations. Such circumstances include:\n\n- (a) The acquiree repurchases a sufficient number of its own shares for an existing investor (the acquirer) to obtain control.\n- (b) Minority veto rights lapse that previously kept the acquirer from controlling an acquiree in which the acquirer held the majority voting rights.",

        "text": "# (c) The acquirer and acquiree agree to combine their businesses by contract alone.\n\nThe acquirer transfers no consideration in exchange for control of an acquiree and holds no equity interests in the acquiree, either on the acquisition date or previously. Examples of business combinations achieved by contract alone include bringing two businesses together in a stapling arrangement or forming a dual listed corporation.\n\n# Measurement period\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the acquirer shall report in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement period, the acquirer shall retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognised as of that date. During the measurement period, the acquirer shall also recognise additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. The measurement period ends as soon as the acquirer receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable. However, the measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\n# The measurement period\n\nThe measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the provisional amounts recognised for a business combination. The measurement period provides the acquirer with a reasonable time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the following as of the acquisition date in accordance with the requirements of this Standard:\n\n- (a) the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree;\n- (b) the consideration transferred for the acquiree (or the other amount used in measuring goodwill);\n- (c) in a business combination achieved in stages, the equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the acquirer; and\n- (d) the resulting goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase.\n\n# Adjustments during the measurement period\n\nThe acquirer shall consider all pertinent factors in determining whether information obtained after the acquisition date should result in an adjustment to the provisional amounts recognised or whether that information results from events that occurred after the acquisition date. Pertinent factors include the date when additional information is obtained and whether the acquirer can identify a reason for a change to provisional amounts. Information that is obtained shortly after the acquisition date is more likely to reflect circumstances that existed at the acquisition date than is information obtained several months later. For example, unless an intervening event that changed its fair value can be identified, the sale of an asset to a third party shortly after the acquisition date for an amount that differs significantly from its provisional fair value measured at that date is likely to indicate an error in the provisional amount.\n\nThe acquirer recognises an increase (decrease) in the provisional amount recognised for an identifiable asset (liability) by means of a decrease (increase) in goodwill. However, new information obtained during the measurement period may sometimes result in an adjustment to the provisional amount of more than one asset or liability. For example, the acquirer might have assumed a liability to pay damages related to an accident in one of the acquiree\u2019s facilities, part or all of which are covered by the acquiree\u2019s liability insurance policy. If the acquirer obtains new information during the measurement period about the acquisition-date fair value of that liability, the adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the liability would be offset (in whole or in part) by a corresponding adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the claim receivable from the insurer.\n\nDuring the measurement period, the acquirer shall recognise adjustments to the provisional amounts as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed at the acquisition date. Thus, the acquirer shall revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed, including making any change in depreciation, amortisation or other income effects recognised in completing the initial accounting.",

In either situation, the acquirer shall identify any amounts that are not part of what the acquirer and the acquiree (or its former owners) exchanged in the business combination, i.e., amounts that are not part of the exchange for the acquiree. The acquirer shall recognize as part of applying the acquisition method only the consideration transferred for the acquiree and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the exchange for the acquiree. Separate transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with the relevant Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nA transaction entered into by or on behalf of the acquirer or primarily for the benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity, rather than primarily for the benefit of the acquiree (or its former owners) before the combination, is likely to be a separate transaction. The following are examples of separate transactions that are not to be included in applying the acquisition method:\n\n(a) a transaction that in effect settles pre-existing relationships between the acquirer and acquiree;(b) a transaction that remunerates employees or former owners of the acquiree for future services; and(c) a transaction that reimburses the acquiree or its former owners for paying the acquirer\u2019s acquisition-related costs.\nParagraphs B50\u2013B62 provide related application guidance.\n\nAcquisition-related costs\n\nAcquisition-related costs are costs the acquirer incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include finder\u2019s fees; advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees; general administrative costs, including the costs of maintaining an internal acquisitions department; and costs of registering and issuing debt and equity securities. The acquirer shall account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities shall be recognized in accordance with AASB 132 and AASB 9.\n\nSubsequent measurement and accounting\n\nIn general, an acquirer shall subsequently measure and account for assets acquired, liabilities assumed or incurred and equity instruments issued in a business combination in accordance with other applicable Australian Accounting Standards for those items, depending on their nature. However, this Standard provides guidance on subsequently measuring and accounting for the following assets acquired, liabilities assumed or incurred and equity instruments issued in a business combination:\n\n(a) reacquired rights;(b) contingent liabilities recognized as of the acquisition date;(c) indemnification assets; and(d) contingent consideration.\nParagraph B63 provides related application guidance.\n\nReacquired rights\n\nA reacquired right recognized as an intangible asset shall be amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. An acquirer that subsequently sells a reacquired right to a third party shall include the carrying amount of the intangible asset in determining the gain or loss on the sale.",

This gives rise to assets and liabilities and a gain or loss of the transferee local government. A restructure of local governments may take the form of a new local government being constituted and other local governments being abolished as a result of a State government\u2019s policy to effectively amalgamate a number of local governments.|\n|Aus63.4|A restructure of local governments involves a change in the resources controlled by the local governments involved in the restructure. The transferor local government will decrease its assets by the carrying amount of the assets transferred.

Such amounts provide a practical basis for recognising the transfer of assets, particularly when many assets are involved, as is usually the case in a restructure of local governments.

Paragraphs 65B\u201365E shall be applied in the subsequent accounting for those balances. Paragraphs 65B\u201365E shall not apply to the accounting for contingent consideration balances arising from business combinations with acquisition dates on or after the date when the entity first applied this Standard as issued in 2008. In paragraphs 65B\u201365E business combination refers exclusively to business combinations whose acquisition date preceded the application of this Standard as issued in 2008.\n\n# 65B\n\nIf a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the acquirer shall include the amount of that adjustment in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.\n\n# 65C\n\nA business combination agreement may allow for adjustments to the cost of the combination that are contingent on one or more future events. The adjustment might, for example, be contingent on a specified level of profit being maintained or achieved in future periods, or on the market price of the instruments issued being maintained. It is usually possible to estimate the amount of any such adjustment at the time of initially accounting for the combination without impairing the reliability of the information, even though some uncertainty exists. If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\n# 65D\n\nHowever, when a business combination agreement provides for such an adjustment, that adjustment is not included in the cost of the combination at the time of initially accounting for the combination if it either is not probable or cannot be measured reliably. If that adjustment subsequently becomes probable and can be measured reliably, the additional consideration shall be treated as an adjustment to the cost of the combination.\n\n# 65E\n\nIn some circumstances, the acquirer may be required to make a subsequent payment to the seller as compensation for a reduction in the value of the assets given, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred or assumed by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree. This is the case, for example, when the acquirer guarantees the market price of equity or debt instruments issued as part of the cost of the business combination and is required to issue additional equity or debt instruments to restore the originally determined cost. In such cases, no increase in the cost of the business combination is recognised. In the case of equity instruments, the fair value of the additional payment is offset by an equal reduction in the value attributed to the instruments initially issued.

A business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory.|\n|---|---|\n|B2|A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an entity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Therefore, a business combination is outside the scope of this Standard when the same group of individuals has, as a result of contractual arrangements, ultimate collective power to govern the financial and operating policies of each of the combining entities so as to obtain benefits from their activities, and that ultimate collective power is not transitory.|\n|B3|An entity may be controlled by an individual or by a group of individuals acting together under a contractual arrangement, and that individual or group of individuals may not be subject to the financial reporting requirements of Australian Accounting Standards. Therefore, it is not necessary for combining entities to be included as part of the same consolidated financial statements for a business combination to be regarded as one involving entities under common control.|\n|B4|The extent of non-controlling interests in each of the combining entities before and after the business combination is not relevant to determining whether the combination involves entities under common control. Similarly, the fact that one of the combining entities is a subsidiary that has been excluded from the consolidated financial statements is not relevant to determining whether a combination involves entities under common control.|\n\n# Identifying a business combination (application of paragraph 3)\n\n|B5|This Standard defines a business combination as a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. An acquirer might obtain control of an acquiree in a variety of ways, for example: - (a) by transferring cash, cash equivalents or other assets (including net assets that constitute a business);\n- (b) by incurring liabilities;\n- (c) by issuing equity interests;\n- (d) by providing more than one type of consideration; or\n- (e) without transferring consideration, including by contract alone (see paragraph 43).\n|\n|---|---|\n|B6|A business combination may be structured in a variety of ways for legal, taxation or other reasons, which include but are not limited to: - (a) one or more businesses become subsidiaries of an acquirer or the net assets of one or more businesses are legally merged into the acquirer;\n- (b) one combining entity transfers its net assets, or its owners transfer their equity interests, to another combining entity or its owners;\n- (c) all of the combining entities transfer their net assets, or the owners of those entities transfer their equity interests, to a newly formed entity (sometimes referred to as a roll-up or put-together transaction); or\n- (d) a group of former owners of one of the combining entities obtains control of the combined entity.\n|",

        "text": "# Definition of a business (application of paragraph 3)\n\n|B7|A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. The three elements of a business are defined as follows (see paragraphs B8\u2013B12D for guidance on the elements of a business):|\n|---|---|\n|(a) Input:|Any economic resource that creates outputs, or has the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs, when one or more processes are applied to it. Examples include non-current assets (including intangible assets or rights to use non-current assets), intellectual property, the ability to obtain access to necessary materials or rights and employees.|\n|(b) Process:|Any system, standard, protocol, convention or rule that, when applied to an input or inputs, creates outputs or has the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. Examples include strategic management processes, operational processes and resource management processes. These processes typically are documented, but the intellectual capacity of an organised workforce having the necessary skills and experience following rules and conventions may provide the necessary processes that are capable of being applied to inputs to create outputs. (Accounting, billing, payroll and other administrative systems typically are not processes used to create outputs.)|\n|(c) Output:|The result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods or services to customers, generate investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generate other income from ordinary activities.|\n\n# Optional test to identify concentration of fair value\n\n|B7A|Paragraph B7B sets out an optional test (the concentration test) to permit a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. An entity may elect to apply, or not apply, the test. An entity may make such an election separately for each transaction or other event. The concentration test has the following consequences:|\n|---|---|\n|(a)|if the concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further assessment is needed.|\n|(b)|if the concentration test is not met, or if the entity elects not to apply the test, the entity shall then perform the assessment set out in paragraphs B8\u2013B12D.|\n\n# The concentration test\n\n|B7B|The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. For the concentration test:|\n|---|---|\n|(a)|gross assets acquired shall exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities.|\n|(b)|the fair value of the gross assets acquired shall include any consideration transferred (plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest) in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. The fair value of the gross assets acquired may normally be determined as the total obtained by adding the fair value of the consideration transferred (plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest) to the fair value of the liabilities assumed (other than deferred tax liabilities), and then excluding the items identified in subparagraph (a). However, if the fair value of the gross assets acquired is more than that total, a more precise calculation may sometimes be needed.|\n|(c)|a single identifiable asset shall include any asset or group of assets that would be recognised and measured as a single identifiable asset in a business combination.|\n|(d)|if a tangible asset is attached to, and cannot be physically removed and used separately from, another tangible asset (or from an underlying asset subject to a lease, as defined in AASB 16 Leases), without incurring significant cost, or significant diminution in utility or fair value to either asset (for example, land and buildings), those assets shall be considered a single identifiable asset.|\n|(e)|when assessing whether assets are similar, an entity shall consider the nature of each single identifiable asset and the risks associated with managing and creating outputs from the assets (that is, the risk characteristics).|\n|(f)|the following shall not be considered similar assets:|\n| |(i) a tangible asset and an intangible asset;|",

To be capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose identified in the definition of a business, an integrated set of activities and assets requires two essential elements\u2014inputs and processes applied to those inputs. A business need not include all of the inputs or processes that the seller used in operating that business. However, to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Paragraphs B12\u2013B12D specify how to assess whether a process is substantive.\n\nB8A If an acquired set of activities and assets has outputs, continuation of revenue does not on its own indicate that both an input and a substantive process have been acquired.\n\nB9 The nature of the elements of a business varies by industry and by the structure of an entity\u2019s operations (activities), including the entity\u2019s stage of development. Established businesses often have many different types of inputs, processes and outputs, whereas new businesses often have few inputs and processes and sometimes only a single output (product). Nearly all businesses also have liabilities, but a business need not have liabilities. Furthermore, an acquired set of activities and assets that is not a business might have liabilities.\n\nB10 [Deleted]\n\nB11 Determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business shall be based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant. Thus, in evaluating whether a particular set is a business, it is not relevant whether a seller operated the set as a business or whether the acquirer intends to operate the set as a business.\n\n# Assessing whether an acquired process is substantive\n\nB12 Paragraphs B12A\u2013B12D explain how to assess whether an acquired process is substantive if the acquired set of activities and assets does not have outputs (paragraph B12B) and if it does have outputs (paragraph B12C).\n\nB12A An example of an acquired set of activities and assets that does not have outputs at the acquisition date is an early-stage entity that has not started generating revenue. Moreover, if an acquired set of activities and assets was generating revenue at the acquisition date, it is considered to have outputs at that date, even if subsequently it will no longer generate revenue from external customers, for example because it will be integrated by the acquirer.\n\nB12B If a set of activities and assets does not have outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of processes) shall be considered substantive only if:\n\n(a) it is critical to the ability to develop or convert an acquired input or inputs into outputs; and\n\n(b) the inputs acquired include both an organised workforce that has the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process (or group of processes) and other inputs that the organised workforce could develop or convert into outputs. Those other inputs could include:\n\n(i) intellectual property that could be used to develop a good or service;\n\n(ii) other economic resources that could be developed to create outputs; or",

If a new entity is formed to issue equity interests to effect a business combination, one of the combining entities that existed before the business combination shall be identified as the acquirer by applying the guidance in paragraphs B13\u2013B17. In contrast, a new entity that transfers cash or other assets or incurs liabilities as consideration may be the acquirer.|\n\n# Reverse acquisitions\n\nA reverse acquisition occurs when the entity that issues securities (the legal acquirer) is identified as the acquiree for accounting purposes on the basis of the guidance in paragraphs B13\u2013B18. The entity whose equity interests are acquired (the legal acquiree) must be the acquirer for accounting purposes for the transaction to be considered a reverse acquisition. For example, reverse acquisitions sometimes occur when a private operating entity wants to become a public entity but does not want to register its equity shares. To accomplish that, the private entity will arrange for a public entity to acquire its equity interests in exchange for the equity interests of the public entity. In this example, the public entity is the legal acquirer because it issued its equity interests, and the private entity is the legal acquiree because its equity interests were acquired. However, application of the guidance in paragraphs B13\u2013B18 results in identifying:\n\n|(a)|the public entity as the acquiree for accounting purposes (the accounting acquiree);|\n|---|---|\n|(b)|the private entity as the acquirer for accounting purposes (the accounting acquirer).|\n\nThe accounting acquiree must meet the definition of a business for the transaction to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition, and all of the recognition and measurement principles in this Standard, including the requirement to recognize goodwill, apply.\n\n# Measuring the consideration transferred\n\nIn a reverse acquisition, the accounting acquirer usually issues no consideration for the acquiree. Instead, the accounting acquiree usually issues its equity shares to the owners of the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer for its interest in the accounting acquiree is based on the number of equity interests the legal subsidiary would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal parent the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. The fair value of the number of equity interests calculated in that way can be used as the fair value of consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree.\n\n# Preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements\n\nConsolidated financial statements prepared following a reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) but described in the notes as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer), with one adjustment, which is to adjust retroactively the accounting acquirer\u2019s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in those consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).\n\n|B22|Because the consolidated financial statements represent the continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary except for its capital structure, the consolidated financial statements reflect:|\n|---|---|\n|(a)|the assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.|\n|(b)|the assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognized and measured in accordance with this Standard.|",

However, the equity structure (ie the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree), including the equity interests the legal parent issued to effect the combination. Accordingly, the equity structure of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) issued in the reverse acquisition.\n\n# (e) Non-Controlling Interest's Proportionate Share\n\nthe non-controlling interest\u2019s proportionate share of the legal subsidiary\u2019s (accounting acquirer\u2019s) pre-combination carrying amounts of retained earnings and other equity interests as discussed in paragraphs B23 and B24.\n\n# Non-Controlling Interest\n\n|B23|In a reverse acquisition, some of the owners of the legal acquiree (the accounting acquirer) might not exchange their equity interests for equity interests of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Those owners are treated as a non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements after the reverse acquisition. That is because the owners of the legal acquiree that do not exchange their equity interests for equity interests of the legal acquirer have an interest in only the results and net assets of the legal acquiree\u2014not in the results and net assets of the combined entity. Conversely, even though the legal acquirer is the acquiree for accounting purposes, the owners of the legal acquirer have an interest in the results and net assets of the combined entity.|\n|---|---|\n|B24|The assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are measured and recognised in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts (see paragraph B22(a)). Therefore, in a reverse acquisition the non-controlling interest reflects the non-controlling shareholders\u2019 proportionate interest in the pre-combination carrying amounts of the legal acquiree\u2019s net assets even if the non-controlling interests in other acquisitions are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.|\n\n# Earnings per Share\n\nAs noted in paragraph B22(d), the equity structure in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition reflects the equity structure of the legal acquirer (the accounting acquiree), including the equity interests issued by the legal acquirer to effect the business combination.\n\nIn calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings per share calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs:\n\n(a) the number of ordinary shares outstanding from the beginning of that period to the acquisition date shall be computed on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of the legal acquiree (accounting acquirer) outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the merger agreement; and\n\n(b) the number of ordinary shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of that period shall be the actual number of ordinary shares of the legal acquirer (the accounting acquiree) outstanding during that period.\n\nThe basic earnings per share for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition shall be calculated by dividing:\n\n(a) the profit or loss of the legal acquiree attributable to ordinary shareholders in each of those periods by\n\n(b) the legal acquiree\u2019s historical weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement.\n\n# Recognising Particular Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\n\n(application of paragraphs 10\u201313)\n\nB28 [Deleted]\n\nB29 [Deleted]",

An intangible asset is identifiable if it meets either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion.|\n|---|---|\n|B32|An intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion is identifiable even if the asset is not transferable or separable from the acquiree or from other rights and obligations. For example:|\n| |(b) an acquiree owns and operates a nuclear power plant. The licence to operate that power plant is an intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion for recognition separately from goodwill, even if the acquirer cannot sell or transfer it separately from the acquired power plant. An acquirer may recognise the fair value of the operating licence and the fair value of the power plant as a single asset for financial reporting purposes if the useful lives of those assets are similar.|\n| |(c) an acquiree owns a technology patent. It has licensed that patent to others for their exclusive use outside the domestic market, receiving a specified percentage of future foreign revenue in exchange. Both the technology patent and the related licence agreement meet the contractual-legal criterion for recognition separately from goodwill even if selling or exchanging the patent and the related licence agreement separately from one another would not be practical.|\n|B33|The separability criterion means that an acquired intangible asset is capable of being separated or divided from the acquiree and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability. An intangible asset that the acquirer would be able to sell, license or otherwise exchange for something else of value meets the separability criterion even if the acquirer does not intend to sell, license or otherwise exchange it. An acquired intangible asset meets the separability criterion if there is evidence of exchange transactions for that type of asset or an asset of a similar type, even if those transactions are infrequent and regardless of whether the acquirer is involved in them. For example, customer and subscriber lists are frequently licensed and thus meet the separability criterion. Even if an acquiree believes its customer lists have characteristics different from other customer lists, the fact that customer lists are frequently licensed generally means that the acquired customer list meets the separability criterion. However, a customer list acquired in a business combination would not meet the separability criterion if the terms of confidentiality or other agreements prohibit an entity from selling, leasing or otherwise exchanging information about its customers.|\n|B34|An intangible asset that is not individually separable from the acquiree or combined entity meets the separability criterion if it is separable in combination with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability. For example:|\n| |(a) market participants exchange deposit liabilities and related depositor relationship intangible assets in observable exchange transactions. Therefore, the acquirer should recognise the depositor relationship intangible asset separately from goodwill.|\n| |(b) an acquiree owns a registered trademark and documented but unpatented technical expertise used to manufacture the trademarked product. To transfer ownership of a trademark, the owner is also required to transfer everything else necessary for the new owner to produce a product or service indistinguishable from that produced by the former owner. Because the unpatented technical expertise must be separated from the acquiree or combined entity and sold if the related trademark is sold, it meets the separability criterion.|\n\n# Reacquired rights\n\n|B35|As part of a business combination, an acquirer may reacquire a right that it had previously granted to the acquiree to use one or more of the acquirer\u2019s recognised or unrecognised assets. Examples of such rights include a right to use the acquirer\u2019s trade name under a franchise agreement or a right to use the acquirer\u2019s technology under a technology licensing agreement. A reacquired right is an identifiable intangible asset that the acquirer recognises separately from goodwill. Paragraph 29 provides guidance on measuring a reacquired right and paragraph 55 provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for a reacquired right.|\n|---|---|\n|B36|If the terms of the contract giving rise to a reacquired right are favourable or unfavourable relative to the terms of current market transactions for the same or similar items, the acquirer shall recognise a settlement gain or loss.

        "text": "# Assembled Workforce and Other Items\n\n|B37|The acquirer subsumes into goodwill the value of an acquired intangible asset that is not identifiable as of the acquisition date. For example, an acquirer may attribute value to the existence of an assembled workforce, which is an existing collection of employees that permits the acquirer to continue to operate an acquired business from the acquisition date. An assembled workforce does not represent the intellectual capital of the skilled workforce\u2014the (often specialised) knowledge and experience that employees of an acquiree bring to their jobs. Because the assembled workforce is not an identifiable asset to be recognised separately from goodwill, any value attributed to it is subsumed into goodwill.|\n|---|---|\n| |The acquirer also subsumes into goodwill any value attributed to items that do not qualify as assets at the acquisition date. For example, the acquirer might attribute value to potential contracts the acquiree is negotiating with prospective new customers at the acquisition date. Because those potential contracts are not themselves assets at the acquisition date, the acquirer does not recognise them separately from goodwill. The acquirer should not subsequently reclassify the value of those contracts from goodwill for events that occur after the acquisition date. However, the acquirer should assess the facts and circumstances surrounding events occurring shortly after the acquisition to determine whether a separately recognisable intangible asset existed at the acquisition date.|\n| |After initial recognition, an acquirer accounts for intangible assets acquired in a business combination in accordance with the provisions of AASB 138 Intangible Assets. However, as described in paragraph 3 of AASB 138, the accounting for some acquired intangible assets after initial recognition is prescribed by other Australian Accounting Standards.|\n| |The identifiability criteria determine whether an intangible asset is recognised separately from goodwill. However, the criteria neither provide guidance for measuring the fair value of an intangible asset nor restrict the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset. For example, the acquirer would take into account the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the intangible asset, such as expectations of future contract renewals, in measuring fair value. It is not necessary for the renewals themselves to meet the identifiability criteria. (However, see paragraph 29, which establishes an exception to the fair value measurement principle for reacquired rights recognised in a business combination.) Paragraphs 36 and 37 of AASB 138 provide guidance for determining whether intangible assets should be combined into a single unit of account with other intangible or tangible assets.|\n\n# Measuring the Fair Value of Particular Identifiable Assets and a Non-Controlling Interest in an Acquiree\n\n| |Assets with uncertain cash flows (valuation allowances)|\n|---|---|\n|B41|The acquirer shall not recognise a separate valuation allowance as of the acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the fair value measure. For example, because this Standard requires the acquirer to measure acquired receivables, including loans, at their acquisition-date fair values in accounting for a business combination, the acquirer does not recognise a separate valuation allowance for the contractual cash flows that are deemed to be uncollectible at that date or a loss allowance for expected credit losses.|\n| |Assets subject to operating leases in which the acquiree is the lessor|\n|B42|In measuring the acquisition-date fair value of an asset such as a building or a patent that is subject to an operating lease in which the acquiree is the lessor, the acquirer shall take into account the terms of the lease. The acquirer does not recognise a separate asset or liability if the terms of an operating lease are either favourable or unfavourable when compared with market terms.|\n| |Assets that the acquirer intends not to use or to use in a way that is different from the way other market participants would use them|\n|B43|To protect its competitive position, or for other reasons, the acquirer may intend not to use an acquired non-financial asset actively, or it may not intend to use the asset according to its highest and best use. For example, that might be the case for an acquired research and development intangible asset that the acquirer|",

In that situation, paragraph 33 requires the acquirer to determine the amount of goodwill by using the acquisition-date fair value of the acquiree\u2019s equity interests instead of the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer\u2019s equity interests transferred as consideration. In addition, the acquirer in a combination of mutual entities shall recognise the acquiree\u2019s net assets as a direct addition to capital or equity in its statement of financial position, not as an addition to retained earnings, which is consistent with the way in which other types of entities apply the acquisition method.|\n|---|---|\n|B48|Although they are similar in many ways to other businesses, mutual entities have distinct characteristics that arise primarily because their members are both customers and owners. Members of mutual entities generally expect to receive benefits for their membership, often in the form of reduced fees charged for goods and services or patronage dividends. The portion of patronage dividends allocated to each member is often based on the amount of business the member did with the mutual entity during the year.|\n|B49|A fair value measurement of a mutual entity should include the assumptions that market participants would make about future member benefits as well as any other relevant assumptions market participants would make about the mutual entity. For example, a present value technique may be used to measure the fair value of a mutual entity. The cash flows used as inputs to the model should be based on the expected cash flows of the mutual entity, which are likely to reflect reductions for member benefits, such as reduced fees charged for goods and services.|",

        "text": "# Determining what is part of the business combination transaction (application of paragraphs 51 and 52)\n\nB50 The acquirer should consider the following factors, which are neither mutually exclusive nor individually conclusive, to determine whether a transaction is part of the exchange for the acquiree or whether the transaction is separate from the business combination:\n\n|(a) the reasons for the transaction|Understanding the reasons why the parties to the combination (the acquirer and the acquiree and their owners, directors and managers\u2014and their agents) entered into a particular transaction or arrangement may provide insight into whether it is part of the consideration transferred and the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. For example, if a transaction is arranged primarily for the benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity rather than primarily for the benefit of the acquiree or its former owners before the combination, that portion of the transaction price paid (and any related assets or liabilities) is less likely to be part of the exchange for the acquiree. Accordingly, the acquirer would account for that portion separately from the business combination.|\n|---|---|\n|(b) who initiated the transaction|Understanding who initiated the transaction may also provide insight into whether it is part of the exchange for the acquiree. For example, a transaction or other event that is initiated by the acquirer may be entered into for the purpose of providing future economic benefits to the acquirer or combined entity with little or no benefit received by the acquiree or its former owners before the combination. On the other hand, a transaction or arrangement initiated by the acquiree or its former owners is less likely to be for the benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity and more likely to be part of the business combination transaction.|\n|(c) the timing of the transaction|The timing of the transaction may also provide insight into whether it is part of the exchange for the acquiree. For example, a transaction between the acquirer and the acquiree that takes place during the negotiations of the terms of a business combination may have been entered into in contemplation of the business combination to provide future economic benefits to the acquirer or the combined entity. If so, the acquiree or its former owners before the business combination are likely to receive little or no benefit from the transaction except for benefits they receive as part of the combined entity.|\n\nEffective settlement of a pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and acquiree in a business combination (application of paragraph 52(a))\n\nB51 The acquirer and acquiree may have a relationship that existed before they contemplated the business combination, referred to here as a \u2018pre-existing relationship\u2019. A pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and acquiree may be contractual (for example, vendor and customer or licensor and licensee) or non-contractual (for example, plaintiff and defendant).\n\nB52 If the business combination in effect settles a pre-existing relationship, the acquirer recognises a gain or loss, measured as follows:\n\n|(a) for a pre-existing non-contractual relationship (such as a lawsuit)|fair value.|\n|---|---|\n|(b) for a pre-existing contractual relationship, the lesser of (i) and (ii):|(i) the amount by which the contract is favourable or unfavourable from the perspective of the acquirer when compared with terms for current market transactions for the same or similar items. (An unfavourable contract is a contract that is unfavourable in terms of current market terms. It is not necessarily an onerous contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.)|\n| |(ii) the amount of any stated settlement provisions in the contract available to the counterparty to whom the contract is unfavourable. If (ii) is less than (i), the difference is included as part of the business combination accounting. The amount of gain or loss recognised may depend in part on whether the acquirer had previously recognised a related asset or liability, and the reported gain or loss therefore may differ from the amount calculated by applying the above requirements.|\n\nB53 A pre-existing relationship may be a contract that the acquirer recognises as a reacquired right.

Understanding the reasons why the acquisition agreement includes a provision for contingent payments, who initiated the arrangement and when the parties entered into the arrangement may be helpful in assessing the nature of the arrangement.|\n|---|---|\n|B55|If it is not clear whether an arrangement for payments to employees or selling shareholders is part of the exchange for the acquiree or is a transaction separate from the business combination, the acquirer should consider the following indicators:|\n| |(a) Continuing employment\u2014The terms of continuing employment by the selling shareholders who become key employees may be an indicator of the substance of a contingent consideration arrangement. The relevant terms of continuing employment may be included in an employment agreement, acquisition agreement or some other document. A contingent consideration arrangement in which the payments are automatically forfeited if employment terminates is remuneration for post-combination services. Arrangements in which the contingent payments are not affected by employment termination may indicate that the contingent payments are additional consideration rather than remuneration.|\n| |(b) Duration of continuing employment\u2014If the period of required employment coincides with or is longer than the contingent payment period, that fact may indicate that the contingent payments are, in substance, remuneration.|\n| |(c) Level of remuneration\u2014Situations in which employee remuneration other than the contingent payments is at a reasonable level in comparison with that of other key employees in the combined entity may indicate that the contingent payments are additional consideration rather than remuneration.|\n| |(d) Incremental payments to employees\u2014If selling shareholders who do not become employees receive lower contingent payments on a per-share basis than the selling shareholders who become employees of the combined entity, that fact may indicate that the incremental amount of contingent payments to the selling shareholders who become employees is remuneration.|\n| |(e) Number of shares owned\u2014The relative number of shares owned by the selling shareholders who remain as key employees may be an indicator of the substance of the contingent consideration arrangement. For example, if the selling shareholders who owned substantially all of the shares in the acquiree continue as key employees, that fact may indicate that the arrangement is, in substance, a profit-sharing arrangement intended to provide remuneration for post-combination services. Alternatively, if selling shareholders who continue as key employees owned only a small number of shares of the acquiree and all selling shareholders receive the same amount of contingent consideration on a per-share basis, that fact may indicate that the contingent payments are additional consideration. The pre-acquisition ownership interests held by parties related to selling shareholders who continue as key employees, such as family members, should also be considered.|\n| |(f) Linkage to the valuation\u2014If the initial consideration transferred at the acquisition date is based on the low end of a range established in the valuation of the acquiree and the contingent formula relates to that valuation approach, that fact may suggest that the contingent payments are additional consideration. Alternatively, if the contingent payment formula is consistent with prior profit-sharing arrangements, that fact may suggest that the substance of the arrangement is to provide remuneration.|\n| |(g) Formula for determining consideration\u2014The formula used to determine the contingent payment may be helpful in assessing the substance of the arrangement. For example, if a contingent payment is determined on the basis of a multiple of earnings, that might suggest that the obligation is contingent consideration in the business combination and that the formula is intended to establish or verify the fair value of the acquiree. In contrast, a contingent payment that is a specified percentage of earnings might suggest that the obligation to employees is a profit-sharing arrangement to remunerate employees for services rendered.|",

        "text": "# (h) Other agreements and issues\n\nThe terms of other arrangements with selling shareholders (such as agreements not to compete, executory contracts, consulting contracts and property lease agreements) and the income tax treatment of contingent payments may indicate that contingent payments are attributable to something other than consideration for the acquiree. For example, in connection with the acquisition, the acquirer might enter into a property lease arrangement with a significant selling shareholder. If the lease payments specified in the lease contract are significantly below market, some or all of the contingent payments to the lessor (the selling shareholder) required by a separate arrangement for contingent payments might be, in substance, payments for the use of the leased property that the acquirer should recognise separately in its post-combination financial statements. In contrast, if the lease contract specifies lease payments that are consistent with market terms for the leased property, the arrangement for contingent payments to the selling shareholder may be contingent consideration in the business combination.\n\n# Acquirer share-based payment awards exchanged for awards held by the acquiree\u2019s employees (application of paragraph 52(b))\n\n|B56|An acquirer may exchange its share-based payment awards (replacement awards) for awards held by employees of the acquiree. Exchanges of share options or other share-based payment awards in conjunction with a business combination are accounted for as modifications of share-based payment awards in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based Payment. If the acquirer replaces the acquiree awards, either all or a portion of the market-based measure of the acquirer\u2019s replacement awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. Paragraphs B57\u2013B62 provide guidance on how to allocate the market-based measure. However, in situations in which acquiree awards would expire as a consequence of a business combination and if the acquirer replaces those awards when it is not obliged to do so, all of the market-based measure of the replacement awards shall be recognised as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements in accordance with AASB 2. That is to say, none of the market-based measure of those awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. The acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree awards if the acquiree or its employees have the ability to enforce replacement. For example, for the purposes of applying this guidance, the acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree\u2019s awards if replacement is required by:|\n|---|---|\n| |(a) the terms of the acquisition agreement;|\n| |(b) the terms of the acquiree\u2019s awards; or|\n| |(c) applicable laws or regulations.|\n\nB57 To determine the portion of a replacement award that is part of the consideration transferred for the acquiree and the portion that is remuneration for post-combination service, the acquirer shall measure both the replacement awards granted by the acquirer and the acquiree awards as of the acquisition date in accordance with AASB 2. The portion of the market-based measure of the replacement award that is part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree equals the portion of the acquiree award that is attributable to pre-combination service.\n\nB58 The portion of the replacement award attributable to pre-combination service is the market-based measure of the acquiree award multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period or the original vesting period of the acquiree award. The vesting period is the period during which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. Vesting conditions are defined in AASB 2.\n\nB59 The portion of a non-vested replacement award attributable to post-combination service, and therefore recognised as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements, equals the total market-based measure of the replacement award less the amount attributed to pre-combination service. Therefore, the acquirer attributes any excess of the market-based measure of the replacement award over the market-based measure of the acquiree award to post-combination service and recognises that excess as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements. The acquirer shall attribute a portion of a replacement award to post-combination service if it requires post-combination service, regardless of whether employees had rendered all of the service required for their acquiree awards to vest before the acquisition date.\n\nB60 The portion of a non-vested replacement award attributable to pre-combination service, as well as the portion attributable to post-combination service, shall reflect the best available estimate of the number of replacement awards expected to vest. For example, if the market-based measure of the portion of a replacement award attributed to pre-combination service is CU100 and the acquirer expects that only 95 per cent of the award will vest, the amount included in consideration transferred in the business combination is CU95. Changes in the estimated number of replacement awards expected to vest are reflected in\n\n1 In paragraphs B56\u2013B62 the term \u2018share-based payment awards\u2019 refers to vested or unvested share-based payment transactions.",

        "text": "# Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2008-11\n\nThis Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 3. The Basis for Conclusions was originally published with AASB 2008-11 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standard \u2013 Business Combinations Among Not-for-Profit Entities.\n\n# Background\n\nBC1 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (AASB) decisions in reaching the conclusions in this Standard. Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.\n\n# Significant Issues\n\nBC2 The AASB issued a revised AASB 3 Business Combinations in March 2008. At that time, the Board decided that the requirements of AASB 3 (March 2008) should only be available for early adoption by for-profit entities, until further work was undertaken on the implications of applying the requirements of AASB 3 (March 2008) to not-for-profit entities. Accordingly, the Board included in the Preface to AASB 3 (March 2008) the following statement:\n\nPrior to the mandatory application date of this Standard, being 1 July 2009, the AASB will consider its suitability for combinations among not-for-profit entities. In doing so, the AASB will have regard to the criteria being developed for judging when IFRSs should be modified for application by not-for-profit entities. Those criteria will assist in clarifying whether this Standard should be amended to include an additional scope exclusion or other amendments and, if so, the extent of that exclusion or other amendments in an Australian not-for-profit context. In light of this, not-for-profit entities cannot adopt this Standard prior to the mandatory application date.\n\nBC3 As part of its subsequent deliberations, the Board noted the view of some that the difficulties in applying the acquisition method when a business combination does not involve consideration (including the difficulties of identifying an acquirer), which is often the case in business combinations among not-for-profit entities, means that the principles in AASB 3 (March 2008) are inappropriate for such combinations. However, the Board decided that, in principle, there is no conceptual basis for accounting for business combinations among not-for-profit entities differently from other analogous types of business combinations.\n\nBC4 In particular, the Board noted that the types of difficulties noted in paragraph BC3 are also issues that may be encountered in business combinations of for-profit entities (such as combinations by contract alone). Therefore, consistent with transaction-neutral principles, the Board did not consider that there was sufficient reason to justify a different accounting treatment for business combinations among not-for-profit entities.\n\nBC5 The Board observed that the motivations for business combinations among not-for-profit entities, such as to provide their beneficiaries with a broader range of, or access to, services and cost savings through economies of scale, are similar to those for business combinations among other entities. The Board noted a possible alternative to the acquisition method in AASB 3 for business combinations among not-for-profit entities might be the \u2018fresh start\u2019 method, especially where it is difficult to identify the acquirer. The fresh start method assumes that none of the combining entities survives the business combination as an independent reporting entity. Rather, the business combination is viewed as a transfer of the net assets of the combining entities to a new entity that assumes control over them. The Board noted the potential significant costs and practical difficulties that a fresh start alternative would impose, and therefore concluded that the potential advantages of using the fresh start method for some business combinations among not-for-profit entities would be outweighed by the disadvantages.\n\nBC6 However, the Board noted that the accounting for business combinations may differ depending on whether entities, such as local governments or universities, are commonly controlled. In that regard, the Board confirmed that further work should be undertaken on its longer-term \u2018control in the public sector\u2019 project, which should include consideration of whether local governments or universities within a jurisdiction are subject to common control.\n\nBC7 In the interim, the Board decided to maintain the status quo in respect of accounting for restructures of local governments by substantially incorporating the requirements originally transferred from AAS 27 Financial Reporting by Local Governments to superseded AASB 3 (as amended in December 2007 by AASB 2007-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Review of AASs 27, 29 and 31) into AASB 3.",

In making its decision, the Board considered the work undertaken to date on Invitation to Comment ITC 14 Not-for-Profit Entity Definition and Guidance, which sought input on using the definition and guidance from NZ IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements in Australia. The Board suspended further work on ITC 14 until the development of guidelines that can be used for modifying IFRSs for application by not-for-profit entities. In light of this, the Board decided that no further changes should be made to AASB 3 (March 2008, as amended) in respect of not-for-profit entities.",
