An interest in another entity can be evidenced by, but\nis not limited to, the holding of equity or debt instruments as well as other forms of\ninvolvement such as the provision of funding, liquidity support, credit enhancement\nand guarantees. It includes the means by which an entity has control or joint control\nof, or significant influence over, another entity. An entity does not necessarily have an\ninterest in another entity solely because of a typical customer supplier relationship.  \nParagraphs B7\u2013B9 provide further information about interests in other entities.  \nParagraphs B55\u2013B57 of AASB 10 explain variability of returns.  \n**structured entity** An entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant\nfactor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to\nadministrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of\ncontractual arrangements.  \nParagraphs B22\u2013B24 provide further information about structured entities.  \nThe following terms are defined in AASB 127, AASB 128, AASB 10 and AASB 11 Joint Arrangements and are used\nin this Standard with the meanings specified in those Standards:  \n-  associate  \n-  consolidated financial statements  \n-  control of an entity  \n-  equity method  \n-  group  \n-  investment entity  \n-  joint arrangement  \n-  joint control  \n-  joint operation  \n-  joint venture  \n-  non-controlling interest  \n-  parent  \n-  protective rights  \n-  relevant activities  \n-  separate financial statements  \n-  separate vehicle  \n-  significant influence  \n-  subsidiary.  \n-----  ",

Consideration of the\npurpose and design of the other entity may help the reporting entity when assessing whether it has an\ninterest in that entity and, therefore, whether it is required to provide the disclosures in this Standard. That\nassessment shall include consideration of the risks that the other entity was designed to create and the risks\nthe other entity was designed to pass on to the reporting entity and other parties.  \nB8 A reporting entity is typically exposed to variability of returns from the performance of another entity by\nholding instruments (such as equity or debt instruments issued by the other entity) or having another\ninvolvement that absorbs variability. For example, assume a structured entity holds a loan portfolio. The\nstructured entity obtains a credit default swap from another entity (the reporting entity) to protect itself from\nthe default of interest and principal payments on the loans. The reporting entity has involvement that  \n-----  exposes it to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entity because the credit default\nswap absorbs variability of returns of the structured entity.  \nB9 Some instruments are designed to transfer risk from a reporting entity to another entity. Such instruments\ncreate variability of returns for the other entity but do not typically expose the reporting entity to variability\nof returns from the performance of the other entity. For example, assume a structured entity is established to\nprovide investment opportunities for investors who wish to have exposure to entity Z\u2019s credit risk (entity Z\nis unrelated to any party involved in the arrangement). The structured entity obtains funding by issuing to\nthose investors notes that are linked to entity Z\u2019s credit risk (credit-linked notes) and uses the proceeds to\ninvest in a portfolio of risk-free financial assets. The structured entity obtains exposure to entity Z\u2019s credit\nrisk by entering into a credit default swap (CDS) with a swap counterparty. The CDS passes entity Z\u2019s\ncredit risk to the structured entity in return for a fee paid by the swap counterparty. The investors in the\nstructured entity receive a higher return that reflects both the structured entity\u2019s return from its asset\nportfolio and the CDS fee. The swap counterparty does not have involvement with the structured entity that\nexposes it to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entity because the CDS transfers\nvariability to the structured entity, rather than absorbing variability of returns of the structured entity.",

        "page_content=": "## Structured entities  \nIG3 A structured entity is defined in Appendix A of AASB 12 as follows:  \n\u201cAn entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in\ndeciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks\nonly and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\u201d  \nRelevant activities are defined in AASB 10 as the activities of an entity that significantly affect the entity\u2019s\nreturns. The current ability to direct the relevant activities is necessary in order for one entity to control\nanother.  \nIG4 Paragraph B22 of AASB 12 states that structured entities often have some or all of the following features or\nattributes: restricted activities, a narrow and well-defined objective, insufficient equity to finance its\nactivities without subordinated financial support, and financing tranches in the form of multiple\ncontractually linked instruments. Paragraph B23 gives examples of structured entities: securitisation\nvehicles, asset-backed financings and some investment funds.  \nIG5 The definition of a structured entity depends on voting or similar rights not being the dominant factor in\ndeciding who controls an entity. Voting rights are a common feature in many for-profit entities, having a\ndominant role in determining who controls an entity. Accordingly, the principle underlying the definition\nlimits the scope of structured entities to entities that are controlled through less conventional means. The\nfeatures listed in paragraph B22 and the examples in paragraph B23 also suggest that structured entities\nconstitute a limited class of entity.  \nIG6 It is common for not-for-profit entities to be established by administrative arrangements or legislation,\nespecially in the public sector. Therefore, if the administrative arrangements or legislation are dominant\nfactors in determining control of such an entity, the entity is not a structured entity. The AASB 12\ndisclosures regarding structured entities, such as the provision of financial support without a contractual\nobligation, are not particularly relevant to such entities, given the expectation of ongoing government\nfunding through appropriations to supplement any other revenue sources.  \nIG7 Applying the principle underlying the definition of a structured entity means that structured entities have\nbeen designed so that less conventional means \u2013 in the context of not-for-profit entities \u2013 are the dominant\nfactor in determining who controls the entity. This approach limits, for not-for-profit entities, the scope of\nstructured entities to entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights, including\nadministrative arrangements or statutory provisions, are not the dominant factor in determining control of\nthe entity.  \nIG8 To illustrate the definition of a structured entity, an entity for which contractual arrangements are significant\nto determining control of the entity is a structured entity. This would include entities for which most of the\nactivities are predetermined, with the relevant activities limited in scope but directed through contractual\narrangements. Examples of such entities are included in paragraph B23. Another example would be a\npartnership between a government and a private sector entity, being a partnership established and directed\nby contractual arrangements. On that basis, the partnership is a structured entity, regardless of the rights (if\nany) that the government and the entity have in relation to the partnership. If the government guarantees a  \n-----  certain level of revenue for its private sector partner, for example, the AASB 12 disclosures concerning the\nprovision of financial support would be particularly relevant, whether the partnership is a consolidated or an\nunconsolidated structured entity for the government. However, the mere fact that a government provides\nfunding to another entity does not make that entity a structured entity.  \nIG9 Not-for-profit private sector entities will also need to identify any structured entities with which they are\nassociated. For example, a not-for-profit private sector entity may have established or sponsored a\ncommunity service organisation whose relevant activities are directed by means of contractual\narrangements. Those arrangements might require the not-for-profit private sector entity to provide financial\nsupport in specified circumstances to the community service organisation, or alternatively the entity might\nchoose to provide financial or other support to the organisation without the contractual obligation to do so\n(eg due to the economic dependency of the organisation upon the entity). The AASB 12 disclosure\nrequirements would be relevant in both circumstances as the community service organisation is a structured\nentity. Paragraph 31, for example, would require the not-for-profit private sector entity to disclose any\ncurrent intentions to provide support to an unconsolidated structured entity.  \n-----  ",
