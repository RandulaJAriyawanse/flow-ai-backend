Statutory mechanisms can also create enforceable arrangements, either on their own or in\nconjunction with contracts between the parties.  \nB3 When joint arrangements are structured through a _separate vehicle (see paragraphs B19\u2013B33), the_\ncontractual arrangement, or some aspects of the contractual arrangement, will in some cases be incorporated\nin the articles, charter or by-laws of the separate vehicle.  \nB4 The contractual arrangement sets out the terms upon which the parties participate in the activity that is the\nsubject of the arrangement. The contractual arrangement generally deals with such matters as:  \n(a) the purpose, activity and duration of the joint arrangement.  \n(b) how the members of the board of directors, or equivalent governing body, of the joint\narrangement, are appointed.  \n(c) the decision-making process: the matters requiring decisions from the parties, the voting rights of\nthe parties and the required level of support for those matters. The decision-making process\nreflected in the contractual arrangement establishes joint control of the arrangement (see\nparagraphs B5\u2013B11).  \n(d) the capital or other contributions required of the parties.  \n(e) how the parties share assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses or profit or loss relating to the joint\narrangement.",

AASB 10 defines control and shall be used to\ndetermine whether all the parties, or a group of the parties, are exposed, or have rights, to variable returns\nfrom their involvement with the arrangement and have the ability to affect those returns through their power\nover the arrangement. When all the parties, or a group of the parties, considered collectively, are able to\ndirect the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement (ie the relevant activities), the\nparties control the arrangement collectively.  \nB6 After concluding that all the parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively, an entity\nshall assess whether it has joint control of the arrangement. Joint control exists only when decisions about\nthe relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement.\nAssessing whether the arrangement is jointly controlled by all of its parties or by a group of the parties, or\ncontrolled by one of its parties alone, can require judgement.  \nB7 Sometimes the decision-making process that is agreed upon by the parties in their contractual arrangement\nimplicitly leads to joint control.

In such cases, the\ncontractual arrangement establishes the parties\u2019 rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities,  \n-----  relating to the arrangement, and the parties\u2019 rights to the corresponding revenues and obligations for the\ncorresponding expenses.  \nB17 The contractual arrangement often describes the nature of the activities that are the subject of the\narrangement and how the parties intend to undertake those activities together. For example, the parties to a\njoint arrangement could agree to manufacture a product together, with each party being responsible for a\nspecific task and each using its own assets and incurring its own liabilities. The contractual arrangement\ncould also specify how the revenues and expenses that are common to the parties are to be shared among\nthem. In such a case, each joint operator recognises in its financial statements the assets and liabilities used\nfor the specific task, and recognises its share of the revenues and expenses in accordance with the\ncontractual arrangement.  \nB18 In other cases, the parties to a joint arrangement might agree, for example, to share and operate an asset\ntogether. In such a case, the contractual arrangement establishes the parties\u2019 rights to the asset that is\noperated jointly, and how output or revenue from the asset and operating costs are shared among the parties.\nEach joint operator accounts for its share of the joint asset and its agreed share of any liabilities, and\nrecognises its share of the output, revenues and expenses in accordance with the contractual arrangement.  \n_Joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle_  \nB19 A joint arrangement in which the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement are held in a separate\nvehicle can be either a joint venture or a joint operation.  \nB20 Whether a party is a joint operator or a joint venturer depends on the party\u2019s rights to the assets, and\nobligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement that are held in the separate vehicle.  \nB21 As stated in paragraph B15, when the parties have structured a joint arrangement in a separate vehicle, the\nparties need to assess whether the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual\narrangement and, when relevant, any other facts and circumstances give them:  \n(a) rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement (ie the\narrangement is a joint operation); or  \n(b) rights to the net assets of the arrangement (ie the arrangement is a joint venture).",

The manufacturing arrangement is structured\nin a separate vehicle (entity M) whose legal form causes it to be considered in its own right (ie the\nassets and liabilities held in entity M are the assets and liabilities of entity M and not the assets\nand liabilities of the parties). In accordance with the framework agreement, the parties have\ncommitted themselves to purchasing the whole production of product P manufactured by the\nmanufacturing arrangement in accordance with their ownership interests in entity M. The parties\nsubsequently sell product P to another arrangement, jointly controlled by the two parties\nthemselves, that has been established exclusively for the distribution of product P as described\nbelow. Neither the framework agreement nor the contractual arrangement between A and B\ndealing with the manufacturing activity specifies that the parties have rights to the assets, and\nobligations for the liabilities, relating to the manufacturing activity.  \n(b) Distribution activity: the parties have agreed to undertake the distribution activity through a joint\narrangement (the distribution arrangement).

In accordance with the framework agreement, the\ndistribution arrangement orders its requirements for product P from the parties according to the\nneeds of the different markets where the distribution arrangement sells the product. Neither the\nframework agreement nor the contractual arrangement between A and B dealing with the  \n-----  distribution activity specifies that the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the\nliabilities, relating to the distribution activity.  \nIE16 In addition, the framework agreement establishes:  \n(a) that the manufacturing arrangement will produce product P to meet the requirements for product\nP that the distribution arrangement places on the parties;  \n(b) the commercial terms relating to the sale of product P by the manufacturing arrangement to the\nparties. The manufacturing arrangement will sell product P to the parties at a price agreed by A\nand B that covers all production costs incurred. Subsequently, the parties sell the product to the\ndistribution arrangement at a price agreed by A and B.  \n(c) that any cash shortages that the manufacturing arrangement may incur will be financed by the\nparties in accordance with their ownership interests in entity M.",

In addition, neither the framework agreement nor the contractual\narrangement dealing with the manufacturing activity specifies that the parties have rights to the assets, and\nobligations for the liabilities, relating to the manufacturing activity. However, when considering the\nfollowing facts and circumstances the parties have concluded that the manufacturing arrangement is a joint\noperation:  \n(a) The parties have committed themselves to purchasing the whole production of product P\nmanufactured by the manufacturing arrangement. Consequently, A and B have rights to\nsubstantially all the economic benefits of the assets of the manufacturing arrangement.  \n(b) The manufacturing arrangement manufactures product P to meet the quantity and quality needs of\nthe parties so that they can fulfil the demand for product P of the distribution arrangement. The\nexclusive dependence of the manufacturing arrangement upon the parties for the generation of\ncash flows and the parties\u2019 commitments to provide funds when the manufacturing arrangement\nincurs any cash shortages indicate that the parties have an obligation for the liabilities of the\nmanufacturing arrangement, because those liabilities will be settled through the parties\u2019 purchases\nof product P or by the parties\u2019 direct provision of funds.  \nIE19 The parties carry out the distribution activities through entity D, whose legal form confers separation\nbetween the parties and the entity. In addition, neither the framework agreement nor the contractual\narrangement dealing with the distribution activity specifies that the parties have rights to the assets, and\nobligations for the liabilities, relating to the distribution activity.  \nIE20 There are no other facts and circumstances that indicate that the parties have rights to substantially all the\neconomic benefits of the assets relating to the distribution arrangement or that the parties have an obligation\nfor the liabilities relating to that arrangement.

Each party also\nrecognises its share of the expenses resulting from the manufacture of product P incurred by the\nmanufacturing arrangement and its share of the revenues relating to the sales of product P to the distribution\narrangement.  \nIE22 The parties recognise their rights to the net assets of the distribution arrangement as investments and\naccount for them using the equity method.",

The lending syndicate agrees that it will not\nhave recourse to companies A and B once the LNG facility is in production because it has assessed that the\ncash inflows that entity C should generate from LNG sales will be sufficient to meet the loan repayments.\nAlthough at this time the lenders have no recourse to companies A and B, the syndicate maintains\nprotection against default by entity C by taking a lien on the LNG facility.",

However, processing Material M requires specialist knowhow and thus far, Material M has only been used in the production of cosmetics.  \nIE66 In order to get access to existing know-how in processing Material M, Companies A and B arrange for\nCompany C to join as another joint operator by acquiring an interest in Joint Operation Z from Companies\nA and B and becoming a party to the contractual arrangements.  \nIE67 Company C\u2019s business so far has been solely the development and production of cosmetics. It has longstanding and extensive knowledge in processing Material M.  \nIE68 In exchange for its share in Joint Operation Z, Company C pays cash to Companies A and B and grants the\nright to use its know-how in processing Material M for the purposes of Joint Operation Z. In addition,\nCompany C seconds some of its employees who are experienced in processing Material M to Joint\nOperation Z. However, Company C does not transfer control of the know-how to Companies A and B or\nJoint Operation Z because it retains all the rights to it. In particular, Company C is entitled to withdraw the\nright to use its know-how in processing Material M and to withdraw its seconded employees without any\nrestrictions or compensation to Companies A and B or Joint Operation Z if it ceases its participation in Joint\nOperation Z.  \nIE69 The fair value of Company C\u2019s know-how on the date of the acquisition of the interest in the joint operation\nis CU1,000. Immediately before the acquisition, the carrying amount of the know-how in the financial\nstatements of Company C was CU300.",

        "page_content=": "## Analysis  \nIE70 Company C has acquired an interest in Joint Operation Z in which the activity of the joint operation\nconstitutes a business, as defined in AASB 3.  \nIE71 In accounting for the acquisition of its interest in the joint operation, Company C applies all the principles\non business combinations accounting in AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards that do not\nconflict with the guidance in this Standard (see paragraph 21A). Company C therefore recognises in its\nfinancial statements its share of the assets and liabilities resulting from the contractual arrangement (see\nparagraph 20).  \nIE72 Company C granted the right to use its know-how in processing Material M to Joint Operation Z as part of\njoining Joint Operation Z as a joint operator. However, Company C retains control of this right because it is\nentitled to withdraw the right to use its know-how in processing Material M and to withdraw its seconded  \n-----  employees without any restrictions or any compensation to Companies A and B or Joint Operation Z if it\nceases its participation in Joint Operation Z.  \nIE73 Consequently, Company C continues to recognise the know-how in processing Material M after the\nacquisition of the interest in Joint Operation Z because it retains all the rights to it. This means that\nCompany C will continue to recognise the know-how based on its carrying amount of CU300. As a\nconsequence of retaining control of the right to use the know-how that it granted to the joint operation,\nCompany C has granted the right to use the know-how to itself. Consequently, Company C does not\nremeasure the know-how, and it does not recognise a gain or loss on the grant of the right to use it.  \n-----  ",
