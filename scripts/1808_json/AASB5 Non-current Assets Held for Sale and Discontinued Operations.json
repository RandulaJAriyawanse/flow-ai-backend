However, if a government were to\ndiscontinue an activity that one of its departments had disclosed as an administered activity, from\nthe point of view of that government the discontinuance may constitute a discontinued operation.  \nAus2.4 Although AASB 3 Business Combinations contains requirements relating to the restructuring of\nlocal governments, these requirements only apply to the local government receiving assets or\nliabilities as a result of the restructuring. This Standard applies to the local government\ntransferring assets and liabilities where the restructuring results in a discontinued operation of the\ntransferor local government.  \n3 Assets classified as non-current in accordance with AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements shall\nnot be reclassified as current assets until they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance\nwith this Standard. Assets of a class that an entity would normally regard as non-current that are acquired\nexclusively with a view to resale shall not be classified as current unless they meet the criteria to be\nclassified as held for sale in accordance with this Standard.  \n1 For assets classified according to a liquidity presentation, non-current assets are assets that include amounts expected to be recovered\nmore than twelve months after the reporting period. Paragraph 3 applies to the classification of such assets.  \n-----  4 Sometimes an entity disposes of a group of assets, possibly with some directly associated liabilities,\ntogether in a single transaction. Such a disposal group may be a group of _cash-generating units, a single_\ncash-generating unit, or part of a cash-generating unit.[2] The group may include any assets and any\nliabilities of the entity, including current assets, current liabilities and assets excluded by paragraph 5 from\nthe measurement requirements of this Standard. If a non-current asset within the scope of the measurement\nrequirements of this Standard is part of a disposal group, the measurement requirements of this Standard\napply to the group as a whole, so that the group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair\nvalue less costs to sell. The requirements for measuring the individual assets and liabilities within the\ndisposal group are set out in paragraphs 18, 19 and 23.  \n5 The measurement provisions of this Standard[3] do not apply to the following assets, which are covered by\nthe Australian Accounting Standards listed, either as individual assets or as part of a disposal group:  \n(a) deferred tax assets (AASB 112 Income Taxes).  \n(b) assets arising from employee benefits (AASB 119 Employee Benefits).  \n(c) financial assets within the scope of AASB 9 Financial Instruments.  \n(d) non-current assets that are accounted for in accordance with the fair value model in AASB 140\n_Investment Property._  \n(e) non-current assets that are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with AASB 141\n_Agriculture._  \n(f) groups of contracts within the scope of AASB 17 Insurance Contracts.  \nAus5.1 Further to paragraph 5, for public sector entities, the measurement provisions of this Standard[3] do\nnot apply to contractual rights under insurance contracts as defined in AASB 4 Insurance\n_Contracts._  \n5A The classification, presentation and measurement requirements in this Standard applicable to a non-current\nasset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for sale apply also to a non-current asset (or disposal\ngroup) that is classified as held for distribution to owners acting in their capacity as owners (held for\ndistribution to owners).  \n5B This Standard specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups)\nclassified as held for sale or discontinued operations. Disclosures in other Standards do not apply to such\nassets (or disposal groups) unless those Standards require:  \n(a) specific disclosures in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale\nor discontinued operations; or  \n(b) disclosures about measurement of assets and liabilities within a disposal group that are not within\nthe scope of the measurement requirement of AASB 5 and such disclosures are not already\nprovided in the other notes to the financial statements.  \nAdditional disclosures about non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or\ndiscontinued operations may be necessary to comply with the general requirements of AASB 101, in\nparticular paragraphs 15 and 125 of that Standard.",

Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is  \n2 However, once the cash flows from an asset or group of assets are expected to arise principally from sale rather than continuing use,\nthey become less dependent on cash flows arising from other assets, and a disposal group that was part of a cash-generating unit\nbecomes a separate cash-generating unit.  \n3 Other than paragraphs 18 and 19, which require the assets in question to be measured in accordance with other applicable Australian\nAccounting Standards.  \n-----  reasonable in relation to its current fair value. In addition, the sale should be expected to qualify for\nrecognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, except as permitted by\nparagraph 9, and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant\nchanges to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders\u2019\napproval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the sale\nis highly probable.  \n8A An entity that is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary shall classify all the assets\nand liabilities of that subsidiary as held for sale when the criteria set out in paragraphs 6\u20138 are met,\nregardless of whether the entity will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.  \n9 Events or circumstances may extend the period to complete the sale beyond one year. An extension of the\nperiod required to complete a sale does not preclude an asset (or disposal group) from being classified as\nheld for sale if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the entity\u2019s control and there is\nsufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset (or disposal group). This\nwill be the case when the criteria in Appendix B are met.  \n10 Sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange\nhas commercial substance in accordance with AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment.  \n11 When an entity acquires a non-current asset (or disposal group) exclusively with a view to its subsequent\ndisposal, it shall classify the non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale at the acquisition date\nonly if the one-year requirement in paragraph 8 is met (except as permitted by paragraph 9) and it is highly\nprobable that any other criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 that are not met at that date will be met within a short\nperiod following the acquisition (usually within three months).  \n12 If the criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 are met after the reporting period, an entity shall not classify a noncurrent asset (or disposal group) as held for sale in those financial statements when issued. However, when\nthose criteria are met after the reporting period but before the authorisation of the financial statements for\nissue, the entity shall disclose the information specified in paragraph 41(a), (b) and (d) in the notes.  \n12A A non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for distribution to owners when the entity is\ncommitted to distribute the asset (or disposal group) to the owners. For this to be the case, the assets must\nbe available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution must be highly\nprobable. For the distribution to be highly probable, actions to complete the distribution must have been\ninitiated and should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Actions\nrequired to complete the distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the\ndistribution will be made or that the distribution will be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders\u2019\napproval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the\ndistribution is highly probable.",

The entity shall\napply the classification, presentation and measurement requirements in this Standard that are\napplicable to the new method of disposal.  \n(b) shall measure the non-current asset (or disposal group) by following the requirements in\nparagraph 15 (if reclassified as held for sale) or 15A (if reclassified as held for distribution to\nowners) and recognise any reduction or increase in the fair value less costs to sell/costs to\ndistribute of the non-current asset (or disposal group) by following the requirements in\nparagraphs 20\u201325.  \n(c) shall not change the date of classification in accordance with paragraphs 8 and 12A. This does not\npreclude an extension of the period required to complete a sale or a distribution to owners if the\nconditions in paragraph 9 are met.  \n27 The entity shall measure a non-current asset (or disposal group) that ceases to be classified as held for sale\nor as held for distribution to owners (or ceases to be included in a disposal group classified as held for sale\nor as held for distribution to owners) at the lower of:  \n(a) its carrying amount before the asset (or disposal group) was classified as held for sale or as held\nfor distribution to owners, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations that would\nhave been recognised had the asset (or disposal group) not been classified as held for sale or as\nheld for distribution to owners, and  \n(b) its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell or distribute.[5]  \n28 The entity shall include any required adjustment to the carrying amount of a non-current asset that ceases to\nbe classified as held for sale or as held for distribution to owners in profit or loss[6] from continuing\noperations in the period in which the criteria in paragraphs 7\u20139 or 12A, respectively, are no longer met.\nFinancial statements for the periods since classification as held for sale or as held for distribution to owners\nshall be amended accordingly if the disposal group or non-current asset that ceases to be classified as held\nfor sale or as held for distribution to owners is a subsidiary, joint operation, joint venture, associate, or a\nportion of an interest in a joint venture or an associate. The entity shall present that adjustment in the same\ncaption in the statement of comprehensive income used to present a gain or loss, if any, recognised in\naccordance with paragraph 37.  \n29 If an entity removes an individual asset or liability from a disposal group classified as held for sale, the\nremaining assets and liabilities of the disposal group to be sold shall continue to be measured as a group\nonly if the group meets the criteria in paragraphs 7\u20139. If an entity removes an individual asset or liability\nfrom a disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners, the remaining assets and liabilities of the\ndisposal group to be distributed shall continue to be measured as a group only if the group meets the criteria\nin paragraph 12A. Otherwise, the remaining non-current assets of the group that individually meet the\ncriteria to be classified as held for sale (or as held for distribution to owners) shall be measured individually\nat the lower of their carrying amounts and fair values less costs to sell (or costs to distribute) at that date.\nAny non-current assets that do not meet the criteria for held for sale shall cease to be classified as held for\nsale in accordance with paragraph 26. Any non-current assets that do not meet the criteria for held for\ndistribution to owners shall cease to be classified as held for distribution to owners in accordance with\nparagraph 26.",
