Financial\nstatements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards are an entity\u2019s first Australian-AccountingStandards financial statements if, for example, the entity:  \n(a) presented its most recent previous financial statements:  \n(i) in accordance with national requirements that are not consistent with Australian\nAccounting Standards or _International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in all_\nrespects;  \n(ii) in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs in all respects, except\nthat the financial statements did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement that\nthey complied with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs;  \n(iii) containing an explicit statement of compliance with some, but not all, Australian\nAccounting Standards or IFRSs;  \n(iv) in accordance with national requirements inconsistent with Australian Accounting\nStandards or IFRSs, using some individual Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs\nto account for items for which national requirements did not exist; or  \n1 [Aus] The term \u2018Australian Accounting Standards\u2019 refers to Standards (including Interpretations) made by the AASB that apply to any  \nreporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2005.

In these_\ncases, the conditions specified in paragraph 3 for the application of this Standard are taken to be\nsatisfied provided the entity:  \n(a) discloses in its first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements:  \n(i) an explanation of information deficiencies and its strategy for rectifying\nthose deficiencies; and  \n(ii) the Australian Accounting Standards that have not been complied with; and  \n(b) makes an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with other Australian\nAccounting Standards for which there are no information deficiencies.  \n4 This Standard applies when an entity first adopts Australian Accounting Standards. It does not apply when,\nfor example, an entity:  \n(a) stops presenting financial statements in accordance with national requirements, having previously\npresented them as well as another set of financial statements that contained an explicit and\nunreserved statement of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs;  \n(b) presented financial statements in the previous year in accordance with national requirements and\nthose financial statements contained an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with\nAustralian Accounting Standards or IFRSs; or  \n(c) presented financial statements in the previous year that contained an explicit and unreserved\nstatement of compliance with Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs, even if the auditors\nqualified their audit report on those financial statements.  \n4A Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs 2 and 3, an entity that has applied Australian Accounting\nStandards or IFRSs in a previous reporting period, but whose most recent previous annual financial\nstatements did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with Australian Accounting\nStandards or IFRSs, must either apply this Standard or else apply Australian Accounting Standards\nretrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and\n_Errors as if the entity had never stopped applying Australian Accounting Standards or IFRSs._  \n4B When an entity does not elect to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph 4A, the entity shall\nnevertheless apply the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 23A\u201323B of AASB 1, in addition to the\ndisclosure requirements in AASB 108.  \n5 This Standard does not apply to changes in accounting policies made by an entity that already applies\nAustralian Accounting Standards. Such changes are the subject of:  \n(a) requirements on changes in accounting policies in AASB 108 _Accounting Policies, Changes in_\n_Accounting Estimates and Errors; and_  \n(b) specific transitional requirements in other Australian Accounting Standards.  \n-----  ",

An entity shall apply the following requirements to business_\n_combinations that the entity recognised before the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards. This_\n_Appendix should only be applied to business combinations within the scope of AASB 3 Business Combinations._  \nC1 A first-time adopter may elect not to apply AASB 3 retrospectively to past business combinations (business\ncombinations that occurred before the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards). However, if a\nfirst-time adopter restates any business combination to comply with AASB 3, it shall restate all later\nbusiness combinations and shall also apply AASB 10 from that same date. For example, if a first-time\nadopter elects to restate a business combination that occurred on 30 June 20X6, it shall restate all business\ncombinations that occurred between 30 June 20X6 and the date of transition to Australian Accounting\nStandards, and it shall also apply AASB 10 from 30 June 20X6.  \nC2 An entity need not apply AASB 121 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates retrospectively to\nfair value adjustments and goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the date of\ntransition to Australian Accounting Standards. If the entity does not apply AASB 121 retrospectively to\nthose fair value adjustments and goodwill, it shall treat them as assets and liabilities of the entity rather than\nas assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Therefore, those goodwill and fair value adjustments either are\nalready expressed in the entity\u2019s functional currency or are non-monetary foreign currency items, which are\nreported using the exchange rate applied in accordance with previous GAAP.  \nC3 An entity may apply AASB 121 retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill arising in either:  \n(a) all business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to Australian Accounting\nStandards; or  \n(b) all business combinations that the entity elects to restate to comply with AASB 3, as permitted by\nparagraph C1 above.  \nC4 If a first-time adopter does not apply AASB 3 retrospectively to a past business combination, this has the\nfollowing consequences for that business combination:  \n(a) The first-time adopter shall keep the same classification (as an acquisition by the legal acquirer, a\nreverse acquisition by the legal acquiree, or a uniting of interests) as in its previous GAAP\nfinancial statements.  \n(b) The first-time adopter shall recognise all its assets and liabilities at the date of transition to\nAustralian Accounting Standards that were acquired or assumed in a past business combination,\nother than:  \n(i) some financial assets and financial liabilities derecognised in accordance with previous\nGAAP (see paragraph B2); and  \n(ii) assets, including goodwill, and liabilities that were not recognised in the acquirer\u2019s\nconsolidated statement of financial position in accordance with previous GAAP and\nalso would not qualify for recognition in accordance with Australian Accounting\nStandards in the separate statement of financial position of the acquiree (see (f)\u2013(i)\nbelow).  \nThe first-time adopter shall recognise any resulting change by adjusting retained earnings (or, if\nappropriate, another category of equity), unless the change results from the recognition of an\nintangible asset that was previously subsumed within goodwill (see (g)(i) below).  \n(c) The first-time adopter shall exclude from its opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement\nof financial position any item recognised in accordance with previous GAAP that does not qualify\nfor recognition as an asset or liability under Australian Accounting Standards. The first-time\nadopter shall account for the resulting change as follows:  \n(i) the first-time adopter may have classified a past business combination as an acquisition\nand recognised as an intangible asset an item that does not qualify for recognition as an\nasset in accordance with AASB 138 Intangible Assets. It shall reclassify that item (and,\nif any, the related deferred tax and non-controlling interests) as part of goodwill (unless\nit deducted goodwill directly from equity in accordance with previous GAAP, see (g)(i)\nand (i) below).  \n-----  (ii) the first-time adopter shall recognise all other resulting changes in retained earnings.[2]  \n(d) Australian Accounting Standards require subsequent measurement of some assets and liabilities\non a basis that is not based on original cost, such as fair value. The first-time adopter shall\nmeasure these assets and liabilities on that basis in its opening Australian-Accounting-Standards\nstatement of financial position, even if they were acquired or assumed in a past business\ncombination. It shall recognise any resulting change in the carrying amount by adjusting retained\nearnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity), rather than goodwill.  \n(e) Immediately after the business combination, the carrying amount in accordance with previous\nGAAP of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in that business combination shall be their\ndeemed cost in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards at that date. If Australian\nAccounting Standards require a cost-based measurement of those assets and liabilities at a later\ndate, that deemed cost shall be the basis for cost-based depreciation or amortisation from the date\nof the business combination.  \n(f) If an asset acquired, or liability assumed, in a past business combination was not recognised in\naccordance with previous GAAP, it does not have a deemed cost of zero in the opening\nAustralian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position. Instead, the acquirer shall\nrecognise and measure it in its consolidated statement of financial position on the basis that\nAustralian Accounting Standards would require in the statement of financial position of the\nacquiree. To illustrate: if the acquirer had not, in accordance with its previous GAAP, capitalised\nleases acquired in a past business combination in which the acquiree was a lessee, it shall\ncapitalise those leases in its consolidated financial statements, as AASB 16 Leases would require\nthe acquiree to do in its Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position.\nSimilarly, if the acquirer had not, in accordance with its previous GAAP, recognised a contingent\nliability that still exists at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards, the acquirer\nshall recognise that contingent liability at that date unless AASB 137 _Provisions, Contingent_\n_Liabilities and Contingent Assets would prohibit its recognition in the financial statements of the_\nacquiree. Conversely, if an asset or liability was subsumed in goodwill in accordance with\nprevious GAAP but would have been recognised separately under AASB 3, that asset or liability\nremains in goodwill unless Australian Accounting Standards would require its recognition in the\nfinancial statements of the acquiree.  \n(g) The carrying amount of goodwill in the opening Australian-Accounting-Standards statement of\nfinancial position shall be its carrying amount in accordance with previous GAAP at the date of\ntransition to Australian Accounting Standards, after the following two adjustments:  \n(i) If required by (c)(i) above, the first-time adopter shall increase the carrying amount of\ngoodwill when it reclassifies an item that it recognised as an intangible asset in\naccordance with previous GAAP. Similarly, if (f) above requires the first-time adopter\nto recognise an intangible asset that was subsumed in recognised goodwill in\naccordance with previous GAAP, the first-time adopter shall decrease the carrying\namount of goodwill accordingly (and, if applicable, adjust deferred tax and noncontrolling interests).  \n(ii) Regardless of whether there is any indication that the goodwill may be impaired, the\nfirst-time adopter shall apply AASB 136 in testing the goodwill for impairment at the\ndate of transition to Australian Accounting Standards and in recognising any resulting\nimpairment loss in retained earnings (or, if so required by AASB 136, in revaluation\nsurplus). The impairment test shall be based on conditions at the date of transition to\nAustralian Accounting Standards.  \n(h) No other adjustments shall be made to the carrying amount of goodwill at the date of transition to\nAustralian Accounting Standards. For example, the first-time adopter shall not restate the\ncarrying amount of goodwill:  \n(i) to exclude in-process research and development acquired in that business combination\n(unless the related intangible asset would qualify for recognition in accordance with\nAASB 138 in the statement of financial position of the acquiree);  \n(ii) to adjust previous amortisation of goodwill;  \nSuch changes include reclassifications from or to intangible assets if goodwill was not recognised in accordance with previous GAAP as\nan asset. This arises if, in accordance with previous GAAP, the entity (a) deducted goodwill directly from equity or (b) did not treat the\nbusiness combination as an acquisition.  \n-----  (iii) to reverse adjustments to goodwill that AASB 3 would not permit, but were made in\naccordance with previous GAAP because of adjustments to assets and liabilities\nbetween the date of the business combination and the date of transition to Australian\nAccounting Standards.  \n(i) If the first-time adopter recognised goodwill in accordance with previous GAAP as a deduction\nfrom equity:  \n(i) it shall not recognise that goodwill in its opening Australian-Accounting-Standards\nstatement of financial position. Furthermore, it shall not reclassify that goodwill to\nprofit or loss if it disposes of the subsidiary or if the investment in the subsidiary\nbecomes impaired.  \n(ii) adjustments resulting from the subsequent resolution of a contingency affecting the\npurchase consideration shall be recognised in retained earnings.  \n(j) In accordance with its previous GAAP, the first-time adopter may not have consolidated a\nsubsidiary acquired in a past business combination (for example, because the parent did not\nregard it as a subsidiary in accordance with previous GAAP or did not prepare consolidated\nfinancial statements). The first-time adopter shall adjust the carrying amounts of the subsidiary\u2019s\nassets and liabilities to the amounts that Australian Accounting Standards would require in the\nsubsidiary\u2019s statement of financial position. The deemed cost of goodwill equals the difference at\nthe date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards between:  \n(i) the parent\u2019s interest in those adjusted carrying amounts; and  \n(ii) the cost in the parent\u2019s separate financial statements of its investment in the subsidiary.  \n(k) The measurement of non-controlling interests and deferred tax follows from the measurement of\nother assets and liabilities. Therefore, the above adjustments to recognised assets and liabilities\naffect non-controlling interests and deferred tax.  \nC5 The exemption for past business combinations also applies to past acquisitions of investments in associates,\ninterests in joint ventures and interests in joint operations in which the activity of the joint operation\nconstitutes a business, as defined in AASB 3. Furthermore, the date selected for paragraph C1 applies\nequally for all such acquisitions.  \n-----  ",

At the date of transition to Australian\nAccounting Standards, the entity shall either establish the deemed cost by applying the criteria in\nparagraphs D5\u2013D7 or measure assets and liabilities in accordance with the other requirements in\nthis Standard.  \nD8A Under some national accounting requirements exploration and development costs for oil and gas properties\nin the development or production phases are accounted for in cost centres that include all properties in a\nlarge geographical area.

A lessee\nfollowing this approach shall measure that lease liability at the present value of the remaining\nlease payments (see paragraph D9E), discounted using the lessee\u2019s incremental borrowing rate\n(see paragraph D9E) at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards.  \n(b) measure a right-of-use asset at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards. The\nlessee shall choose, on a lease-by-lease basis, to measure that right-of-use asset at either:  \n(i) its carrying amount as if AASB 16 had been applied since the commencement date of\nthe lease (see paragraph D9E), but discounted using the lessee\u2019s incremental borrowing\nrate at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards; or  \n(ii) an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued\nlease payments relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position\nimmediately before the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards.  \n(c) apply AASB 136 to right-of-use assets at the date of transition to Australian Accounting\nStandards.  \nD9C Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph D9B, a first-time adopter that is a lessee shall measure the\nright-of-use asset at fair value at the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards for leases that\nmeet the definition of investment property in AASB 140 and are measured using the fair value model in\nAASB 140 from the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards.  \nD9D A first-time adopter that is a lessee may do one or more of the following at the date of transition to\nAustralian Accounting Standards, applied on a lease-by-lease basis:  \n(a) apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics (for\nexample, a similar remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying asset in a similar\neconomic environment).  \n(b) elect not to apply the requirements in paragraph D9B to leases for which the lease term (see\nparagraph D9E) ends within 12 months of the date of transition to Australian Accounting\nStandards. Instead, the entity shall account for (including disclosure of information about) these  \n-----  leases as if they were short-term leases accounted for in accordance with paragraph 6 of\nAASB 16.  \n(c) elect not to apply the requirements in paragraph D9B to leases for which the underlying asset is\nof low value (as described in paragraphs B3\u2013B8 of AASB 16). Instead, the entity shall account\nfor (including disclosure of information about) these leases in accordance with paragraph 6 of\nAASB 16.  \n(d) exclude initial direct costs (see paragraph D9E) from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at\nthe date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards.  \n(e) use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or\nterminate the lease.  \nAusD9D.1 Notwithstanding paragraphs D9B\u2013D9D, where a lessee is a not-for-profit entity and the lease had\nat inception significantly below-market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to\nfurther its objectives, all references in those paragraphs to the date of transition to Australian\nAccounting Standards shall be read as referring to the beginning of the current period presented\nin the entity\u2019s first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements.

Any income arising shall be recognised as an_\nadjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or another component of equity, as\nappropriate) at the beginning of the current period presented in the entity\u2019s first AustralianAccounting-Standards financial statements.  \nD9E Lease payments, lessee, lessee\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, commencement date of the lease, initial direct\ncosts and lease term are defined terms in AASB 16 and are used in this Standard with the same meaning.  \nD10\u2013\nD11 [Deleted]",

This applies to entities that are adopting Australian Accounting Standards for the\nfirst time, as well as entities that have previously applied Australian Accounting Standards.  \nD27 The currency of a hyperinflationary economy is subject to severe hyperinflation if it has both of the\nfollowing characteristics:  \n(a) a reliable general price index is not available to all entities with transactions and balances in the\ncurrency.  \n(b) exchangeability between the currency and a relatively stable foreign currency does not exist.  \nD28 The functional currency of an entity ceases to be subject to severe hyperinflation on the functional currency\nnormalisation date. That is the date when the functional currency no longer has either, or both, of the\ncharacteristics in paragraph D27, or when there is a change in the entity\u2019s functional currency to a currency\nthat is not subject to severe hyperinflation.  \nD29 When an entity\u2019s date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards is on, or after, the functional\ncurrency normalisation date, the entity may elect to measure all assets and liabilities held before the\nfunctional currency normalisation date at fair value on the date of transition to Australian Accounting\nStandards. The entity may use that fair value as the deemed cost of those assets and liabilities in the opening\nAustralian-Accounting-Standards statement of financial position.  \nD30 When the functional currency normalisation date falls within a 12-month comparative period, the\ncomparative period may be less than 12 months, provided that a complete set of financial statements (as\nrequired by paragraph 10 of AASB 101) is provided for that shorter period.  \n-----  ",
