Sometimes assessing power is straightforward, such as when power over an investee\nis obtained directly and solely from the voting rights granted by equity instruments such as shares, and can\nbe assessed by considering the voting rights from those shareholdings. In other cases, the assessment will be\nmore complex and require more than one factor to be considered, for example when power results from one\nor more contractual arrangements.  \n12 An investor with the current ability to direct the relevant activities has power even if its rights to direct have\nyet to be exercised. Evidence that the investor has been directing relevant activities can help determine\nwhether the investor has power, but such evidence is not, in itself, conclusive in determining whether the\ninvestor has power over an investee.  \n13 If two or more investors each have existing rights that give them the unilateral ability to direct different\nrelevant activities, the investor that has the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect\nthe returns of the investee has power over the investee.  \n14 An investor can have power over an investee even if other entities have existing rights that give them the\ncurrent ability to participate in the direction of the relevant activities, for example when another entity has\n_significant influence. However, an investor that holds only protective rights does not have power over an_\ninvestee (see paragraphs B26\u2013B28), and consequently does not control the investee.",

One of the equity\ninvestors who holds 30 per cent of the equity is also the asset manager.

        "page_content=": "### Rights that give an investor power over an investee\nB14 Power arises from rights. To have power over an investee, an investor must have existing rights that give the\ninvestor the current ability to direct the relevant activities. The rights that may give an investor power can\ndiffer between investees.  \nB15 Examples of rights that, either individually or in combination, can give an investor power include but are not\nlimited to:  \n(a) rights in the form of voting rights (or potential voting rights) of an investee (see paragraphs B34\u2013\nB50);  \n(b) rights to appoint, reassign or remove members of an investee\u2019s key management personnel who\nhave the ability to direct the relevant activities;  \n(c) rights to appoint or remove another entity that directs the relevant activities;  \n(d) rights to direct the investee to enter into, or veto any changes to, transactions for the benefit of the\ninvestor; and  \n(e) other rights (such as decision-making rights specified in a management contract) that give the\nholder the ability to direct the relevant activities.  \nB16 Generally, when an investee has a range of operating and financing activities that significantly affect the\ninvestee\u2019s returns and when substantive decision-making with respect to these activities is required\ncontinuously, it will be voting or similar rights that give an investor power, either individually or in\ncombination with other arrangements.  \nB17 When voting rights cannot have a significant effect on an investee\u2019s returns, such as when voting rights relate\nto administrative tasks only and contractual arrangements determine the direction of the relevant activities,\nthe investor needs to assess those contractual arrangements in order to determine whether it has rights\nsufficient to give it power over the investee. To determine whether an investor has rights sufficient to give it\npower, the investor shall consider the purpose and design of the investee (see paragraphs B5\u2013B8) and the\nrequirements in paragraphs B51\u2013B54 together with paragraphs B18\u2013B20.  \nB18 In some circumstances it may be difficult to determine whether an investor\u2019s rights are sufficient to give it\npower over an investee. In such cases, to enable the assessment of power to be made, the investor shall\nconsider evidence of whether it has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally.\nConsideration is given, but is not limited, to the following, which, when considered together with its rights\nand the indicators in paragraphs B19 and B20, may provide evidence that the investor\u2019s rights are sufficient\nto give it power over the investee:  \n-----  (a) The investor can, without having the contractual right to do so, appoint or approve the investee\u2019s\nkey management personnel who have the ability to direct the relevant activities.  \n(b) The investor can, without having the contractual right to do so, direct the investee to enter into, or\ncan veto any changes to, significant transactions for the benefit of the investor.  \n(c) The investor can dominate either the nominations process for electing members of the investee\u2019s\ngoverning body or the obtaining of proxies from other holders of voting rights.  \n(d) The investee\u2019s key management personnel are related parties of the investor (for example, the chief\nexecutive officer of the investee and the chief executive officer of the investor are the same person).  \n(e) The majority of the members of the investee\u2019s governing body are related parties of the investor.  \nB19 Sometimes there will be indications that the investor has a special relationship with the investee, which\nsuggests that the investor has more than a passive interest in the investee. The existence of any individual\nindicator, or a particular combination of indicators, does not necessarily mean that the power criterion is met.\nHowever, having more than a passive interest in the investee may indicate that the investor has other related\nrights sufficient to give it power or provide evidence of existing power over an investee. For example, the\nfollowing suggests that the investor has more than a passive interest in the investee and, in combination with\nother rights, may indicate power:  \n(a) The investee\u2019s key management personnel who have the ability to direct the relevant activities are\ncurrent or previous employees of the investor.  \n(b) The investee\u2019s operations are dependent on the investor, such as in the following situations:  \n(i) The investee depends on the investor to fund a significant portion of its operations.  \n(ii) The investor guarantees a significant portion of the investee\u2019s obligations.  \n(iii) The investee depends on the investor for critical services, technology, supplies or raw\nmaterials.  \n(iv) The investor controls assets such as licences or trademarks that are critical to the\ninvestee\u2019s operations.  \n(v) The investee depends on the investor for key management personnel, such as when the\ninvestor\u2019s personnel have specialised knowledge of the investee\u2019s operations.  \n(c) A significant portion of the investee\u2019s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of the\ninvestor.  \n(d) The investor\u2019s exposure, or rights, to returns from its involvement with the investee is\ndisproportionately greater than its voting or other similar rights. For example, there may be a\nsituation in which an investor is entitled, or exposed, to more than half of the returns of the investee\nbut holds less than half of the voting rights of the investee.  \nB20 The greater an investor\u2019s exposure, or rights, to variability of returns from its involvement with an investee,\nthe greater is the incentive for the investor to obtain rights sufficient to give it power. Therefore, having a\nlarge exposure to variability of returns is an indicator that the investor may have power. However, the extent\nof the investor\u2019s exposure does not, in itself, determine whether an investor has power over the investee.  \nB21 When the factors set out in paragraph B18 and the indicators set out in paragraphs B19 and B20 are considered\ntogether with an investor\u2019s rights, greater weight shall be given to the evidence of power described in\nparagraph B18.  \n_Substantive rights_  \nB22 An investor, in assessing whether it has power, considers only substantive rights relating to an investee (held\nby the investor and others). For a right to be substantive, the holder must have the practical ability to exercise\nthat right.  \nB23 Determining whether rights are substantive requires judgement, taking into account all facts and\ncircumstances. Factors to consider in making that determination include but are not limited to:  \n(a) Whether there are any barriers (economic or otherwise) that prevent the holder (or holders) from\nexercising the rights. Examples of such barriers include but are not limited to:  \n(i) financial penalties and incentives that would prevent (or deter) the holder from exercising\nits rights.  \n(ii) an exercise or conversion price that creates a financial barrier that would prevent (or\ndeter) the holder from exercising its rights.  \n-----  (iii) terms and conditions that make it unlikely that the rights would be exercised, for\nexample, conditions that narrowly limit the timing of their exercise.  \n(iv) the absence of an explicit, reasonable mechanism in the founding documents of an\ninvestee or in applicable laws or regulations that would allow the holder to exercise its\nrights.  \n(v) the inability of the holder of the rights to obtain the information necessary to exercise its\nrights.  \n(vi) operational barriers or incentives that would prevent (or deter) the holder from exercising\nits rights (eg the absence of other managers willing or able to provide specialised services\nor provide the services and take on other interests held by the incumbent manager).  \n(vii) legal or regulatory requirements that prevent the holder from exercising its rights (eg\nwhere a foreign investor is prohibited from exercising its rights).  \n(b) When the exercise of rights requires the agreement of more than one party, or when the rights are\nheld by more than one party, whether a mechanism is in place that provides those parties with the\npractical ability to exercise their rights collectively if they choose to do so. The lack of such a\nmechanism is an indicator that the rights may not be substantive. The more parties that are required\nto agree to exercise the rights, the less likely it is that those rights are substantive. However, a board\nof directors whose members are independent of the decision maker may serve as a mechanism for\nnumerous investors to act collectively in exercising their rights. Therefore, removal rights\nexercisable by an independent board of directors are more likely to be substantive than if the same\nrights were exercisable individually by a large number of investors.  \n(c) Whether the party or parties that hold the rights would benefit from the exercise of those rights. For\nexample, the holder of potential voting rights in an investee (see paragraphs B47\u2013B50) shall\nconsider the exercise or conversion price of the instrument. The terms and conditions of potential\nvoting rights are more likely to be substantive when the instrument is in the money or the investor\nwould benefit for other reasons (eg by realising synergies between the investor and the investee)\nfrom the exercise or conversion of the instrument.  \nB24 To be substantive, rights also need to be exercisable when decisions about the direction of the relevant\nactivities need to be made. Usually, to be substantive, the rights need to be currently exercisable. However,\nsometimes rights can be substantive, even though the rights are not currently exercisable.",

An\ninvestor considers the requirements in this section (paragraphs B35\u2013B50) if the relevant activities of an\ninvestee are directed through voting rights.  \n_Power with a majority of the voting rights_  \nB35 An investor that holds more than half of the voting rights of an investee has power in the following situations,\nunless paragraph B36 or paragraph B37 applies:  \n(a) the relevant activities are directed by a vote of the holder of the majority of the voting rights, or  \n(b) a majority of the members of the governing body that directs the relevant activities are appointed\nby a vote of the holder of the majority of the voting rights.  \n_Majority of the voting rights but no power_  \nB36 For an investor that holds more than half of the voting rights of an investee, to have power over an investee,\nthe investor\u2019s voting rights must be substantive, in accordance with paragraphs B22\u2013B25, and must provide\nthe investor with the current ability to direct the relevant activities, which often will be through determining\noperating and financing policies. If another entity has existing rights that provide that entity with the right to\ndirect the relevant activities and that entity is not an agent of the investor, the investor does not have power\nover the investee.  \nB37 An investor does not have power over an investee, even though the investor holds the majority of the voting\nrights in the investee, when those voting rights are not substantive. For example, an investor that has more\nthan half of the voting rights in an investee cannot have power if the relevant activities are subject to direction\nby a government, court, administrator, receiver, liquidator or regulator.  \n_Power without a majority of the voting rights_  \nB38 An investor can have power even if it holds less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee. An investor\ncan have power with less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, for example, through:  \n(a) a contractual arrangement between the investor and other vote holders (see paragraph B39);  \n(b) rights arising from other contractual arrangements (see paragraph B40);  \n(c) the investor\u2019s voting rights (see paragraphs B41\u2013B45);  \n(d) potential voting rights (see paragraphs B47\u2013B50); or  \n(e) a combination of (a)\u2013(d).  \n_Contractual arrangement with other vote holders_  \nB39 A contractual arrangement between an investor and other vote holders can give the investor the right to\nexercise voting rights sufficient to give the investor power, even if the investor does not have voting rights\nsufficient to give it power without the contractual arrangement. However, a contractual arrangement might\nensure that the investor can direct enough other vote holders on how to vote to enable the investor to make\ndecisions about the relevant activities.  \n_Rights from other contractual arrangements_  \nB40 Other decision-making rights, in combination with voting rights, can give an investor the current ability to\ndirect the relevant activities. For example, the rights specified in a contractual arrangement in combination\nwith voting rights may be sufficient to give an investor the current ability to direct the manufacturing\nprocesses of an investee or to direct other operating or financing activities of an investee that significantly\naffect the investee\u2019s returns. However, in the absence of any other rights, economic dependence of an investee\non the investor (such as relations of a supplier with its main customer) does not lead to the investor having\npower over the investee.  \n-----  _The investor\u2019s voting rights_  \nB41 An investor with less than a majority of the voting rights has rights that are sufficient to give it power when\nthe investor has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally.  \nB42 When assessing whether an investor\u2019s voting rights are sufficient to give it power, an investor considers all\nfacts and circumstances, including:  \n(a) the size of the investor\u2019s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of\nthe other vote holders, noting that:  \n(i) the more voting rights an investor holds, the more likely the investor is to have existing\nrights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;  \n(ii) the more voting rights an investor holds relative to other vote holders, the more likely\nthe investor is to have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant\nactivities;  \n(iii) the more parties that would need to act together to outvote the investor, the more likely\nthe investor is to have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant\nactivities;  \n(b) potential voting rights held by the investor, other vote holders or other parties (see paragraphs B47\u2013\nB50);  \n(c) rights arising from other contractual arrangements (see paragraph B40); and  \n(d) any additional facts and circumstances that indicate the investor has, or does not have, the current\nability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting\npatterns at previous shareholders\u2019 meetings.  \nB43 When the direction of relevant activities is determined by majority vote and an investor holds significantly\nmore voting rights than any other vote holder or organised group of vote holders, and the other shareholdings\nare widely dispersed, it may be clear, after considering the factors listed in paragraph B42(a)\u2013(c) alone, that\nthe investor has power over the investee.",

Variable returns can be only positive, only negative or both positive and negative (see paragraph\n15). An investor assesses whether returns from an investee are variable and how variable those returns are on\nthe basis of the substance of the arrangement and regardless of the legal form of the returns. For example, an\ninvestor can hold a bond with fixed interest payments. The fixed interest payments are variable returns for\nthe purpose of this Standard because they are subject to default risk and they expose the investor to the credit\nrisk of the issuer of the bond. The amount of variability (ie how variable those returns are) depends on the\ncredit risk of the bond. Similarly, fixed performance fees for managing an investee\u2019s assets are variable returns\nbecause they expose the investor to the performance risk of the investee. The amount of variability depends\non the investee\u2019s ability to generate sufficient income to pay the fee.  \nB57 Examples of returns include:  \n(a) dividends, other distributions of economic benefits from an investee (eg interest from debt\nsecurities issued by the investee) and changes in the value of the investor\u2019s investment in that\ninvestee.  \n(b) remuneration for servicing an investee\u2019s assets or liabilities, fees and exposure to loss from\nproviding credit or liquidity support, residual interests in the investee\u2019s assets and liabilities on\nliquidation of that investee, tax benefits, and access to future liquidity that an investor has from its\ninvolvement with an investee.  \n(c) returns that are not available to other interest holders. For example, an investor might use its assets\nin combination with the assets of the investee, such as combining operating functions to achieve\neconomies of scale, cost savings, sourcing scarce products, gaining access to proprietary knowledge\nor limiting some operations or assets, to enhance the value of the investor\u2019s other assets.  \n-----  ",

An investor shall also determine whether another entity\nwith decision-making rights is acting as an agent for the investor. An agent is a party primarily engaged to\nact on behalf and for the benefit of another party or parties (the principal(s)) and therefore does not control\nthe investee when it exercises its decision-making authority (see paragraphs 17 and 18). Thus, sometimes a\nprincipal\u2019s power may be held and exercisable by an agent, but on behalf of the principal. A decision maker\nis not an agent simply because other parties can benefit from the decisions that it makes.  \nB59 An investor may delegate its decision-making authority to an agent on some specific issues or on all relevant\nactivities. When assessing whether it controls an investee, the investor shall treat the decision-making rights\ndelegated to its agent as held by the investor directly. In situations where there is more than one principal,\neach of the principals shall assess whether it has power over the investee by considering the requirements in\nparagraphs B5\u2013B54. Paragraphs B60\u2013B72 provide guidance on determining whether a decision maker is an\nagent or a principal.  \nB60 A decision maker shall consider the overall relationship between itself, the investee being managed and other\nparties involved with the investee, in particular all the factors below, in determining whether it is an agent:  \n(a) the scope of its decision-making authority over the investee (paragraphs B62 and B63).  \n(b) the rights held by other parties (paragraphs B64\u2013B67).  \n(c) the remuneration to which it is entitled in accordance with the remuneration agreement(s)\n(paragraphs B68\u2013B70).  \n(d) the decision maker\u2019s exposure to variability of returns from other interests that it holds in the\ninvestee (paragraphs B71 and B72).  \nDifferent weightings shall be applied to each of the factors on the basis of particular facts and circumstances.  \nB61 Determining whether a decision maker is an agent requires an evaluation of all the factors listed in paragraph\nB60 unless a single party holds substantive rights to remove the decision maker (removal rights) and can\nremove the decision maker without cause (see paragraph B65).  \n_The scope of the decision-making authority_  \nB62 The scope of a decision maker\u2019s decision-making authority is evaluated by considering:  \n(a) the activities that are permitted according to the decision-making agreement(s) and specified by\nlaw, and  \n(b) the discretion that the decision maker has when making decisions about those activities.  \nB63 A decision maker shall consider the purpose and design of the investee, the risks to which the investee was\ndesigned to be exposed, the risks it was designed to pass on to the parties involved and the level of\ninvolvement the decision maker had in the design of an investee. For example, if a decision maker is\nsignificantly involved in the design of the investee (including in determining the scope of decision-making\nauthority), that involvement may indicate that the decision maker had the opportunity and incentive to obtain\nrights that result in the decision maker having the ability to direct the relevant activities.  \n_Rights held by other parties_  \nB64 Substantive rights held by other parties may affect the decision maker\u2019s ability to direct the relevant activities\nof an investee. Substantive removal or other rights may indicate that the decision maker is an agent.  \nB65 When a single party holds substantive removal rights and can remove the decision maker without cause, this,\nin isolation, is sufficient to conclude that the decision maker is an agent. If more than one party holds such\nrights (and no individual party can remove the decision maker without the agreement of other parties) those\nrights are not, in isolation, conclusive in determining that a decision maker acts primarily on behalf and for\nthe benefit of others. In addition, the greater the number of parties required to act together to exercise rights\nto remove a decision maker and the greater the magnitude of, and variability associated with, the decision\nmaker\u2019s other economic interests (ie remuneration and other interests), the less the weighting that shall be\nplaced on this factor.  \n-----  B66 Substantive rights held by other parties that restrict a decision maker\u2019s discretion shall be considered in a\nsimilar manner to removal rights when evaluating whether the decision maker is an agent. For example, a\ndecision maker that is required to obtain approval from a small number of other parties for its actions is\ngenerally an agent. (See paragraphs B22\u2013B25 for additional guidance on rights and whether they are\nsubstantive.)  \nB67 Consideration of the rights held by other parties shall include an assessment of any rights exercisable by an\ninvestee\u2019s board of directors (or other governing body) and their effect on the decision-making authority (see\nparagraph B23(b)).  \n_Remuneration_  \nB68 The greater the magnitude of, and variability associated with, the decision maker\u2019s remuneration relative to\nthe returns expected from the activities of the investee, the more likely the decision maker is a principal.  \nB69 In determining whether it is a principal or an agent the decision maker shall also consider whether the\nfollowing conditions exist:  \n(a) The remuneration of the decision maker is commensurate with the services provided.  \n(b) The remuneration agreement includes only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily\npresent in arrangements for similar services and level of skills negotiated on an arm\u2019s length basis.  \nB70 A decision maker cannot be an agent unless the conditions set out in paragraph B69(a) and (b) are present.\nHowever, meeting those conditions in isolation is not sufficient to conclude that a decision maker is an agent.  \n_Exposure to variability of returns from other interests_  \nB71 A decision maker that holds other interests in an investee (eg investments in the investee or provides\nguarantees with respect to the performance of the investee), shall consider its exposure to variability of returns\nfrom those interests in assessing whether it is an agent. Holding other interests in an investee indicates that\nthe decision maker may be a principal.  \nB72 In evaluating its exposure to variability of returns from other interests in the investee a decision maker shall\nconsider the following:  \n(a) the greater the magnitude of, and variability associated with, its economic interests, considering its\nremuneration and other interests in aggregate, the more likely the decision maker is a principal.  \n(b) whether its exposure to variability of returns is different from that of the other investors and, if so,\nwhether this might influence its actions. For example, this might be the case when a decision maker\nholds subordinated interests in, or provides other forms of credit enhancement to, an investee.  \nThe decision maker shall evaluate its exposure relative to the total variability of returns of the investee. This\nevaluation is made primarily on the basis of returns expected from the activities of the investee but shall not\nignore the decision maker\u2019s maximum exposure to variability of returns of the investee through other interests\nthat the decision maker holds.",

One feature that differentiates an\ninvestment entity from other entities is that an investment entity does not plan to hold its investments\nindefinitely; it holds them for a limited period. Because equity investments and non-financial asset\ninvestments have the potential to be held indefinitely, an investment entity shall have an exit strategy\ndocumenting how the entity plans to realise capital appreciation from substantially all of its equity\ninvestments and non-financial asset investments.

Exit mechanisms that are only put in place for default events, such as a breach of\ncontract or non-performance, are not considered exit strategies for the purpose of this assessment.  \nB85G Exit strategies can vary by type of investment. For investments in private equity securities, examples of exit\nstrategies include an initial public offering, a private placement, a trade sale of a business, distributions (to\ninvestors) of ownership interests in investees and sales of assets (including the sale of an investee\u2019s assets\nfollowed by a liquidation of the investee). For equity investments that are traded in a public market, examples\nof exit strategies include selling the investment in a private placement or in a public market. For real estate\ninvestments, an example of an exit strategy includes the sale of the real estate through specialised property\ndealers or the open market.  \nB85H An investment entity may have an investment in another investment entity that is formed in connection with\nthe entity for legal, regulatory, tax or similar business reasons.

In\ndetermining whether to account for the arrangements as a single transaction, a parent shall consider all the\nterms and conditions of the arrangements and their economic effects. One or more of the following indicate\nthat the parent should account for the multiple arrangements as a single transaction:  \n(a) They are entered into at the same time or in contemplation of each other.  \n(b) They form a single transaction designed to achieve an overall commercial effect.  \n(c) The occurrence of one arrangement is dependent on the occurrence of at least one other\narrangement.  \n(d) One arrangement considered on its own is not economically justified, but it is economically\njustified when considered together with other arrangements. An example is when a disposal of\nshares is priced below market and is compensated for by a subsequent disposal priced above market.  \nB98 If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, it shall:  \n(a) derecognise:  \n(i) the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying\namounts at the date when control is lost; and  \n(ii) the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the former subsidiary at the date\nwhen control is lost (including any components of other comprehensive income\nattributable to them).  \n(b) recognise:  \n(i) the fair value of the consideration received, if any, from the transaction, event or\ncircumstances that resulted in the loss of control;  \n(ii) if the transaction, event or circumstances that resulted in the loss of control involves a\ndistribution of shares of the subsidiary to owners in their capacity as owners, that\ndistribution; and  \n(iii) any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control\nis lost.  \n(c) reclassify to profit or loss, or transfer directly to retained earnings if required by other Standards,\nthe amounts recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the basis\ndescribed in paragraph B99.  \n-----  (d) recognise any resulting difference as a gain or loss in profit or loss attributable to the parent.  \nB99 If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, the parent shall account for all amounts previously recognised in\nother comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the parent\nhad directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in\nother comprehensive income would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or\nliabilities, the parent shall reclassify the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification\nadjustment) when it loses control of the subsidiary.

An entity may also present this information for the current period or\nfor earlier comparative periods, but is not required to do so.  \nC2B For the purposes of this Standard, the date of initial application is the beginning of the annual reporting period\nfor which this Standard is applied for the first time.  \nC3 At the date of initial application, an entity is not required to make adjustments to the previous accounting for\nits involvement with either:  \n(a) entities that would be consolidated at that date in accordance with AASB 127 Consolidated and\n_Separate Financial Statements and Interpretation 112 Consolidation\u2014Special Purpose Entities and_\nare still consolidated in accordance with this Standard; or  \n(b) entities that would not be consolidated at that date in accordance with AASB 127 and Interpretation\n112 and are not consolidated in accordance with this Standard.  \nC3A At the date of initial application, an entity shall assess whether it is an investment entity on the basis of the\nfacts and circumstances that exist at that date. If, at the date of initial application, an entity concludes that it\nis an investment entity, it shall apply the requirements of paragraphs C3B\u2013C3F instead of paragraphs C5\u2013\nC5A.  \nC3B Except for any subsidiary that is consolidated in accordance with paragraph 32 (to which paragraphs C3 and\nC6 or paragraphs C4\u2013C4C, whichever is relevant, apply), an investment entity shall measure its investment\nin each subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss as if the requirements of this Standard had always been\neffective. The investment entity shall retrospectively adjust both the annual period that immediately precedes\nthe date of initial application and equity at the beginning of the immediately preceding period for any\ndifference between:  \n-----  (a) the previous carrying amount of the subsidiary; and  \n(b) the fair value of the investment entity\u2019s investment in the subsidiary.  \nThe cumulative amount of any fair value adjustments previously recognised in other comprehensive income\nshall be transferred to retained earnings at the beginning of the annual period immediately preceding the date\nof initial application.  \nC3C Before the date that AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement is adopted, an investment entity shall use the fair\nvalue amounts that were previously reported to investors or to management, if those amounts represent the\namount for which the investment could have been exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an\narm\u2019s length transaction at the date of the valuation.  \nC3D If measuring an investment in a subsidiary in accordance with paragraphs C3B\u2013C3C is impracticable (as\ndefined in AASB 108), an investment entity shall apply the requirements of this Standard at the beginning of\nthe earliest period for which application of paragraphs C3B\u2013C3C is practicable, which may be the current\nperiod.

If control was obtained before the effective\ndate of AASB 3 (2008), an investor shall apply either AASB 3 (2008) or AASB 3 (issued in 2004).  \nC4C When an investor applies paragraphs C4\u2013C4A and the date that control was obtained in accordance with this\nStandard is later than the effective date of AASB 127 as revised in 2008 (AASB 127 (2008)), an investor\nshall apply the requirements of this Standard for all periods that the investee is retrospectively consolidated\nin accordance with paragraphs C4\u2013C4A. If control was obtained before the effective date of AASB 127\n(2008), an investor shall apply either:  \n(a) the requirements of this Standard for all periods that the investee is retrospectively consolidated in\naccordance with paragraphs C4\u2013C4A; or  \n(b) the requirements of the version of AASB 127 issued in 2004 (AASB 127 (2004)) for those periods\nprior to the effective date of AASB 127 (2008) and thereafter the requirements of this Standard for\nsubsequent periods.  \nC5 If, at the date of initial application, an investor concludes that it will no longer consolidate an investee that\nwas consolidated in accordance with AASB 127 and Interpretation 112, the investor shall measure its interest\nin the investee at the amount at which it would have been measured if the requirements of this Standard had\nbeen effective when the investor became involved with (but did not obtain control in accordance with this\nStandard), or lost control of, the investee. The investor shall adjust retrospectively the annual period\nimmediately preceding the date of initial application. When the date that the investor became involved with\n(but did not obtain control in accordance with this Standard), or lost control of, the investee is earlier than the\nbeginning of the immediately preceding period, the investor shall recognise, as an adjustment to equity at the\nbeginning of the immediately preceding period, any difference between:  \n(a) the previous carrying amount of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests; and  \n(b) the recognised amount of the investor\u2019s interest in the investee.  \nC5A If measuring the interest in the investee in accordance with paragraph C5 is impracticable (as defined in\nAASB 108), an investor shall apply the requirements of this Standard at the beginning of the earliest period\nfor which application of paragraph C5 is practicable, which may be the current period. The investor shall\nadjust retrospectively the annual period immediately preceding the date of initial application, unless the\nbeginning of the earliest period for which application of this paragraph is practicable is the current period.\nWhen the date that the investor became involved with (but did not obtain control in accordance with this\nStandard), or lost control of, the investee is earlier than the beginning of the immediately preceding period,\nthe investor shall recognise, as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the immediately preceding period,\nany difference between:  \n(a) the previous carrying amount of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests; and  \n(b) the recognised amount of the investor\u2019s interest in the investee.  \nIf the earliest period for which application of this paragraph is practicable is the current period, the adjustment\nto equity shall be recognised at the beginning of the current period.  \nC6 Paragraphs 23, 25, B94 and B96\u2013B99 were amendments to AASB 127 made in 2008 that were carried\nforward into AASB 10. Except when an entity applies paragraph C3, or is required to apply paragraphs C4\u2013\nC5A, the entity shall apply the requirements in those paragraphs as follows:  \n(a) An entity shall not restate any profit or loss attribution for reporting periods before it applied the\namendment in paragraph B94 for the first time.  \n(b) The requirements in paragraphs 23 and B96 for accounting for changes in ownership interests in a\nsubsidiary after control is obtained do not apply to changes that occurred before an entity applied\nthese amendments for the first time.  \n(c) An entity shall not restate the carrying amount of an investment in a former subsidiary if control\nwas lost before it applied the amendments in paragraphs 25 and B97\u2013B99 for the first time. In  \n-----  addition, an entity shall not recalculate any gain or loss on the loss of control of a subsidiary that\noccurred before the amendments in paragraphs 25 and B97\u2013B99 were applied for the first time.",

        "page_content=": "## Power  \nIG5 One of the criteria set out in paragraph 7 for control of an investee is that the investor has power over the\ninvestee. Paragraph 10 states that an investor has power over an investee when the investor has existing rights\nthat give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, that is, the activities that significantly affect the\ninvestee\u2019s returns. As an example, a not-for-profit investor would have power over an investee when the\ninvestor can require the investee to deploy its assets or incur liabilities in a way that affects the investee\u2019s\nreturns (for example, in providing goods or services to the investor or other parties that assist in achieving or\nfurthering the investee\u2019s objectives).  \nIG6 Paragraph 11 states that power arises from rights, and refers to voting rights granted by equity instruments\nand rights arising from contractual arrangements. While these rights will often be the source of power for\nfor-profit entities, power will frequently arise through different sources for not-for-profit entities. For many\nnot-for-profit entities, rights arising from administrative arrangements or statutory provisions will often be\nthe source of power. Assessing the purpose and design of an investee will assist an investor to identify who\nhas power over the investee, ie the current ability to direct the relevant activities (paragraph B5).  \nIG7 As an example of contractual or statutory arrangements, a not-for-profit investor often will have power over\nan investee that it has established when the constituting document or enabling legislation for the investee\nspecifies the investor\u2019s rights to direct the operating and financing activities that may be carried out by the\ninvestee. However, the impact of the constituting document or legislation is evaluated in the context of the\nprevailing circumstances, as all facts and circumstances need to be considered in assessing whether an\ninvestor has power over an investee. For example, the purpose and design of an investee may point to the\nrelevant activities of the investee and how decisions about the relevant activities are made. To illustrate, a\ngovernment may not have power over a research and development corporation that operates under a mandate\ncreated, and limited, by that government\u2019s legislation if that or other legislation means that the power to direct\nthe relevant activities is held by other entities that are not controlled by the government, such as participants\nin the research and development activities.  \n-----  IG8 The research and development corporation example in the previous paragraph illustrates that an investor\nmight not have power over an investee due to the rights of other parties in relation to the investee, as indicated\nin paragraph B10. As another example, subject to consideration of all the facts and circumstances, a State or\nTerritory government normally would not have power to direct the relevant activities (ie the activities that\nsignificantly affect the returns) of a local government that determines through the council elected periodically\nby the local community how to deploy the local government\u2019s resources in the interests of the local\ncommunity (even though those interests might coincide with or overlap the interests of the State or Territory\ngovernment).",

        "page_content=": "### Rights that give an investor power over an investee\nIG9 Paragraph B15 provides examples of rights that, either individually or in combination, can give an investor\npower in respect of an investee. In relation to not-for-profit investors, additional examples of such rights\ninclude:  \n(a) rights to give policy directions to the governing body of the investee that give the holder the ability\nto direct the relevant activities of the investee; and  \n(b) rights to approve or veto operating and capital budgets relating to the relevant activities of the\ninvestee.  \nIG10 A not-for-profit investor can have power over an investee even if it does not have responsibility for the dayto-day operation of the investee or the specific manner in which prescribed functions are performed by the\ninvestee. For example, legislation governing the establishment and operation of an independent statutory\noffice (such as an auditor-general or the judiciary) sets out the broad parameters within which the office holder\nis required to operate, and results in the office holder operating in a manner consistent with the objectives set\nby the legislation. Whilst the holders of an independent statutory office are to act independently in\ndischarging their responsibilities, the government typically provides the organisations that assist the statutory\noffice holders in fulfilling their responsibilities. In such cases, the resources of those organisations remain\ngovernment resources albeit that they are placed at the disposal of the office holders, subject to the office\nholders acting in accordance with their enabling legislation. Furthermore, the relevant activities of the\norganisations, including providing technical services to the statutory office holders, are generally subject to\nthe same financial management, employment and administrative frameworks and policies as would apply to\ngovernment-controlled entities such as government departments. Therefore, subject to other facts and\ncircumstances, assuming the other control criteria are also satisfied, the organisations assisting the\nindependent statutory office holders would be controlled by the government and would be consolidated into\nthe whole of government general purpose financial statements.  \nIG11 Paragraph B19 lists a range of indicators that suggest that an investor has more than a passive interest in an\ninvestee, but notes that the existence of such indicators does not necessarily mean that the power criterion is\nmet. The indicators listed include the investee\u2019s operations being dependent on the investor, such as\ndependence on the investor to fund a significant portion of its operations, guarantee a significant portion of\nits obligations or provide critical goods or services. Paragraph B40 also states that, in the absence of other\nrights, the economic dependence of an investee on the investor does not lead to the investor having power\nover the investee.  \nIG12 An example of the circumstances contemplated in paragraphs B19 and B40 is that a government may not\nhave the current ability to direct the relevant activities of entities (such as private schools, private hospitals,\nprivate aged-care providers and universities) that are financially dependent on government funding, where\nthe governing bodies of those entities have discretion with respect to whether they will accept resources from\nthe government, or the manner in which their resources are to be deployed. This may be so even if government\ngrants provided to such entities require them to comply with specified conditions. Although these entities\nmight receive government grants for capital construction and operating costs subject to specified service\nstandards or restrictions on user fees, their independent governing body may have ultimate discretion about\nhow assets are deployed.  \n_Substantive rights_  \nIG13 Barriers that prevent a holder of rights from exercising them are considered in determining whether the rights\nare substantive, that is, whether the holder has the practical ability to exercise the rights (paragraph B22).\nParagraph B23 provides examples of such barriers. For some not-for-profit investors, political, cultural, social\nor similar types of barriers might make it difficult for the investor to exercise rights held in relation to an\ninvestee. However, the investor\u2019s rights would be substantive, despite such barriers, if the investor can still\nchoose to exercise those rights. For example, a government may have the power to appoint and remove the\nmajority of members of the governing body of a railway authority without cause but may be reluctant to  \n-----  remove members because of sensitivity in the electorate regarding the previous government\u2019s involvement in\nthe operation of the rail network. In this case, the government has substantive rights, irrespective of whether\nit chooses to exercise them.  \nIG14 Paragraph B24 states that to be substantive, rights need to be exercisable when decisions about the direction\nof the relevant activities need to be made. Usually this means that the rights need to be currently exercisable.\nHowever, paragraph B24 also notes that sometimes rights can be substantive even though they are not\ncurrently exercisable. For many not-for-profit investors, power over an investee may be obtained from\nexisting statutory arrangements. Rights specified in substantively enacted legislation would be substantive\nrights that need to be considered by the investor in assessing control of an investee if it is assessed that the\nrights will be exercisable when decisions about the direction of the relevant activities need to be made.\nHowever, the power to enact or change legislation does not give the investor the current ability to direct\nrelevant activities of the investee. Depending on circumstances, statutory arrangements may be in the nature\nof protective rights rather than substantive rights \u2013 see paragraphs IG15\u2013IG17.  \n_Protective rights_  \nIG15 Protective rights are defined in Appendix A as rights designed to protect the interest of the party holding those\nrights without giving that party power over the entity to which those rights relate. Applying this principle to\nnot-for-profit entities, protective rights include rights held by a government or other entity in order to protect,\nas distinct from enhance, the interests of the government, the beneficiaries of an entity or the public at large.\nIn accordance with paragraph B27, such rights do not result in the investor (the government or other entity)\nhaving power over an investee or restricting another entity from having power over the investee.  \nIG16 Not-for-profit entities might hold regulatory powers that restrict the way in which regulated entities operate.\nThe regulatory powers may be exercisable through an established framework within which entities are\nrequired to operate, including the ability to impose conditions or sanctions on their operations. Regulatory\npowers may represent protective rights, which do not give power (as defined in the Standard) over an investee,\nor substantive rights that need to be considered in determining control. For example, regulatory powers may\nrepresent substantive rights when they would have the effect of giving the regulator the ability to direct the\nrelevant activities of an investee in particular circumstances. Not-for-profit investors are required by\nparagraph B26 to assess whether their rights (and rights held by others) are protective or substantive rights.  \nIG17 In addition to the examples in paragraph B28, examples of protective rights in relation to not-for-profit entities\ninclude:  \n(a) the right of a regulator to curtail or close the operations of entities that are not complying with\nregulations or other requirements. For example, a pollution control authority may be able to close\ndown an entity\u2019s activities that breach environmental regulations.  \n(b) the right to remove members of the governing body of another entity under certain restricted\ncircumstances. For example, for reasons relating to a lack of probity, a State government may be\nable to remove or suspend the councillors of a local government and appoint an administrator who\nis not directed by the State government in carrying out the functions of the local government.  \n(c) the right to appoint additional members to the governing body of another entity under certain\nrestricted circumstances. For example, when the entity has failed to comply with performance\nstandards, a regulator may be able to appoint appropriately qualified members who are in the same\nposition as other members \u2013 they do not report to and are not directed by the regulator.  \n(d) the right of the government to remove tax deductibility for contributions to a not-for-profit entity\nif the entity significantly changes its objectives or activities.  \n(e) a philanthropic trust providing resources to a charity on condition that the net assets of the charity\nwould be distributed to a similar organisation undertaking similar activities if the charity is\nliquidated.",

The examples of returns in paragraph B57,\nparticularly those in paragraph B57(c), indicate that the scope of the nature of returns is broad.

        "page_content=": "### Delegated power\nIG21 An investor with decision-making rights (a decision maker) is required by paragraph B58 to determine\nwhether it is a principal or an agent. Paragraphs B60 and B61 summarise factors to be taken into account in\nmaking that determination, such as the scope of the decision-making authority and the rights of other parties.\nThe following examples illustrate these paragraphs in relation to not-for-profit entities.  \nIG22 A charity establishes a trust to fund and construct village dams, bores and other water infrastructure in several\nprovinces of a developing country. The trustee is appointed by the charity to oversee the work of the trust.\nThe trustee receives remuneration from the trust commensurate with the services provided and the skills\napplied, plus a performance bonus upon the successful completion of individual projects. The charity can\nreplace the trustee at its discretion. The trustee therefore is an agent of the charity and cannot control the trust\nin its own right. In this case, the charity then needs to assess whether it controls the trust through the trustee.\nFor example:  \n(a) the trustee may have power over the trust in having the current ability to direct its relevant activities,\nwhether through a broad decision-making authority or as determined by the charity in respect of\nmajor aspects, such as project selection. Even if the trustee does not have exposure or rights to\nvariable returns from the trust, the charity does so in terms of the extent to which its overseas aid\nobjectives are achieved or furthered through the activities of the trust. Since the trustee (as an agent\nof the charity) can use its powers to affect the trust\u2019s non-financial returns, the three control criteria\nare satisfied in respect of the charity and the charity would control the trust; or  \n(b) the trustee may be permitted by development regulations of the provincial governments to provide\nonly oversight of the trust\u2019s activities, which are carried out in general by management committees\nappointed by the relevant provincial government. In this case, the trustee does not have the power\nto direct the relevant activities of the trust, and accordingly the charity would not control the trust.  \nIG23 A government department acts in relation to an investee only as an agent of the responsible Minister when\nthe department or an official of the department is merely authorised by the Minister to act on the Minister\u2019s\nbehalf (in which case the department\u2019s activities in relation to the investee would be reflected in its reporting\nunder AASB 1050 Administered Items).  \nIG24 Alternatively, a department acts as a principal under a delegation of powers from the Minister as the\ndepartment or an official of the department exercises their own discretion, not subject to specific direction by\nthe Minister. In this case, the department would report its activities in relation to the investee as its own\ntransactions. The department would need to assess whether the delegated powers give it the current ability\nto direct the relevant activities of the investee and whether the other control criteria are satisfied in deciding\nwhether the department controls the investee and should consolidate it.",

TUV\u2019s\nmanagement is also responsible for developing the company\u2019s policies, including:  \n-  the scope of the training courses, such as the type of courses and the maximum number of\nparticipants for each course;  \n-  marketing plans for the courses, including the fee structure;  \n-----  -  the frequency and location of courses; and  \n-  the use of in-house or off-the-shelf training materials.  \nThese policies address the relevant activities of TUV, ie the activities that significantly affect the\ncompany\u2019s returns.  \nThe board of TUV meets regularly to review reports from TUV management in order to assess the\nperformance of the company. The board makes decisions about the company\u2019s activities and policies\nso as to optimise its outcomes. For example, the board might modify the scope or frequency of\ncourses or revise the fee structure.  \nThe TUV board also considers whether any profits should be distributed to the charity (FGH) as a\nfinancial return or used to improve or expand the company\u2019s activities.",

The Council is\nadministered by the councillors, who are elected directly by the local community in periodic\nelections. General requirements for the elections are set out in the Act.  \n_Objectives of the Council_  \nThe Act specifies that the Council\u2019s primary objective is to achieve the best outcomes for the local\ncommunity over the long term. In working to achieve this objective, the Council must have regard\nto:  \n-  promoting the social, economic and environmental viability and sustainability of the municipal\ndistrict;  \n-  ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively and that services provided are\naccessible and equitable;  \n-  the equitable imposition of rates and charges; and  \n-  transparency and accountability in Council decision making.  \n_Powers and Functions of the Council_  \nThe Council is empowered by the Act to do all things necessary and convenient for the achievement\nof its objectives and the performance of its functions, subject to any limitations under the Act or any\nother legislation (see the sections on the State Government\u2019s protective and substantive rights later in\nthis example).  \nThe Council\u2019s functions include:  \n-  raising revenue to fund its functions and activities;  \n-  planning for and providing services and facilities (including infrastructure) for the local\ncommunity;  \n-  strategic and land-use planning;  \n-  making and enforcing local laws; and  \n-  advocating proposals that are in the best interests of the district.  \n-----  _Activities of the Council_  \nIn carrying out its functions, the Council undertakes a wide range of activities, including the\nemployment of staff, the imposition of rates and charges upon constituents, the establishment and\nimplementation of policies and procedures, the purchase or sale of goods or services from or to\nconstituents or other parties, the provision without charge of services such as parks and roads,\ntransactions under financial contracts and prosecuting legal actions.  \n_State Government Involvement with the Council_  \nThe State Government\u2019s objectives for the government of the municipal district are consistent with\nthe objectives of the Council, since the State Government set out the Council\u2019s objectives in the\nState\u2019s Local Government Act.  \nConsequently, the Council is subject to a wide range of State Government regulatory powers, even\nthough its day-to-day operations are carried out by the Council\u2019s staff under the direction of its\nelected councillors. The State Government\u2019s rights in respect of the Council are held primarily by\nthe Minister for Local Government, but other Ministers also hold some additional powers, such as\nland-use planning powers held by the Minister for Planning.  \nThe interest of the State Government in the activities of the Council is to ensure that the general\nobjectives set out in the Act are being achieved or furthered. To that end, the State Government has\nan extensive range of rights (through its Ministers) to advise or guide the Council in its activities or,\nunder particular circumstances, to intervene in the activities of the Council. The principal rights of\nthe State Government are described in the following sections.  \nProtective rights of the State Government  \nSome of the State Government\u2019s rights are protective rights, as described in paragraph B26: rights\nthat relate to fundamental changes to the activities of the Council (the investee) or that apply in\nexceptional circumstances. For example, the Minister has the following rights that are regarded as\nprotective rights for the purpose of this example:  \n-  restructure the municipal district through boundary changes;  \n-  abolish the existing Council and constitute a new Council or Councils, with the Minister able to\ndirect the transfer of property, income, assets, rights, liabilities, expenses and staff among\nCouncils as part of the process;  \n-  suspend all the councillors of the Council if the Minister is satisfied that there has been a serious\nfailure to provide good government or serious unlawful acts by the Council \u2013 in which case an\nadministrator is appointed to act as the Council and to perform its functions, powers and duties;  \n-  appoint inspectors of municipal administration to examine any particular Council matter and\nmake recommendations to the Council, and enforce those recommendations if the Council does\nnot adopt them;  \n-  revoke local laws passed by the Council where, in the Minister\u2019s opinion, the laws substantially\nrestrict competition without appropriate justification;  \n-  approve (or veto) Council entering into an entrepreneurial endeavour that exceeds 5% of the\nCouncil\u2019s revenue from rates and charges;  \n-  approve (or veto) investment by the Council in types of financial instruments not already\napproved under the Act; and  \n-  make guidelines concerning the Council\u2019s procurement policy or the provision of services by the\nCouncil so as to best meet the needs of the local community.  \nSubstantive rights of the State Government  \nThe State Government also has a range of rights that do not fall into the category of protective rights.\nFor example, Ministers have the following rights that, for the purpose of this example, are classified\nas substantive rights:  \n-  give directions concerning rates and charges to limit the rate of change in the Council\u2019s general\nincome for a financial year;  \n-----  -  review the allowance category annually for the Council, including the limits and ranges of\ncouncillor allowances; and  \n-  prepare a planning scheme for the district or authorise an amendment subject to any conditions\nthat the Minister wishes to impose.  \n_Control of the Council_  \nBased on the facts and circumstances outlined above, does the State Government control the Council\nin accordance with the definition of control in the Standard? If not, who controls the Council?  \nRelevant activities  \nThe State Government has numerous rights in relation to the Council. Whereas the State\nGovernment\u2019s protective rights cannot give power over the Council, the substantive rights do give\nthe State Government the current ability to direct some activities of the Council.  \nHowever, paragraph 10 of the Standard states that an investor has power over an investee when the\ninvestor has the current ability to direct the relevant activities, ie the activities that significantly affect\nthe investee\u2019s returns. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the relevant activities of the Council, and\nthen assess the State Government\u2019s substantive rights in respect of those activities relative to the\nrights of other parties.  \nJudgement is required in identifying the relevant activities, as this requires identifying both the\nCouncil\u2019s returns and the activities of the Council that significantly affect those returns. As a notfor-profit entity, the Council\u2019s non-financial returns for the community are considered to be of\nprimary importance, even though its objectives also include financial aspects, such as the efficient\nuse of resources and equitable rates and charges. The objectives do not include the raising of\nrevenue per se.  \nAll of the Council\u2019s activities and functions contribute (whether positively or negatively) to the\nCouncil achieving or furthering its objectives. Thus they are activities that affect the financial and\nnon-financial returns of the Council. But which activities significantly affect the Council\u2019s returns?\nGiven the significance of non-financial returns for the Council, it is considered that the provision of\nservices and facilities for the community and regulating other parties\u2019 activities in the community (eg\nproperty development, health services and shopping centres) are the activities that most significantly\naffect the Council\u2019s returns. Consequently, these are likely to be the relevant activities of the\nCouncil.  \nPower  \nParagraph B10 states that whether an investor has power over an investee depends on, for example,\nthe rights the investor and other parties have in relation to the investee. When two or more parties\neach have existing rights that give them the unilateral ability to direct different relevant activities, the\nparty that has the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the investee\u2019s\nreturns has power over the investee (paragraph 13 of the Standard). Does the State Government have\nthe power, the current ability, to direct the relevant activities of the Council?  \nThe substantive rights of the State Government do give it the current ability to direct some of the\nactivities of the Council, such as amending or replacing planning schemes. However, the State\nGovernment is unable to direct the major part of the activities that significantly affect the Council\u2019s\nreturns. Therefore, the State Government does not hold power over the Council as described in the\nStandard.  \nThe power to direct the relevant activities is held by the councillors of the Council, who direct,\nwithin the framework established by the State Government, the vast majority of the Council\u2019s\nactivities that affect the returns from its operations.  \nThe State Government\u2019s right to give directions to limit the rate of change in the Council\u2019s general\nincome (rates and charges) is in the nature of price regulation rather than directing relevant activities.\nThe raising of revenue itself is not a relevant activity, as identified above, because revenue by itself\nis not one of the Council\u2019s returns or objectives.  \n-----  Returns  \nThe State Government is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the\nCouncil since the activities of the Council contribute to the achievement or furtherance of the State\nGovernment\u2019s objectives for the good government and appropriate development of the municipal\ndistrict.  \nAbility to use power to affect returns  \nSince it was concluded above that in the circumstances presented the State Government does not\nhave power (as described in the Standard) over the Council, then the third control criterion linking\npower and returns is also not satisfied. The State Government is able to affect the Council\u2019s returns,\nand thus its own indirect returns, through exercising its substantive rights. However, the State\nGovernment is unable to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Council\u2019s returns.  \nControl conclusion  \nThe conclusion from the above assessment is that the State Government does not have power over\nthe Council and therefore does not control the Council.  \nIn this case, the Council would not be consolidated by any other entity. The councillors of the\nCouncil as a group are not investors as contemplated by the Standard. They are akin to the board of\ndirectors of a company, that is, the councillors are a part of the Council itself.  \n_Alternative Outcome_  \nThe distinction between protective and substantive rights and the significance of the substantive\nrights to the Council\u2019s returns are matters for judgement in view of all the facts and circumstances in\nany particular situation. A different list or classification of relevant activities, protective rights and\nsubstantive rights from that presented in this example might change the conclusion on control of the\nCouncil.",

The University receives\napproximately 40% of its total revenue in the form of grants for various purposes, comprising 30%\nfrom the Australian Government and 10% from the State Government. The University is required by\nthe Act to submit an annual report to the State Minister for Education.  \n_Objectives of the University_  \nThe Act specifies that the University\u2019s objects include:  \n-  to provide higher education at an international standard;  \n-  to undertake scholarship and research for the advancement of knowledge and the benefit of the\nwell-being of the State, Australian and international communities;  \n-  to equip graduates to excel in their careers and contribute to the life of the community; and  \n-  to serve the State, Australian and international communities and the public interest by enriching\ncultural and community life and promoting critical and free inquiry and public debate.  \n_Management of the University_  \nThe governing body of the University is the University Council. The Council consists of 17\nmembers, five of whom were appointed directly or indirectly by the State Minister. Four members\nwere elected by the staff and students of the University. The remaining eight members were\nappointed by the Council itself, comprising the three official members (the Chancellor, the ViceChancellor and the President of the Academic Board) and five other (non-official) members.  \n-----  The Act specifies that the number of Minister-appointed members (five members in this case) must\nbe equal to or greater than the number of non-official Council-appointed members (also five).  \nThe Act specifies that the University Council\u2019s responsibilities, powers and functions include:  \n-  approving the mission, strategic direction and annual budget and business plan of the University;  \n-  establishing policies (\u2018university statutes and regulations\u2019) relating to the governance and\noperation of the University, including trusts and endowments, and research, development,\nconsultancy, commercial activities and other services undertaken for commercial organisations\nor public bodies;  \n-  developing guidelines (if any) concerning the carrying out of commercial activities, finance and\nproperty matters, or any other related matter;  \n-  overseeing the management of the property, finances and business affairs of the University, such\nas risk management across the University, including its commercial activities;  \n-  any other powers and functions conferred on it by or under legislation or any university statute\nor regulation; and  \n-  the power to do anything else necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with its\npowers and functions.  \n_Activities of the University_  \nIn carrying out its functions, the University undertakes a wide range of activities, including\nemploying academic, teaching and administrative staff, determining fees and charges for courses\nprovided to students and for commercial activities, entering into contracts, and forming or becoming\na member of other entities.  \n_State Government Involvement with the University_  \nThe State Government\u2019s objectives for the University are consistent with, but not limited to, those\nspecified in the Act for the University. For example, the State Government anticipates State\neconomic development as a result of the University\u2019s activities, such as the provision of housing and\ntourism services to international students.  \nThe State Minister has the following powers and functions, which are classified in this example as\nsubstantive rights under the Standard:  \n-  fix the remuneration and fees to be paid to Council members who are not full-time staff of the\nUniversity or holders of statutory office;  \n-  approve (or veto) University statutes and guidelines made by the Council;  \n-  declare an activity to be a university commercial activity;  \n-  make interim guidelines concerning university commercial activities and finance and property\nmatters \u2013 these apply unless replaced by University-submitted guidelines approved by the\nMinister;  \n-  certain rights specified in State Government grants provided to the University \u2013 some of the\ngrants detail the education or research activities to be carried out under the grant;  \n-  in conjunction with the State Treasurer, approve the limits and conditions (eg security) for\nUniversity borrowings; and  \n-  approve (or veto) the disposal of land that was previously Crown land granted to the University.  \nThe Minister also has the following powers, which are classified as protective rights for the purpose\nof this example:  \n-  request commercial and financial reports from the University;  \n-  refer a university commercial activity or any aspect thereof to the auditor-general for\ninvestigation and report to the Minister; and  \n-  certain rights specified in State Government grants provided to the University \u2013 some of the\ngrants are required to be repaid if not applied as specified.  \n-----  _Australian Government Involvement with the University_  \nThe Australian Government\u2019s objectives for the University are consistent with, but not limited to,\nthose specified in the State Act for the University. For example, the Australian Government\nanticipates national economic development as a result of the University\u2019s activities and may seek to\nadvance foreign policy objectives through universities attracting international students.  \nThe Australian Minister for Education also has the rights specified in Australian Government grants\nprovided to the University. Some of these grants specify how they are to be applied to education or\nresearch activities (which are substantive rights for the purpose of this example) and some require\ntheir repayment if not applied as specified (protective rights for the purpose of this example).  \nThe Minister can also request reports from the University.  \n_University Council-directed Activities_  \nAs indicated above, the University\u2019s commercial activities and finance and property matters are\nsubject to various State Government Ministerial powers, and government grants may be conditional.\nHowever, the University Council also has a range of powers and functions that it can exercise\ndirectly, such as the following:  \n-  appoint the Vice-Chancellor, who is the chief executive officer of the University and responsible\nfor the conduct of the University\u2019s affairs in all matters;  \n-  determine the composition of borrowings within the parameters set by the State Government;  \n-  approve the University\u2019s budget for a financial year, incorporating total revenue and the planned\nrevenue sources, including planning the mix between teaching, research and commercial\nactivities, the fees and charges to apply to those activities, and the type and value of government\ngrants desired;  \n-  determine the course mix and target student mix, such as vocational, undergraduate, graduate\nand executive courses, on-campus or distance learning, and local and international students;  \n-  appoint staff and determine their terms and conditions;  \n-  decide whether to operate through multiple campuses and how to utilise the University\u2019s\ninfrastructure; and  \n-  make university regulations with respect to any matter relating to the University.",

        "page_content=": "### Example IG4A\n_Control of the University_  \nBased on the facts and circumstances outlined above, does the State Government or the Australian\nGovernment control the University in accordance with the definition of control in the Standard? If\nnot, who controls the University?  \nEconomic dependence  \nThe State and Australian Governments each has a range of rights in relation to the University. The\nUniversity may be economically dependent on the grants from those Governments in order to carry\nout its activities at their present scope and scale, but paragraphs B19 and B40 of the Standard make\nclear that economic dependence alone does not lead to the investor having power (as that term is\nused in AASB 10) over the investee. The State Government and Australian Government rights under\nsome of their grants to the University to recover misapplied funds amount to protective rights. The\nrepayment of such grants, potentially coupled with a reduction of Government grants in the future\ngiven the lack of compliance with grant conditions, may require the University to curtail its activities\ndue to the reduction in funding. However, such a curtailment does not involve either Government in\ndirecting activities of the University, since it is the University that would determine which activities\nwould be curtailed.  \nRelevant activities  \nJudgement is required to identify the University\u2019s relevant activities, that is, the activities that\n_significantly affect the University\u2019s returns. All of the University\u2019s activities and functions_\ncontribute in some way (positive or negative) to the University achieving or furthering its objectives.  \n-----  Thus they are activities that affect the financial and non-financial returns of the University.\nHowever, as the University has fairly limited commercial activities in this example, the activities that\nmost significantly affect the University\u2019s returns are the education and research activities.  \nPower  \nProtective rights held by the State and Australian Governments cannot give them power over the\nUniversity. Instead, their substantive rights concerning the University\u2019s education and research\nactivities (the relevant activities) need to be weighed against the rights of the University Council\nitself, in order to assess which party has the current ability to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly affect the University\u2019s returns (or outcomes).  \nIt is the University Council that generally directs the education and research activities. For example,\nthe Council decides the mix between education, research and commercial activities, the courses to be\noffered, the target student mix, the fee structure and how to use the University\u2019s infrastructure for the\nactivities. Some grants from the State and Australian Governments direct how they are to be applied,\nbut these affect only a relatively small proportion of the education and research activities overall. On\nbalance, the University Council itself appears to have the current ability to direct the relevant\nactivities of the University.  \nSince the State Minister is able to appoint members of the University Council, it is necessary to\nconsider whether the State Minister has power over the University through substantive rights to\nappoint a majority of the members of the University Council. In this example, the State Minister can\nappoint only five of the 17 members of the University Council. Therefore, the State Government is\nunable to direct the relevant activities of the University through appointments to the University\nCouncil.  \nThe State Government\u2019s substantive rights in relation to the University\u2019s commercial activities or\nbusiness operations are not considered in this assessment of control, since they do not relate to the\nrelevant activities.  \nNeither the State Government nor the Australian Government would have power (as described in the\nStandard) over the University.  \nReturns  \nThe State and Australian Governments are exposed, or have rights, to variable returns from their\ninvolvement with the University since the activities of the University contribute to the achievement\nor furtherance of the State Government\u2019s and the Australian Government\u2019s objectives for higher\neducation. The Governments have additional objectives regarding the activities of the University,\nbut there is no need for a direct alignment between the Governments\u2019 objectives and the University\u2019s\nobjectives.  \nAbility to use power to affect returns  \nSince it was concluded above that in the circumstances presented neither the State Government nor\nthe Australian Government has power (as described in the Standard) over the University, then the\nthird control criterion linking power and returns is also not satisfied. The Governments are able to\naffect the returns of the University, and thus their own indirect returns, through exercising their\nsubstantive rights. However, the Governments are unable to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly affect the University\u2019s returns.  \nControl conclusion  \nThe conclusion from the above assessment is that neither the State Government nor the Australian\nGovernment has power over the University and therefore neither Government controls the\nUniversity.  \nIn this case, the University would not be consolidated by any other entity. The University Council as\na group is not an investor as contemplated by the Standard. It is akin to the board of directors of a\ncompany, that is, the Council is a part of the University itself.  \n-----  ",

This means that a parent that has\nan ultimate parent or other intermediate parent that prepares non-IFRS-compliant consolidated financial\nstatements does not have access to the exemption from consolidation provided in paragraph 10 of AASB 127,\neven if the criteria in paragraphs 10(a) to 10(c) are met.  \nBC4 Similarly, investors need not apply the equity method when they meet the four criteria in paragraph 13(c) of\nAASB 128 Investments in Associates and venturers need not apply proportionate consolidation or the equity\nmethod when they meet the four criteria in paragraph 2(c) of AASB 131 _Interests in Joint Ventures. The_\ncriteria in paragraph 10 of AASB 127, paragraph 13(c) of AASB 128 and paragraph 2(c) of AASB 131 are\nsimilar.  \nBC5 Consequently, the exemptions from the equity method and proportionate consolidation are also not available\nunder those paragraphs to an investor or a venturer when its ultimate parent or intermediate parent prepares\nnon-IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements.  \nBC6 The AASB issued Exposure Draft ED 205 _Extending Relief from Consolidation, the Equity Method and_\n_Proportionate Consolidation in September 2010. The AASB considered the submissions received from_\nconstituents and confirmed the principal approach proposed in the Exposure Draft.",

        "page_content=": "## New Zealand approach  \nBC7 During its development of ED 205, the AASB noted that a related issue was considered by the Financial\nReporting Standards Board (FRSB) of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants in December\n2008. This concerned the requirement in paragraph 10(d) of NZ IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial\n_Statements that the parent\u2019s financial statements must be \u2018available for public use\u2019. Due to the reporting_\nrequirements in New Zealand, not all entities are required to file their financial statements with the Companies\nOffice. Hence, when a parent of a group is not required to submit its financial statements, any intermediate\nsubsidiaries were unable to use the paragraph 10 exemption. As a result, the FRSB inserted paragraph NZ\n3.1 into NZ IAS 27 so that entities that qualify for differential reporting concessions were not required to\ncomply with paragraph 10(d). In order to qualify for the exemption not to present consolidated financial\nstatements, qualifying entities were still required to comply with all the other conditions in paragraph 10.  \nBC8 In addition, the AASB noted that the FRSB had inserted a similar exemption into NZ IAS 28 Investments in\n_Associates (paragraph NZ 1.2) and NZ IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (paragraph NZ 1.1), extending the_\nrelief from application of the equity method by investors and proportionate consolidation or the equity method\nby venturers.  \nBC9 The AASB did not follow the FRSB\u2019s specific approach for qualifying entities, given the different issues\nfaced by the two Boards and the different financial reporting framework in New Zealand, including its  \n-----  differential reporting framework that involves modifications to the recognition and measurement\nrequirements of IFRSs.",

However,\nthe AASB decided that such relief should not be available in relation to the General Government Sector (GGS)\nof each Federal, State and Territory Government due to the unique circumstances related to the GGS, its\nrelationship to the whole of government and its macro-economic significance. The AASB also decided that\nthe partial consolidation basis for GGS financial statements required by AASB 1049 Whole of Government\n_and General Government Sector Financial Reporting would not be amended._  \nBC12 Consistent with IAS 27, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, the AASB\ndecided that the existing relief provided under paragraph 10 of AASB 127, paragraph 13(c) of AASB 128\nand paragraph 2(c) of AASB 131 should be retained. The extension of relief on the basis set out in paragraph\nBC10 does not change the present requirements for relief when the ultimate or intermediate parent is a forprofit Tier 1 entity \u2013 that entity is still required to prepare IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements.",

Extending relief to\nthe for-profit Tier 1 parent, investor or venturer in this case would be beyond the scope of the relief available\nunder IFRSs. However, the relief is available when the not-for-profit entity is not required to apply such\ninconsistent requirements. This is indicated by footnote to the table in paragraph AG1 of the Australian\napplication guidance added to AASB 127. In this case, the for-profit Tier 1 entity would be able to claim\ncompliance with IFRSs in that the relief is within the scope of the relief available under IFRSs.  \nBC14 The AASB considered the extension of relief to a for-profit Tier 2 parent, investor or venturer that has a notfor-profit ultimate or intermediate parent. The table in the Basis for Conclusions in ED 205 proposed that\nrelief should be available to a parent, investor or venturer in these circumstances, which appears to be\ninconsistent with the circumstances addressed in paragraph BC13.

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC2 AASB 2013-5 is the result of the AASB\u2019s due process, which began when the AASB issued Exposure Draft\nED 220 _Investment Entities (AASB ED 220) in September 2011 (incorporating International Accounting_\nStandards Board [IASB] ED/2011/4 Investment Entities). That Exposure Draft proposed that an investment\nentity be required to account for investees that it controls at fair value through profit or loss, rather than\nconsolidate them.  \nBC3 In the material accompanying ED 220, AASB members expressed concerns with the ED/2011/4 proposals,\nincluding:  \n(a) the exception to consolidation goes against the application of the well-established accounting\nconcept of control, which is designed to result in the presentation of all the assets, liabilities, income\nand expenses of the group, and the amendments would result in a loss of relevant information for\nusers of financial statements;  \n(b) the basis of the exception to consolidation is the type of entity, rather than the underlying\nrelationship between investors and investees; and  \n(c) there are no clear principles underpinning the classification of entities as investment entities and\nthe criteria for identifying investment entities are rule-based and open to opportunistic behaviour.  \nBC4 As evident from the responses to ED 220, views were divided among Australian constituents. Some expressed\nconcerns similar to those of the AASB members. However, others expressed broad support for requiring\nsome types of entities to account for controlled investees at fair value through profit or loss, rather than having\nthem consolidate such entities.  \nBC5 The AASB expressed its concerns in its submission to the IASB on IASB ED/2011/4.  \nBC6 In October 2012, the IASB amended IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosures of\n_Interest in Other Entities and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements for investment entities to provide an_\nexception to consolidating particular subsidiaries for investment entities, requiring them instead to measure\ntheir investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.  \nBC7 The AASB noted that its concerns with the ED/2011/4 proposals were not adequately addressed in the IASB\namendments. The AASB also considered the disclosures required by the IASB amendments and noted that\nthey require an investment entity to provide information about the exception to consolidation rather than\naddressing the loss of consolidation information that preparing a complete set of consolidated general purpose\nfinancial statements would provide.  \nBC8 Because of its concerns with the IASB amendments, the AASB decided to undertake further due process.\nAfter considering a number of different possible approaches to the recognition and measurement of controlled\ninvestees of investment entities, including (i) consolidation and (ii) fair value measurement with\ncompensating disclosures, the AASB issued ED 233 Australian Additional Disclosures \u2013 Investment Entities\nin December 2012. It proposed to introduce the exception to consolidation for investment entities (as per the\nIASB amendments) and to require Australian additional disclosures for Australian entities that meet the\nIASB\u2019s investment entity criteria. The Australian additional disclosures proposed in ED 233 were in the form\nof:  \n-  consolidated financial statements prepared in a manner consistent with the definition of\nconsolidated financial statements in Appendix A of AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;\nand  \n-  a summary of the significant accounting policies used in preparing those consolidated financial\nstatements that are not otherwise disclosed in accordance with AASB 101 Presentation of Financial\n_Statements._  \n-----  BC9 ED 233 also specifically asked respondents whether they have any alternative approaches/disclosure\nstrategies that can be employed to minimise the adverse impact on the decision-making of the loss of\nconsolidation information.  \nBC10 The AASB received 29 submissions on ED 233. The vast majority of respondents did not support the proposed\nAustralian additional disclosures. These respondents expressed support for introducing the IASB\namendments without Australian additional disclosures.  \nBC11 The AASB staff also conducted targeted outreach with users of financial statements and the limited feedback\nreceived indicated that if there were to be Australian additional disclosures required, an example of the\ninformation that would be relevant is information about the earnings and liabilities of subsidiaries of\ninvestment entities.",

        "page_content=": "## AASB deliberations on adopting the IASB amendments in Australia without Australian additional disclosures  \nBC12 The AASB considered three main approaches to introducing the IASB amendments for investment entities in\nAustralia:  \nA. issue the IASB amendments without Australian additional disclosures;  \nB. issue the IASB amendments with Australian additional disclosures as proposed in AASB ED 233;\nand  \nC. issue the IASB amendments with Australian additional disclosures that are reduced compared with\nthe ED 233 proposals, in particular, disclosures about an unconsolidated subsidiary\u2019s total assets,\ntotal liabilities and total comprehensive income.  \nBC13 The AASB considered and rejected the approach of not adopting the IASB\u2019s amendments for Australian\ninvestment entities as this would result in Australian investment entities not being able to assert IFRS\ncompliance, an outcome that would be contrary to the AASB\u2019s policy of having \u201c\u2026 Tier 1 for-profit entities\nbeing IFRS compliant\u201d[2].  \nBC14 The majority of AASB members expressed a preference for, or could at least accept, Approach A, consistent\nwith the AASB\u2019s policy of IFRS adoption. Some members consider that the fair value of controlled entities\ncan arguably be regarded as more relevant for users of financial statements of investment entities than\nconsolidation information. Some other members consider that the IASB\u2019s criteria for determining investment\nentities lack rigour and could lead to inconsistent application. However, on balance, the majority of members\nare willing to accept, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the IASB amendments, including the\ndisclosures required of investment entities in accordance with IFRS 12, would be sufficient to meet the needs\nof users of financial statements of investment entities, consistent with the feedback received from the vast\nmajority of the respondents to ED 233.  \nBC15 This majority of AASB members could not accept Approach C as there was insufficient feedback from users\nto suggest that the reduced disclosures proposed in Approach C would be useful. Those AASB members did\nnot think it appropriate to delay adoption while further input from users is sought.  \nBC16 The AASB noted the wide range of arguments put forward by respondents to ED 233 for favouring Approach\nA including the view that fair value information is most relevant for investors of investment entities in many\ncircumstances; and the cost to Australian preparers of financial statements compared with other jurisdictions\nof providing Australian additional disclosures . However, despite accepting Approach A, the AASB did not\naccept all of those arguments. In particular, the AASB did not accept the arguments that requiring Australian\nadditional disclosures would reduce comparability (as distinct from uniformity) between Australian\ninvestment entities and their international counterparts or would lead to the perception that Australian\ninvestment entities are not IFRS compliant.  \nBC17 On balance, the AASB decided to adopt Approach A. This was on the basis that the AASB would monitor\nthe implementation of the IASB amendments for Australian investment entities. This would include\nmonitoring the disclosures made in accordance with AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and\nAASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements paragraph 17(c)[3]. Such monitoring, which may be via a postimplementation review, would be undertaken with a view to potentially adding Australian additional\ndisclosure requirements at a later stage, if it were to become evident that additional disclosures are warranted,\nnoting that such disclosures might be different from those proposed in ED 233 or Approach C. Monitoring  \n2 AASB Policy Statement Policies and Processes March 2011, paragraph 7\n3 AASB 101 paragraph 17(c) requires an entity to provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in  \nAustralian Accounting Standards is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and\nconditions on the entity\u2019s financial position and financial performance.  \n-----  might also lead to the AASB deciding to write to the IASB, informing it of the findings and concerns arising\nfrom the Australian experience.",

        "page_content=": "## Dissenting views  \nDissent of Peter Gibson, Jayne Godfrey, John O\u2019Grady and Kevin M. Stevenson  \nDO1 In our opinion the exception to consolidation for investment entities that requires controlled investees to be\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss rather than being consolidated is a violation of the basic principle\nthat an entity should account for all of its assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  \nDO2 At the most fundamental level we do not see the provision of fair value information for investments as a\nsubstitute for, or an alternative to, consolidated information. Without the detailed consideration of that part\nof the financial position and financial performance of an entity represented by its controlled entities, fair value\nmovements would not be sufficient for decision-making and offset too much information into a single line\nitem.  \nDO3 We regard the exception as fundamentally based on a view that an entity\u2019s business model should determine\naccounting treatments. However, we do not believe that an entity\u2019s business model should drive how it\naccounts for its controlled investees. In our opinion, the business model approach and the IASB\u2019s criteria for\ndetermining investment entities, which we believe lack rigour, will lead to uncertainty in application and\ninconsistency of reporting between similar entities. This approach also has the potential to promote\nstructuring opportunities to avoid consolidation. In turn, this would be to the detriment of providing useful,\ncomparable information to users of financial statements.  \nDO4 We believe that providing exceptions to principles further complicates accounting, introduces unjustified\ncomplexity to financial statements and reduces comparability of entities\u2019 financial reports across sectors. It\nalso creates a precedent for further, less rigorous standard-setting.  \n-----  DO5 For Australia, the exception to consolidation would require de-consolidation of controlled entities when\nAustralia has been well-served by the control principle and has been relatively free of criticism of off-balancesheet accounting.  \nDO6 Additionally, we have not heard from users of financial statements of investment entities in Australia that\nconsolidation information is not useful or relevant for decision-making.  \nDO7 Furthermore, if the fair values of controlled investments held by investment entities are relevant, we are of\nthe view that they could be provided as supplementary disclosures in financial statements, consistent with the\ndisclosure requirements in AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures for financial instruments with carrying\namounts that differ from their fair value.  \n-----  ",

Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors\nthan to others.  \nBC2 Before finalising the implementation guidance set out in this Standard, the Board issued Exposure Draft\nED 238 Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Australian Implementation Guidance for Not-for-Profit Entities\nin March 2013. ED 238 proposed for public comment implementation guidance for not-for-profit entities in\nrespect of both AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other\n_Entities. The Board considered the submissions received in response to ED 238 in deciding the_\nimplementation guidance to be added to those Standards.  \nBC3 In the process of developing the proposals in ED 238, the Board commissioned research into the\nimplementation issues that had been encountered by not-for-profit entities in applying the notion of control\n(and related public sector guidance) in the superseded Accounting Standard AASB 127 _Consolidated and_\n_Separate Financial Statements. Discussions were also held with constituents experienced in not-for-profit_\npublic sector and private sector financial reporting, to ascertain implementation issues that might be\nencountered in applying AASB 10 (which replaces AASB 127, in part) in a not-for-profit context. Based on\nthe research findings and the nature of many of the issues identified, the Board concluded that the principles\nin AASB 10 could be applied in a not-for-profit context, albeit using professional judgement, and that certain\naspects of those principles and the terminology adopted warranted specific implementation guidance for notfor-profit entities.  \nBC4 In addition, the Board noted that some of the issues identified through the research are fundamental to the\nnotion of control and therefore beyond the scope of AASB 10. These issues include:  \n(a) the nature of government departments as reporting entities;  \n(b) the role that disclosure of disaggregated information in whole of government financial reports\nmight play in providing relevant information to users; and  \n(c) control of assets.  \nBC5 The Board concluded that, because they are beyond the scope of AASB 10 and would not impede the\napplication of AASB 10 by not-for-profit entities, these issues do not need to be addressed prior to clarifying\nfor not-for-profit entities the application of the notion of control in AASB 10. The Board noted that this\napproach is consistent with its policy of transaction neutrality. Accordingly, the Board decided to progress\nits Control in the Not-for-Profit Public and Private Sectors project in stages. The first stage, completed by\nthe issue of this Standard, is intended to clarify the application of AASB 10 (and AASB 12) in a not-for-profit\ncontext. It is expected that later stages will address the associated fundamental issues noted above.  \nBC6 The Board also noted the current project of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board\n(IPSASB) to update its consolidation, joint ventures and associates Standards for the issuance of IFRS 10\n_Consolidated Financial Statements and its related IFRSs. The IPSASB published its Exposure Drafts in_\nOctober 2013, but the AASB decided to finalise the implementation guidance for AASB 10 and AASB 12,\nhaving considered the decisions of the IPSASB as it developed its Exposure Drafts.  \nBC7 Since the implementation guidance does not change or depart from the principles in AASB 10, the types of\nharmonisation differences between AASB 10 and the ABS GFS Manual are not affected by the guidance.\nAccordingly, pre-existing GAAP/GFS differences were not addressed in ED 238.  \nBC8 The remainder of this Basis for Conclusions outlines the basis for the Board\u2019s decisions relating to the first\nstage of the project.  \n-----  ",

As the implementation\nguidance neither amends the requirements nor adds new requirements for not-for-profit entities, the Board\ndecided that the guidance should not be presented as Aus paragraphs within the body of AASB 10. However,\nthe Board decided to include one Aus paragraph in the body of the Standard as a signpost to the\nimplementation guidance.  \nBC10 The Board then considered whether the guidance should be presented as Aus paragraphs located throughout\nthe existing Application Guidance (Appendix B to AASB 10) or as a separate attachment to AASB 10. As\nAppendix B is integral to AASB 10 and therefore has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard,\nAus paragraphs in Appendix B should also be limited to those that either amend the requirements in AASB\n10 or add new requirements. Accordingly, the Board applied the same approach as stated in paragraph BC9\nand decided to add the not-for-profit entity implementation guidance to AASB 10 as an attachment rather\nthan as Aus paragraphs within Appendix B.  \nBC11 The implementation guidance is attached to AASB 10 as Appendix E. The Appendix is integral to the\nStandard and thus has the same authority as the body and other appendices of the Standard. The Board\nconsidered whether the guidance should merely accompany, and not be part of, AASB 10. To facilitate the\nguidance being applied consistently by not-for-profit entities, the Board decided to make the guidance integral\nto AASB 10.  \nBC12 The Appendix added to AASB 10 is labelled as Appendix E, to be consistent with the labelling of the\nappendices to IFRS 10 _Consolidated Financial Statements. In IFRS 10, Appendix D consists of the_\nconsequential amendments to other Standards and Interpretations arising from the issuance of IFRS 10.\nAASB 10 does not have any Appendix D since those consequential amendments were made in AASB 2011-7\n_Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Consolidation and Joint Arrangements_\n_Standards (August 2011), following the Board\u2019s practice of making amendments via separate Standards_\nrather than through appendices to Standards.",

For example,\nthe guidance addresses rights arising from statutory arrangements (paragraphs IG6\u2013IG7), economic\ndependence (paragraphs IG11\u2013IG12), regulatory powers (paragraphs IG16\u2013IG17), indirect returns (or\nbenefits) to not-for-profit entities and congruent objectives (paragraphs IG18\u2013IG20), and delegated power\n(paragraphs IG21\u2013IG24).  \nBC15 The Board did not include implementation guidance in respect of some topics covered by AASB 10 due to\nthe Board\u2019s assessment that the issues arise similarly for both for-profit entities and not-for-profit entities.\nFor example, the requirements regarding de facto agents and control of specified assets raise issues in practice\nfor any entity, not just not-for-profit entities.  \n-----  ",

        "page_content=": "### Examples\nBC16 To illustrate the requirements of AASB 10, the implementation guidance includes examples within guidance\nparagraphs as well as five discrete, comprehensive examples. The examples refer to particular types of notfor-profit entities, some in the private sector and others in the public sector. However, the Board intended\nthat the examples apply by analogy to other types of not-for-profit entities and similar circumstances as\nrelevant, rather than being limited to the specific cases presented.  \nBC17 The comprehensive examples emphasise a principles-based approach, which requires an analysis of the\nrelevant activities of the investee and of the substantive rights of various investors in considering whether the\ninvestor has power (as that term is used in AASB 10) over the investee. The Board noted that it could be\ndifficult to distinguish substantive rights from protective rights held by an investor in relation to an investee.\nTherefore, the Board decided to note in the introduction to the comprehensive examples that distinguishing\nsubstantive and protective rights requires analysis of the circumstances, including considering the reasons for\ndifferent investors holding various rights in relation to the investee. The Board also decided to include a\nrange of scenarios in most of the comprehensive examples to illustrate that alternative outcomes for the\nassessment of control by the investor reflect the facts and circumstances in any particular case.  \nBC18 The Board included specific comprehensive examples in respect of a local government (Example IG3) and a\nuniversity (Example IG4), given the anticipated uncertainty in respect of how AASB 10 might apply in\ndetermining whether such entities are controlled by another entity. Two scenarios under which different\ncontrol conclusions might be drawn are presented in the university example, whereas the local government\nexample includes only one case, in which it is concluded that the local government is not controlled by another\ngovernment. The Board took the view that this would be the normal outcome in relation to local governments\nunder current arrangements in Australia, but noted in paragraph IG8 and at the end of Example IG3 that the\nassessment of whether a local government is controlled by another government would depend on the\nparticular facts and circumstances.  \nBC19 Given the types of arrangements often found in the public sector, the Board also decided that an example\nconcerning delegated powers and agency relationships affecting public sector entities would be useful\nguidance. Example IG5 presents two scenarios regarding whether a government department controls a\nstatutory authority. The example might be relevant in some jurisdictions but not in others.",

        "page_content=": "### Former guidance in superseded AASB 127\nBC20 The Board reviewed the specific public sector guidance in the superseded AASB 127 _Consolidated and_\n_Separate Financial Statements (paragraphs Aus17.1\u2013Aus17.10) in the context of the three criteria for control_\nset out in AASB 10: power, returns, and a link between power and returns. Some of the guidance in the\nsuperseded AASB 127 was not incorporated into Appendix E, on the grounds that the Board considered that\nit was either inconsistent with or beyond the scope of the requirements of AASB 10 or no longer necessary.\nThe following paragraphs address the major aspects of the guidance in the superseded AASB 127.  \nBC21 Paragraph Aus17.1 stated that AASB 127 did not attempt to identify all groups and reporting entities in the\npublic sector. Nevertheless, paragraph Aus17.5 described the nature of some reporting entities in the public\nsector. Paragraph Aus17.7 also discussed identifying economic entities in relation to Ministerial portfolios\nand functions with separate objectives. The Board decided that it was not appropriate to include these general\nstatements in the implementation guidance since the nature of reporting entities in the public sector is a\nfundamental issue beyond the scope of AASB 10 (see paragraph BC4).  \nBC22 The statement in paragraph Aus17.2 that control of an entity by the government may be indicated by the\naccountability of the entity to the Parliament (or the Executive or a Minister) and by the government holding\nthe residual financial interest in the net assets of the entity has not been incorporated into the implementation\nguidance. Accountability to the Parliament, the Executive or a Minister might or might not indicate that the\ngovernment has substantive rights in relation to the entity, so the power criterion might not be satisfied.\nHolding the residual financial interest in the entity shows that the government has exposure or rights to\nvariable returns from the entity, but does not indicate whether the government has the ability to use power\nover the entity to affect the government\u2019s returns. Consequently, these two factors are insufficient to conclude\nwhether an entity is controlled by the government.  \nBC23 Paragraph Aus17.3 listed circumstances that, individually or in combination, indicate that an entity is\naccountable to Parliament, the Executive or a Minister. The circumstances listed in paragraphs Aus17.3(a)\u2013\n(d) are addressed in paragraphs B15 and IG9 in terms of rights that can give an investor power in relation to\nan investee. However, paragraph Aus17.3(e) has not been included in the implementation guidance because\na requirement to submit reports to Parliament might reflect either protective or substantive rights, and hence\nis not useful as an indicator of power. Paragraph Aus17.3(f) regarding an entity established through\nlegislation has been updated and included in paragraph IG7.  \n-----  BC24 Paragraph Aus17.4 listed circumstances that indicate whether a government has a residual financial interest\nin the net assets of another entity. These circumstances (exposure to residual liabilities and the right to receive\nresidual net assets on dissolution of the entity) indicate that the government would be exposed to variable\nreturns from the entity. These returns are covered by the investment returns noted in paragraph B57(a).  \nBC25 Paragraph Aus17.6 stated that a government will usually control statutory authorities that it has established\nthrough legislation. This circumstance has been addressed through paragraph IG7 in respect of whether the\ngovernment has power over an entity established through legislation. Power is just one of the control criteria.  \nBC26 Restrictions on the allocation of funds between activities and the existence of separate administrations are\nlisted in paragraph Aus17.7 as factors that may affect the ability of an entity to deploy resources and should\nbe considered in determining the existence of a group in the public sector. The ability to deploy resources is\nrelevant to assessing whether an investor has power over an investee (see paragraph IG5). Restrictions on\nthe ability to deploy resources may reflect barriers that prevent the holder of rights from exercising them.\nExamples of barriers are listed in paragraph B23, including operational barriers and legal or regulatory\nrequirements.  \nBC27 Paragraph Aus17.8 noted that for a government to control an entity, it must have the power to require the\nentity\u2019s assets to be deployed towards achieving the government\u2019s objectives, and listed various actions that\nthe government might be able to direct in respect of the controlled entity\u2019s assets. Whether these\ncircumstances result in the government controlling the entity under AASB 10 would depend on whether the\ngovernment has power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. The actions listed are broadly consistent\nwith the activities listed in paragraph B11 that can be relevant activities of an investee, depending on the\ncircumstances of the investee.  \nBC28 Paragraph Aus17.9 outlined a range of circumstances in which a government does not control another entity,\nsuch as an entity dependent on government funding but able to decide whether to accept resources from the\ngovernment and how to use the resources (paragraphs Aus17.9(a) and (c)). These examples are no longer\nneeded as paragraphs IG11 and IG12 concerning economic dependence and paragraph IG20 in respect of\ncongruent objectives adequately address the issues.  \nBC29 Paragraph Aus17.9(b) stated that a government acting as the trustee of a trust would not control the trust as it\nwould not be able to deploy the resources of the trust for its own benefit. In contrast, the implementation\nguidance includes an example of a trust that is controlled through the trustee (paragraph IG22). Under\nAASB 10, the investor\u2019s returns from a trust may be indirect non-financial returns, which the former guidance\ndid not acknowledge.  \nBC30 Regulatory powers were addressed in paragraph Aus17.9(d) as not giving rise to control of regulated entities.\nParagraph IG16 states that regulatory powers may represent either substantive rights (which could result in\ncontrol of regulated entities) or protective rights (which would not result in control). Examples of protective\nrights are included in paragraph IG17.  \nBC31 Paragraph Aus17.9(e) stated that under existing legislative arrangements, State and Territory governments do\nnot control local governments. The Board reconsidered the question of control of local governments but did\nnot reach a categoric view. As noted in paragraph BC18, the Board concluded that although a local\ngovernment normally would not be controlled by another government under current arrangements, the\nassessment of whether a local government is controlled by another government would depend on the\nparticular facts and circumstances (paragraph IG8). Example IG3 illustrates how a decision as to whether a\nlocal government is controlled by another government could be addressed.  \nBC32 The final paragraph in the former public sector guidance, paragraph Aus17.10, addressed government control\nof independent statutory offices such as auditors-general and the judiciary. The same examples have been\nincorporated into the implementation guidance in paragraph IG10, which addresses more particularly the\norganisations assisting the independent statutory office holders.",

As AASB 12 applies to not-for-profit entities in conjunction with AASB 10, the Board included\nthe proposals in the same Exposure Draft (ED 238).  \nBC34 After considering the submissions received on the ED, the Board decided to add implementation guidance as\nAppendix E to AASB 12, integral to the Standard and thus with the same authority as the body and other\nappendices of the Standard. These decisions reflect the decisions on the nature and location of guidance as\nset out in paragraphs BC9\u2013BC12 in respect of the AASB 10 guidance.  \n-----  BC35 The Board decided that the implementation guidance for AASB 12 should be based on the principle\nunderlying the definition of structured entity, and identified that principle as limiting the scope of structured\nentities to entities that are controlled through less conventional means. This is based on the definition\nemphasising that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls a structured\nentity \u2013 and for for-profit entities, voting rights are a common or conventional means of determining control.  \nBC36 The Board identified administrative arrangements and statutory provisions (legislation) as common means by\nwhich control may be determined for many not-for-profit entities, particularly those in the public sector.\nAccordingly, the Board took the view that the reference to \u2018similar rights\u2019 in the definition of structured entity\nencompasses, for not-for-profit entities, administrative arrangements and statutory provisions. Thus, not-forprofit entities for which administrative arrangements or statutory provisions are dominant factors in\ndetermining control of the entity are not regarded as structured entities.

The Board agreed that the relevant\nactivities of the investee should be addressed clearly, since an investor can have power over an investee only\nwhen it has substantive rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee.\nThe examples were amended accordingly, including addressing the control criteria more directly.\nNevertheless, the Board retained the substantive and protective rights details in the examples, albeit with\nsome reclassification, as part of the background information for the examples.  \nBC42 Of the four major examples proposed in the ED, three related specifically to public sector entities (local\ngovernments, universities, and government departments and authorities) and one to not-for-profit private\nsector entities (a religious organisation and an association). Some respondents requested additional not-forprofit private sector examples. The Board added a further major example (Example IG2) based on not-forprofit private sector entities (a charity and a company) and illustrating four scenarios. As stated in paragraph\nBC16, the Board also decided to note in the implementation guidance that the illustrative examples apply by\nanalogy to types of not-for-profit entities other than those specifically identified in the examples and similar\ncircumstances, as relevant (see paragraph IG3).  \nBC43 The ED proposed that rights specified in substantively enacted legislation could not give an investor the\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities of an investee. This was questioned by some respondents, who\ncompared substantive enactment of substantive rights with substantive rights that were exercisable only in  \n-----  the future. The Board reconsidered the issue and decided to change the guidance to acknowledge that in\nlimited circumstances rights under substantively enacted legislation could become exercisable in time for\nmaking decisions about an investee\u2019s relevant activities. For example, the progression from substantively\nenacted legislation to enacted legislation may be merely a matter of the formal approval of the legislation by\nthe Governor in Council within a limited timeframe.  \nBC44 Several respondents questioned whether the notion of delegation in the not-for-profit public sector was\nadequately reflected in the proposed example illustrating whether a government department controlled a\nstatutory authority. The Board revised the example and paragraph IG24 to clarify that a delegate in the notfor-profit public sector is not an agent of the delegator. The Board also deleted references to \u2018delegated\ncontrol\u2019 as it was not necessary to introduce a new term. The Board noted that the term \u2018delegation\u2019 has a\nnarrower meaning in the not-for-profit public sector than its general usage in the Standard to denote an\nagent/principal relationship.",

        "page_content=": "## Issues raised but guidance not revised  \nBC45 The Board discussed a range of issues raised by respondents to ED 238 that did not lead to changes to the\nimplementation guidance that had been proposed in the ED. The more significant such issues included\nrequests for guidance concerning assessing the relative significance of the rights of different parties, a\ncontrolled local government scenario, collective control in the public sector, and the effect of removal rights\nin the public sector, and comments on the power to enact or change legislation.  \nBC46 Respondents noted the difficulty in many cases of identifying which investor has power over an investee\nwhen more than one investor is able to direct different relevant activities of the investee. The Board was\nasked to provide further guidance on how to identify which investor was able to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly affected the investee\u2019s returns. The Board concluded that it was not feasible to provide guidance\nfor weighing the relative significance of different relevant activities since this would be subject to judgement\nin the context of the facts and circumstances in any particular case.  \nBC47 Some respondents to ED 238 noted that, unlike the other comprehensive examples, the local government\nexample did not include an alternative scenario. The only scenario illustrated concluded that in the\ncircumstances presented the local government was not controlled by the State government. Some respondents\nsuggested that if it was not possible for a local government to be controlled by another government, then the\nguidance should state that. Other respondents suggested the addition of an alternative scenario so that the\nalternative control outcome would not be overlooked when the guidance was being applied. The Board\ndecided that an alternative scenario was not required, since the proposed example already referred to the\npossibility of an alternative outcome (ie the local government being controlled by another government) in\ndifferent circumstances or based on different judgements. The proposed implementation guidance also\nindicated that the assessment of whether a local government is controlled by another government would\ndepend on the particular facts and circumstances. As noted in paragraph BC18, this approach has been\nretained in the implementation guidance.  \nBC48 The Board considered whether to extend the proposed example concerning whether a department controlled\na statutory authority to address so-called collective rights at a whole of government level, under which a\nparticular entity would be consolidated in the whole of government financial statements despite no individual\nentity or Minister in the jurisdiction being considered to control the particular entity. The Board decided not\nto extend the example on the basis that judgement would be required to determine in the circumstances\nwhether the collective rights amounted to control at the whole of government level, with or without joint\ncontrol by entities in the jurisdiction, or some other outcome.  \nBC49 The Board was asked to provide guidance regarding the implications of removal rights since, in the public\nsector, a government or a Minister will often have the right to dismiss key executives of public sector entities,\nsuch as the head of a department. The Board noted that the AASB 10 requirements relating to agency\nrelationships and removal rights might be interpreted to imply that the key executives or their organisations\nact only as an agent of the government or Minister and therefore would be unable to control other entities.\nHowever, the Board considers that the requirements do not prevent intermediate parent entities from\ncontrolling other entities or preparing consolidated financial statements. For example, a department head is\na part of the department, and a Minister\u2019s ability to remove the department head does not prevent the\ndepartment from being able to control other entities. The Board concluded that specific implementation\nguidance was not required.  \nBC50 Some respondents questioned the position proposed in the ED that the power to enact or change legislation\ncould not give an investor the current ability to direct the relevant activities of an investee. The Board\naffirmed this view for the implementation guidance (paragraph IG14). If the power to legislate were relevant\nto determining whether a government controlled other entities, then, subject to the constitutional reach of its\npowers, the government might be considered to control all of the entities in its jurisdiction (including private  \n-----  sector entities) since it could conceivably cause Parliament to pass legislation to enable it to direct the\nactivities of any or all of those entities so as to achieve its economic and social objectives. However, the\npolitical and social barriers (see paragraph IG13) to passing such legislation mean that the government\nrealistically would not have the ability to exercise such power, and thus the power would not represent\nsubstantive rights.",

For example, under joint reporting, two or more registered entities may be permitted to prepare\nand lodge a single financial report, which might or might not be consistent with the AASB 10 requirements\nfor consolidated financial statements. Collective reporting would not be consistent with AASB 10.  \nBC53 The Board also noted that section 60.30 of the ACNC Regulation requires a registered entity to prepare a\nspecial purpose financial statement, if it is not required to and does not propose to prepare a general purpose\nfinancial statement. The Board\u2019s focus in setting accounting standards is on general purpose financial\nstatements rather than special purpose financial statements.  \nBC54 The Board acknowledges that regulators might impose financial reporting requirements that differ from\nAASB Standards for their own regulatory purposes. The Board noted that the ACNC requirements would be\nexpected to coincide with AASB Accounting Standards in most cases. However, the ACNC may permit\nregistered entities to depart from AASB 10 in limited circumstances. The Board decided that it would not be\nappropriate for its requirements for general purpose financial statements to reflect those limited\ncircumstances.  \n-----  ",
