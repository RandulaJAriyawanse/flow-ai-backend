For AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is\ndefined in AASB 1057 _Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of_\nAccounting Concepts SAC 1 _Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities_\napplying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of\nthe Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF paragraphs or footnotes.  \n2 In meeting this objective, the Standard requires:  \n(a) limited changes to the accounting policies that were applied in accordance with previous\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (previous GAAP) for regulatory deferral account\nbalances, which are primarily related to the presentation of these accounts; and  \n(b) disclosures that:  \n(i) identify and explain the amounts recognised in the entity\u2019s financial statements that\narise from rate regulation; and  \n(ii) help users of the financial statements to understand the amount, timing and uncertainty\nof future cash flows from any regulatory deferral account balances that are recognised.  \n3 The requirements of this Standard permit an entity within its scope to continue to account for regulatory\ndeferral account balances in its financial statements in accordance with its previous GAAP when it adopts\nAustralian Accounting Standards, subject to the limited changes referred to in paragraph 2 above.  \n4 In addition, this Standard provides some exceptions to, or exemptions from, the requirements of other\nStandards. All specified requirements for reporting regulatory deferral account balances, and any exceptions\nto, or exemptions from, the requirements of other Standards that are related to those balances, are contained\nwithin this Standard instead of within those other Standards.",

        "page_content=": "## Continuation of existing accounting policies  \nB3 For the purposes of this Standard, a regulatory deferral account balance is defined as the balance of any\nexpense (or income) account that would not be recognised as an asset or a liability in accordance with other\nStandards, but that qualifies for deferral because it is included, or is expected to be included, by the rate\nregulator in establishing the rate(s) that can be charged to customers. Some items of expense (income) may\nbe outside the regulated rate(s) because, for example, the amounts are not expected to be accepted by the\nrate regulator or because they are not within the scope of the rate regulation. Consequently, such an item is\nrecognised as income or expense as incurred, unless another Standard permits or requires it to be included\nin the carrying amount of an asset or liability.  \nB4 In some cases, other Standards explicitly prohibit an entity from recognising, in the statement of financial\nposition, regulatory deferral account balances that might be recognised, either separately or included within\nother line items such as property, plant and equipment in accordance with previous GAAP accounting\npolicies. However, in accordance with paragraph 11 of this Standard, an entity that elects to apply this\nStandard in its first Australian-Accounting-Standards financial statements applies the exemption from\nparagraph 11 of AASB 108 in order to continue to apply its previous GAAP accounting policies for the\nrecognition, measurement, impairment, and derecognition of regulatory deferral account balances. Such\naccounting policies may include, for example, the following practices:  \n(a) recognising a regulatory deferral account debit balance when the entity has the right, as a result of\nthe actual or expected actions of the rate regulator, to increase rates in future periods in order to\nrecover its allowable costs (ie the costs for which the regulated rate(s) is intended to provide\nrecovery);  \n(b) recognising, as a regulatory deferral account debit or credit balance, an amount that is equivalent\nto any loss or gain on the disposal or retirement of both items of property, plant and equipment\nand of intangible assets, which is expected to be recovered or reversed through future rates;  \n(c) recognising a regulatory deferral account credit balance when the entity is required, as a result of\nthe actual or expected actions of the rate regulator, to decrease rates in future periods in order to\nreverse over-recoveries of allowable costs (ie amounts in excess of the recoverable amount\nspecified by the rate regulator); and  \n(d) measuring regulatory deferral account balances on an undiscounted basis or on a discounted basis\nthat uses an interest or discount rate specified by the rate regulator.  \nB5 The following are examples of the types of costs that rate regulators might allow in rate-setting decisions\nand that an entity might, therefore, recognise in regulatory deferral account balances:  \n-----  (i) volume or purchase price variances;  \n(ii) costs of approved \u2018green energy\u2019 initiatives (in excess of amounts that are capitalised as part of\nthe cost of property, plant and equipment in accordance with AASB 116 _Property, Plant and_\n_Equipment);_  \n(iii) non-directly-attributable overhead costs that are treated as capital costs for rate regulation\npurposes (but are not permitted, in accordance with AASB 116, to be included in the cost of an\nitem of property, plant and equipment);  \n(iv) project cancellation costs;  \n(v) storm damage costs; and  \n(vi) deemed interest (including amounts allowed for funds that are used during construction that\nprovide the entity with a return on the owner\u2019s equity capital as well as borrowings).  \nB6 Regulatory deferral account balances usually represent timing differences between the recognition of items\nof income or expenses for regulatory purposes and the recognition of those items for financial reporting\npurposes. When an entity changes an accounting policy on the first-time adoption of Australian Accounting\nStandards or on the initial application of a new or revised Standard, new or revised timing differences may\narise that create new or revised regulatory deferral account balances. The prohibition in paragraph 13 that\nprevents an entity from changing its accounting policy in order to start to recognise regulatory deferral\naccount balances does not prohibit the recognition of the new or revised regulatory deferral account\nbalances that are created because of other changes in accounting policies required by Australian Accounting\nStandards. This is because the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances for such timing\ndifferences would be consistent with the existing recognition policy applied in accordance with paragraph\n11 and would not represent the introduction of a new accounting policy. Similarly, paragraph 13 does not\nprohibit the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances arising from timing differences that did not\nexist immediately prior to the date of transition to Australian Accounting Standards but are consistent with\nthe entity\u2019s accounting policies established in accordance with paragraph 11 (for example, storm damage\ncosts).",

        "page_content=": "## Background  \nBC1 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (AASB)\nconsiderations in issuing AASB 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts. Individual Board members gave greater\nweight to some factors than to others.  \n## Background  \nBC2 AASB 14 is the result of the AASB\u2019s due process, which began when the AASB issued Exposure Draft\nED 240 _Regulatory Deferral Accounts (AASB ED 240) in May 2013 (incorporating International_\nAccounting Standards Board [IASB] ED/2013/5 _Regulatory Deferral Accounts). That Exposure Draft_\nproposed an interim Standard to permit first-time adopters of Australian Accounting Standards  \n[International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)] to continue to account for regulatory deferral account\nbalances in their financial statements in accordance with their previous GAAP. The proposed interim\nstandard was not intended, in any way, to anticipate the outcome of the IASB\u2019s longer term Rate-regulated\nActivities project.  \nBC3 In the Preface to ED 240, the AASB expressed the view that it did not expect the proposed interim standard,\nif it were to be incorporated into Australian Accounting Standards, would have a significant impact on\nentities in Australia as the Standard could conceivably only affect entities that adopt Australian Accounting\nStandards for the first time and have recognised regulatory deferral account balances under their previous\nGAAP.  \nBC4 The AASB received two comment letters on ED 240, which expressed broad support for issuing the interim\nstandard, acknowledging that it would be an interim measure while the IASB develops a Discussion Paper\nunder its comprehensive Rate-regulated Activities project. One respondent expressed the view that they\nwere not aware of any entities in Australia whose financial statements would be directly impacted by the\nproposals in ED 240.  \nBC5 In its comment letter to the IASB on ED/2013/5, the AASB raised the following key concerns:  \n(a) the proposals could result in the IASB inappropriately setting a precedent of introducing\nadditional interim standards for first-time adopters of IFRS to encourage transition to IFRS; and  \n(b) the proposals would reduce comparability between first-time adopters of IFRS that choose to\napply the proposals and those that already apply IFRS or first-time adopters of IFRS that do\nnot elect to apply the proposals.  \nBC6 In January 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 14 _Regulatory Deferral Accounts (incorporating the proposals in_\nED/2013/5 without substantive changes) for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016,\nwith early application permitted. The AASB noted that its concerns with the ED/2013/5 proposals,\nexpressed in its submission to the IASB, were not addressed in IFRS 14.  \nBC7 After further considering the types of entities that might be affected by the requirements of AASB 14\n(including a newly listed rate-regulated entity from a foreign jurisdiction and a foreign rate-regulated entity\nthat \u2018back door\u2019 lists in Australia), the AASB expects that the practical impact of adopting AASB 14 in\nAustralia would be minimal.  \nBC8 The AASB noted that its concerns (see paragraph BC5 above) are not so great as to cause it to make a\ndecision that would be seen as not adopting IFRS more broadly. Accordingly, given the interim nature of\nIFRS 14 (and therefore AASB 14) and the expected practical impact of AASB 14, consistent with its policy\nof adopting IFRS in Australia, the AASB decided to issue AASB 14 on the basis that to do so would not be\ncontrary to the best interests of the Australian economy.  \nBC9 The AASB also noted that, currently under AASB 1 _First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting_\n_Standards, if a first-time adopter recognises property, plant and equipment or intangible assets used in rate-_\nregulated activities and the carrying amounts of such items include amounts determined under the entity\u2019s\nprevious GAAP that do not qualify for capitalisation in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards,\nthe first-time adopter may elect to use its previous GAAP carrying amount of such items at the date of\ntransition to Australian Accounting Standards as deemed cost (paragraph D8B of AASB 1). A similar\nexemption is also available to a first-time adopter with oil and gas properties, whereby the entity may elect  \n-----  to account for its exploration and evaluation assets at the amount determined under the entity\u2019s previous\nGAAP on transition to Australian Accounting Standards (paragraph D8A of AASB 1). The AASB\nconsidered that the exemption in AASB 14 that would permit first-time adopters to continue to account for\namounts related to rate regulation in accordance with their previous GAAP when they first-time adopt\nAustralian Accounting Standards is somewhat similar to these exemptions in AASB 1. Therefore, AASB 14\nwould be broadly consistent with the approach taken by the AASB to allowing first-time adopters to\n\u2018grandfather\u2019 previous GAAP when transitioning to Australian Accounting Standards.  \n-----  ",
