This compiled version of AASB 2 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. It incorporates relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 20 December 2021 (see Compilation Details).\n\n# Accounting Standard AASB 2 Share-based Payment\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of this Standard is to specify the financial reporting by an entity when it undertakes a share-based payment transaction. In particular, it requires an entity to reflect in its profit or loss and financial position the effects of share-based payment transactions, including expenses associated with transactions in which share options are granted to employees.\n\nAusCF1\n\nAusCF paragraphs and footnotes included in this Standard apply only to:\n\n- (a) not-for-profit entities; and\n- (b) for-profit entities that are not applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards).\n\nSuch entities are referred to as \u2018AusCF entities\u2019. For AusCF entities, the term \u2018reporting entity\u2019 is defined in AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF paragraphs or footnotes.\n\nScope\n\nAn entity shall apply this Standard in accounting for all share-based payment transactions, whether or not the entity can identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received, including:\n\n1. (a) equity-settled share-based payment transactions,\n2. (b) cash-settled share-based payment transactions, and\n3. (c) transactions in which the entity receives or acquires goods or services and the terms of the arrangement provide either the entity or the supplier of those goods or services with a choice of whether the entity settles the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by issuing equity instruments,\n\nexcept as noted in paragraphs 3A\u20136. In the absence of specifically identifiable goods or services, other circumstances may indicate that goods or services have been (or will be) received, in which case this Standard applies.\n\n3 [Deleted]\n\n3A\n\nA share-based payment transaction may be settled by another group entity (or a shareholder of any group entity) on behalf of the entity receiving or acquiring the goods or services. Paragraph 2 also applies to an entity that\n\n- (a) receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group entity) has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction, or\n- (b) has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same group receives the goods or services\n\nunless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity receiving them.\n\nAASB 2-compiled\n\nAuthorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",

        "text": "# ##\n\nFor the purposes of this Standard, a transaction with an employee (or other party) in his/her capacity as a holder of equity instruments of the entity is not a share-based payment transaction. For example, if an entity grants all holders of a particular class of its equity instruments the right to acquire additional equity instruments of the entity at a price that is less than the fair value of those equity instruments, and an employee receives such a right because he/she is a holder of equity instruments of that particular class, the granting or exercise of that right is not subject to the requirements of this Standard.\n\n# ##\n\nAs noted in paragraph 2, this Standard applies to share-based payment transactions in which an entity acquires or receives goods or services. Goods includes inventories, consumables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets. However, an entity shall not apply this Standard to transactions in which the entity acquires goods as part of the net assets acquired in a business combination as defined by AASB 3 Business Combinations, in a combination of entities or businesses under common control as described in paragraphs B1\u2013B4 of AASB 3, or the contribution of a business on the formation of a joint venture as defined by AASB 11 Joint Arrangements. Hence, equity instruments issued in a business combination in exchange for control of the acquiree are not within the scope of this Standard. However, equity instruments granted to employees of the acquiree in their capacity as employees (eg in return for continued service) are within the scope of this Standard. Similarly, the cancellation, replacement or other modification of share-based payment arrangements because of a business combination or other equity restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this Standard. AASB 3 provides guidance on determining whether equity instruments issued in a business combination are part of the consideration transferred in exchange for control of the acquiree (and therefore within the scope of AASB 3) or are in return for continued service to be recognised in the post-combination period (and therefore within the scope of this Standard).\n\n# ##\n\nThis Standard does not apply to share-based payment transactions in which the entity receives or acquires goods or services under a contract within the scope of paragraphs 8\u201310 of AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation1 or paragraphs 2.4\u20132.7 of AASB 9 Financial Instruments.\n\n# ##\n\nThis Standard uses the term \u2018fair value\u2019 in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of fair value in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. Therefore, when applying AASB 2 an entity measures fair value in accordance with this Standard, not AASB 13.\n\n# ##\n\nAn entity shall recognise the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction when it obtains the goods or as the services are received. The entity shall recognise a corresponding increase in equity if the goods or services were received in an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, or a liability if the goods or services were acquired in a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.\n\n# ##\n\nWhen the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction do not qualify for recognition as assets, they shall be recognised as expenses.\n\n# ##\n\nTypically, an expense arises from the consumption of goods or services. For example, services are typically consumed immediately, in which case an expense is recognised as the counterparty renders service. Goods might be consumed over a period of time or, in the case of inventories, sold at a later date, in which case an expense is recognised when the goods are consumed or sold. However, sometimes it is necessary to recognise an expense before the goods or services are consumed or sold, because they do not qualify for recognition as assets. For example, an entity might acquire goods as part of the research phase of a project to develop a new product. Although those goods have not been consumed, they might not qualify for recognition as assets under the applicable Standard.\n\n# ##\n\nEquity-settled share-based payment transactions\n\nOverview\n\nFor equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, directly, at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the",

The fair value of those equity instruments shall be measured at grant date.\n\n# ##\n\nTypically, shares, share options or other equity instruments are granted to employees as part of their remuneration package, in addition to a cash salary and other employment benefits. Usually, it is not possible to measure directly the services received for particular components of the employee\u2019s remuneration package. It might also not be possible to measure the fair value of the total remuneration package independently, without measuring directly the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Furthermore, shares or share options are sometimes granted as part of a bonus arrangement, rather than as a part of basic remuneration, eg as an incentive to the employees to remain in the entity\u2019s employ or to reward them for their efforts in improving the entity\u2019s performance. By granting shares or share options, in addition to other remuneration, the entity is paying additional remuneration to obtain additional benefits. Estimating the fair value of those additional benefits is likely to be difficult. Because of the difficulty of measuring directly the fair value of the services received, the entity shall measure the fair value of the employee services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n# ##\n\nTo apply the requirements of paragraph 10 to transactions with parties other than employees, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the fair value of the goods or services received can be estimated reliably. That fair value shall be measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service. In rare cases, if the entity rebuts this presumption because it cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.\n\n# ##\n\nIn particular, if the identifiable consideration received (if any) by the entity appears to be less than the fair value of the equity instruments granted or liability incurred, typically this situation indicates that other consideration (ie unidentifiable goods or services) has been (or will be) received by the entity. The entity shall measure the identifiable goods or services received in accordance with this Standard. The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received (or to be received) as the difference between the fair value of the share-based payment and the fair value of any identifiable goods or services received (or to be received). The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received at the grant date. However, for cash-settled transactions, the liability shall be remeasured at the end of each reporting period until it is settled in accordance with paragraphs 30\u201333.\n\n# ##\n\nIf the equity instruments granted vest immediately, the counterparty is not required to complete a specified period of service before becoming unconditionally entitled to those equity instruments. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the entity shall presume that services rendered by the counterparty as consideration for the equity instruments have been received. In this case, on grant date the entity shall recognise the services received in full, with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\n# ##\n\nIf the equity instruments granted do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of service, the entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the counterparty as consideration for those equity instruments will be received in the future, during the vesting period. The entity shall account for those services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. For example:\n\n- (a) if an employee is granted share options conditional upon completing three years\u2019 service, then the entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the employee as consideration for the share options will be received in the future, over that three-year vesting period.\n- (b) if an employee is granted share options conditional upon the achievement of a performance condition and remaining in the entity\u2019s employ until that performance condition is satisfied, and the length of the vesting period varies depending on when that performance condition is satisfied,",

The entity shall estimate the length of the expected vesting period at grant date, based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition. If the performance condition is a market condition, the estimate of the length of the expected vesting period shall be consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the options granted, and shall not be subsequently revised. If the performance condition is not a market condition, the entity shall revise its estimate of the length of the vesting period, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the length of the vesting period differs from previous estimates.\n\n# ##\n\nTransactions measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted\n\nDetermining the fair value of equity instruments granted\n\nFor transactions measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, an entity shall measure the fair value of equity instruments granted at the measurement date, based on market prices if available, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which those equity instruments were granted (subject to the requirements of paragraphs 19\u201322).\n\nIf market prices are not available, the entity shall estimate the fair value of the equity instruments granted using a valuation technique to estimate what the price of those equity instruments would have been on the measurement date in an arm\u2019s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. The valuation technique shall be consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies for pricing financial instruments, and shall incorporate all factors and assumptions that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in setting the price (subject to the requirements of paragraphs 19\u201322).\n\nAppendix B contains further guidance on the measurement of the fair value of shares and share options, focusing on the specific terms and conditions that are common features of a grant of shares or share options to employees.\n\n# ##\n\nTreatment of vesting conditions\n\nA grant of equity instruments might be conditional upon satisfying specified vesting conditions. For example, a grant of shares or share options to an employee is typically conditional on the employee remaining in the entity\u2019s employ for a specified period of time. There might be performance conditions that must be satisfied, such as the entity achieving a specified growth in profit or a specified increase in the entity\u2019s share price. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the measurement date. Instead, vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall be taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest. Hence, on a cumulative basis, no amount is recognised for goods or services received if the equity instruments granted do not vest because of failure to satisfy a vesting condition, other than a market condition, for example, the counterparty fails to complete a specified service period, or a performance condition is not satisfied, subject to the requirements of paragraph 21.\n\nTo apply the requirements of paragraph 19, the entity shall recognise an amount for the goods or services received during the vesting period based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest and shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested, subject to the requirements of paragraph 21.\n\nMarket conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or exercisability) is conditioned, shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with market conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received from a counterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (eg services received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.",

        "text": "# Treatment of non-vesting conditions\n\nSimilarly, an entity shall take into account all non-vesting conditions when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received from a counterparty that satisfies all vesting conditions that are not market conditions (eg services received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether those non-vesting conditions are satisfied.\n\n# Treatment of a reload feature\n\nFor options with a reload feature, the reload feature shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of options granted at the measurement date. Instead, a reload option shall be accounted for as a new option grant, if and when a reload option is subsequently granted.\n\n# After vesting date\n\nHaving recognised the goods or services received in accordance with paragraphs 10\u201322, and a corresponding increase in equity, the entity shall make no subsequent adjustment to total equity after vesting date. For example, the entity shall not subsequently reverse the amount recognised for services received from an employee if the vested equity instruments are later forfeited or, in the case of share options, the options are not exercised. However, this requirement does not preclude the entity from recognising a transfer within equity, ie a transfer from one component of equity to another.\n\n# If the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be estimated reliably\n\nThe requirements in paragraphs 16\u201323 apply when the entity is required to measure a share-based payment transaction by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. In rare cases, the entity may be unable to estimate reliably the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the measurement date, in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs 16\u201322. In these rare cases only, the entity shall instead:\n\n1. measure the equity instruments at their intrinsic value, initially at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service and subsequently at the end of each reporting period and at the date of final settlement, with any change in intrinsic value recognised in profit or loss. For a grant of share options, the share-based payment arrangement is finally settled when the options are exercised, are forfeited (eg upon cessation of employment) or lapse (eg at the end of the option\u2019s life).\n2. recognise the goods or services received based on the number of equity instruments that ultimately vest or (where applicable) are ultimately exercised. To apply this requirement to share options, for example, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received during the vesting period, if any, in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 15, except that the requirements in paragraph 15(b) concerning a market condition do not apply. The amount recognised for goods or services received during the vesting period shall be based on the number of share options expected to vest. The entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested. After vesting date, the entity shall reverse the amount recognised for goods or services received if the share options are later forfeited, or lapse at the end of the share option\u2019s life.\n\n# If an entity applies paragraph 24\n\nIt is not necessary to apply paragraphs 26\u201329, because any modifications to the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted will be taken into account when applying the intrinsic value method set out in paragraph 24. However, if an entity settles a grant of equity instruments to which paragraph 24 has been applied:\n\n1. if the settlement occurs during the vesting period, the entity shall account for the settlement as an acceleration of vesting, and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that would otherwise have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.\n2. any payment made on settlement shall be accounted for as the repurchase of equity instruments, ie as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the intrinsic value of the equity instruments, measured at the repurchase date.

        "text": "# Modifications to the terms and conditions on which equity instruments were granted, including cancellations and settlements\n\n26 An entity might modify the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted. For example, it might reduce the exercise price of options granted to employees (ie reprice the options), which increases the fair value of those options. The requirements in paragraphs 27\u201329 to account for the effects of modifications are expressed in the context of share-based payment transactions with employees. However, the requirements shall also be applied to share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees that are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. In the latter case, any references in paragraphs 27\u201329 to grant date shall instead refer to the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.\n\n# The entity shall recognise, as a minimum, the services received measured at the grant date fair value of the equity instruments granted, unless those equity instruments do not vest because of failure to satisfy a vesting condition (other than a market condition) that was specified at grant date. This applies irrespective of any modifications to the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted, or a cancellation or settlement of that grant of equity instruments. In addition, the entity shall recognise the effects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee. Guidance on applying this requirement is given in Appendix B.\n\n28 If a grant of equity instruments is cancelled or settled during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied):\n\n- (a) the entity shall account for the cancellation or settlement as an acceleration of vesting, and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.\n- (b) any payment made to the employee on the cancellation or settlement of the grant shall be accounted for as the repurchase of an equity interest, ie as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense. However, if the share-based payment arrangement included liability components, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of the liability at the date of cancellation or settlement. Any payment made to settle the liability component shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the liability.\n- (c) if new equity instruments are granted to the employee and, on the date when those new equity instruments are granted, the entity identifies the new equity instruments granted as replacement equity instruments for the cancelled equity instruments, the entity shall account for the granting of replacement equity instruments in the same way as a modification of the original grant of equity instruments, in accordance with paragraph 27 and the guidance in Appendix B. The incremental fair value granted is the difference between the fair value of the replacement equity instruments and the net fair value of the cancelled equity instruments, at the date the replacement equity instruments are granted. The net fair value of the cancelled equity instruments is their fair value, immediately before the cancellation, less the amount of any payment made to the employee on cancellation of the equity instruments that is accounted for as a deduction from equity in accordance with (b) above. If the entity does not identify new equity instruments granted as replacement equity instruments for the cancelled equity instruments, the entity shall account for those new equity instruments as a new grant of equity instruments.\n\n# If an entity or counterparty can choose whether to meet a non-vesting condition, the entity shall treat the entity\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s failure to meet that non-vesting condition during the vesting period as a cancellation.\n\n29 If an entity repurchases vested equity instruments, the payment made to the employee shall be accounted for as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date.

Alternatively, an entity might grant to its employees a right to receive a future cash payment by\ngranting to them a right to shares (including shares to be issued upon the exercise of share options) that are\nredeemable, either mandatorily (for example, upon cessation of employment) or at the employee\u2019s option.\nThese arrangements are examples of cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Share appreciation\nrights are used to illustrate some of the requirements in paragraphs 32\u201333D, however, the requirements in\nthose paragraphs apply to all cash-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\n# ##\n\nThe entity shall recognise the services received, and a liability to pay for those services, as the employees\nrender service. For example, some share appreciation rights vest immediately, and the employees are\ntherefore not required to complete a specified period of service to become entitled to the cash payment. In\nthe absence of evidence to the contrary, the entity shall presume that the services rendered by the employees\nin exchange for the share appreciation rights have been received. Thus, the entity shall recognise\nimmediately the services received and a liability to pay for them. If the share appreciation rights do not vest\nuntil the employees have completed a specified period of service, the entity shall recognise the services\nreceived, and a liability to pay for them, as the employees render service during that period.\n\n# ##\n\nThe liability shall be measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value\nof the share appreciation rights, by applying an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and\nconditions on which the share appreciation rights were granted, and the extent to which the employees have\nrendered service to date\u2014subject to the requirements of paragraphs 33A\u201333D. An entity might modify the\nterms and conditions on which a cash-settled share-based payment is granted. Guidance for a modification\nof a share-based payment transaction that changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled is\ngiven in paragraphs B44A\u2013B44C in Appendix B.\n\n# ##\n\nTreatment of vesting and non-vesting conditions\n\n33A A cash-settled share-based payment transaction might be conditional upon satisfying specified vesting\nconditions. There might be performance conditions that must be satisfied, such as the entity achieving a\nspecified growth in profit or a specified increase in the entity\u2019s share price. Vesting conditions, other than\nmarket conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled share-\nbased payment at the measurement date. Instead, vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall be\ntaken into account by adjusting the number of awards included in the measurement of the liability arising\nfrom the transaction.\n\n33B To apply the requirements in paragraph 33A, the entity shall recognise an amount for the goods or services\nreceived during the vesting period. That amount shall be based on the best available estimate of the number\nof awards that are expected to vest. The entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent\ninformation indicates that the number of awards that are expected to vest differs from previous estimates.\nOn the vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of awards that ultimately vested.\n\n33C Market conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or exercisability) is conditioned, as well\nas non-vesting conditions, shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled\nshare-based payment granted and when remeasuring the fair value at the end of each reporting period and at\nthe date of settlement.\n\n33D As a result of applying paragraphs 30\u201333C, the cumulative amount ultimately recognised for goods or\nservices received as consideration for the cash-settled share-based payment is equal to the cash that is paid.\n\n# ##\n\nShare-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations\n\n33E Tax laws or regulations may oblige an entity to withhold an amount for an employee\u2019s tax obligation\nassociated with a share-based payment and transfer that amount, normally in cash, to the tax authority on\nthe employee\u2019s behalf. To fulfil this obligation, the terms of the share-based payment arrangement may\npermit or require the entity to withhold the number of equity instruments equal to the monetary value of the\nemployee\u2019s tax obligation from the total number of equity instruments that otherwise would have been\nissued to the employee upon exercise (or vesting) of the share-based payment (ie the share-based payment\narrangement has a \u2018net settlement feature\u2019).",

Therefore, the payment made shall be accounted for as a deduction from equity for the shares\nwithheld, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value at the net settlement date of the equity\ninstruments withheld.\n\n33H The exception in paragraph 33F does not apply to:\n(a) a share-based payment arrangement with a net settlement feature for which there is no obligation\non the entity under tax laws or regulations to withhold an amount for an employee\u2019s tax\nobligation associated with that share-based payment; or\n(b) any equity instruments that the entity withholds in excess of the employee\u2019s tax obligation\nassociated with the share-based payment (ie the entity withheld an amount of shares that exceeds\nthe monetary value of the employee\u2019s tax obligation). Such excess shares withheld shall be\naccounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment when this amount is paid in cash (or other\nassets) to the employee.\n\n# ##\n\nShare-based payment transactions with cash alternatives\n\n34 For share-based payment transactions in which the terms of the arrangement provide either the\nentity or the counterparty with the choice of whether the entity settles the transaction in cash (or\nother assets) or by issuing equity instruments, the entity shall account for that transaction, or the\ncomponents of that transaction, as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction if, and to the\nextent that, the entity has incurred a liability to settle in cash or other assets, or as an equity-settled\nshare-based payment transaction if, and to the extent that, no such liability has been incurred.\n\nShare-based payment transactions in which the terms of the\narrangement provide the counterparty with a choice of settlement\n\n35 If an entity has granted the counterparty the right to choose whether a share-based payment transaction is\nsettled in cash or by issuing equity instruments, the entity has granted a compound financial instrument,\nwhich includes a debt component (ie the counterparty\u2019s right to demand payment in cash) and an equity\ncomponent (ie the counterparty\u2019s right to demand settlement in equity instruments rather than in cash). For\ntransactions with parties other than employees, in which the fair value of the goods or services received is\nmeasured directly, the entity shall measure the equity component of the compound financial instrument as\nthe difference between the fair value of the goods or services received and the fair value of the debt\ncomponent, at the date when the goods or services are received.\n\n36 For other transactions, including transactions with employees, the entity shall measure the fair value of the\ncompound financial instrument at the measurement date, taking into account the terms and conditions on\nwhich the rights to cash or equity instruments were granted.\n\n37 To apply paragraph 36, the entity shall first measure the fair value of the debt component, and then measure\nthe fair value of the equity component\u2014taking into account that the counterparty must forfeit the right to\nreceive cash in order to receive the equity instrument. The fair value of the compound financial instrument\nis the sum of the fair values of the two components. However, share-based payment transactions in which\nthe counterparty has the choice of settlement are often structured so that the fair value of one settlement\nalternative is the same as the other. For example, the counterparty might have the choice of receiving share\noptions or cash-settled share appreciation rights. In such cases, the fair value of the equity component is\nzero, and hence the fair value of the compound financial instrument is the same as the fair value of the debt\ncomponent. Conversely, if the fair values of the settlement alternatives differ, the fair value of the equity\ncomponent usually will be greater than zero, in which case the fair value of the compound financial\ninstrument will be greater than the fair value of the debt component.\n\n38 The entity shall account separately for the goods or services received or acquired in respect of each\ncomponent of the compound financial instrument. For the debt component, the entity shall recognise the\ngoods or services acquired, and a liability to pay for those goods or services, as the counterparty supplies",

For example, the term encompasses all management personnel, ie those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, including non-executive directors.\n\n# equity instrument\n\nA contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.\n\n# equity instrument granted\n\nThe right (conditional or unconditional) to an equity instrument of the entity conferred by the entity on another party, under a share-based payment arrangement.\n\n# equity-settled share-based payment transaction\n\nA share-based payment transaction in which the entity\n\n- (a) receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments (including shares or share options), or\n- (b) receives goods or services but has no obligation to settle the transaction with the supplier.\n\n# fair value\n\nThe amount for which an asset could be exchanged, a liability settled, or an equity instrument granted could be exchanged, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm\u2019s length transaction.\n\n# grant date\n\nThe date at which the entity and another party (including an employee) agree to a share-based payment arrangement, being when the entity and the counterparty have a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. At grant date the entity confers on the counterparty the right to cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity, provided the specified vesting conditions, if any, are met. If that agreement is subject to an approval process (for example, by shareholders), grant date is the date when that approval is obtained.\n\n# intrinsic value\n\nThe difference between the fair value of the shares to which the counterparty has the (conditional or unconditional) right to subscribe or which it has the right to receive, and the price (if any) the counterparty is (or will be) required to pay for those shares. For example, a share option with an exercise price of CU15, on a share with a fair value of CU20, has an intrinsic value of CU5.\n\n# market condition\n\nA performance condition upon which the exercise price, vesting or exercisability of an equity instrument depends that is related to the market price (or value) of the entity\u2019s equity instruments (or the equity instruments of another entity in the same group), such as:\n\n- (a) attaining a specified share price or a specified amount of intrinsic value of a share option; or\n\n5 The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in 2019 defines a liability as a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events.\n\nAusCF5 Notwithstanding footnote 5, in respect of AusCF entities, the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements defines a liability as a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits (ie an outflow of cash or other assets of the entity).\n\n6 In this appendix, monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units (CU)\u2019.\n\nAASB 2-compiled\n\nAuthorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",

        "text": "# Appendix B Application guidance\n\nThis appendix is an integral part of the Standard.\n\n# Estimating the fair value of equity instruments granted\n\nParagraphs B2\u2013B41 of this appendix discuss measurement of the fair value of shares and share options granted, focusing on the specific terms and conditions that are common features of a grant of shares or share options to employees. Therefore, it is not exhaustive. Furthermore, because the valuation issues discussed below focus on shares and share options granted to employees, it is assumed that the fair value of the shares or share options is measured at grant date. However, many of the valuation issues discussed below (e.g., determining expected volatility) also apply in the context of estimating the fair value of shares or share options granted to parties other than employees at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.\n\n# Shares\n\nFor shares granted to employees, the fair value of the shares shall be measured at the market price of the entity\u2019s shares (or an estimated market price, if the entity\u2019s shares are not publicly traded), adjusted to take into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted (except for vesting conditions that are excluded from the measurement of fair value in accordance with paragraphs 19\u201321).\n\nFor example, if the employee is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, this factor shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted. Similarly, if the shares are subject to restrictions on transfer after the vesting date, that factor shall be taken into account, but only to the extent that the post-vesting restrictions affect the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for that share. For example, if the shares are actively traded in a deep and liquid market, post-vesting transfer restrictions may have little, if any, effect on the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for those shares. Restrictions on transfer or other restrictions that exist during the vesting period shall not be taken into account when estimating the grant date fair value of the shares granted because those restrictions stem from the existence of vesting conditions, which are accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 19\u201321.\n\n# Share options\n\nFor share options granted to employees, in many cases market prices are not available because the options granted are subject to terms and conditions that do not apply to traded options. If traded options with similar terms and conditions do not exist, the fair value of the options granted shall be estimated by applying an option pricing model.\n\nThe entity shall consider factors that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in selecting the option pricing model to apply. For example, many employee options have long lives, are usually exercisable during the period between the vesting date and the end of the options\u2019 life, and are often exercised early. These factors should be considered when estimating the grant date fair value of the options. For many entities, this might preclude the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, which does not allow for the possibility of exercise before the end of the option\u2019s life and may not adequately reflect the effects of expected early exercise. It also does not allow for the possibility that expected volatility and other model inputs might vary over the option\u2019s life. However, for share options with relatively short contractual lives or that must be exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date, the factors identified above may not apply. In these instances, the Black-Scholes-Merton formula may produce a value that is substantially the same as a more flexible option pricing model.\n\nAll option pricing models take into account, as a minimum, the following factors:\n\n- the exercise price of the option;\n- the life of the option;\n- the current price of the underlying shares;\n- the expected volatility of the share price;",

        "text": "# Inputs to option pricing models\n\nIn estimating the expected volatility of and dividends on the underlying shares, the objective is to approximate the expectations that would be reflected in a current market or negotiated exchange price for the option. Similarly, when estimating the effects of early exercise of employee share options, the objective is to approximate the expectations that an outside party with access to detailed information about employees\u2019 exercise behaviour would develop based on information available at the grant date.\n\nOften, there is likely to be a range of reasonable expectations about future volatility, dividends and exercise behaviour. If so, an expected value should be calculated, by weighting each amount within the range by its associated probability of occurrence.\n\nExpectations about the future are generally based on experience, modified if the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past. In some circumstances, identifiable factors may indicate that unadjusted historical experience is a relatively poor predictor of future experience. For example, if an entity with two distinctly different lines of business disposes of the one that was significantly less risky than the other, historical volatility may not be the best information on which to base reasonable expectations for the future.\n\nIn other circumstances, historical information may not be available. For example, a newly listed entity will have little, if any, historical data on the volatility of its share price. Unlisted and newly listed entities are discussed further below.\n\nIn summary, an entity should not simply base estimates of volatility, exercise behaviour and dividends on historical information without considering the extent to which the past experience is expected to be reasonably predictive of future experience.\n\n# Expected early exercise\n\nEmployees often exercise share options early, for a variety of reasons. For example, employee share options are typically non-transferable. This often causes employees to exercise their share options early, because that is the only way for the employees to liquidate their position. Also, employees who cease employment are usually required to exercise any vested options within a short period of time, otherwise the share options are forfeited. This factor also causes the early exercise of employee share options. Other factors causing early exercise are risk aversion and lack of wealth diversification.\n\nThe means by which the effects of expected early exercise are taken into account depends upon the type of option pricing model applied. For example, expected early exercise could be taken into account by using an estimate of the option\u2019s expected life (which, for an employee share option, is the period of time from grant date to the date on which the option is expected to be exercised) as an input into an option pricing model (eg the Black-Scholes-Merton formula). Alternatively, expected early exercise could be modelled in a binomial or similar option pricing model that uses contractual life as an input.",

        "text": "# Factors to consider in estimating early exercise include:\n\n- (a) the length of the vesting period, because the share option typically cannot be exercised until the end of the vesting period. Hence, determining the valuation implications of expected early exercise is based on the assumption that the options will vest. The implications of vesting conditions are discussed in paragraphs 19\u201321.\n- (b) the average length of time similar options have remained outstanding in the past.\n- (c) the price of the underlying shares. Experience may indicate that the employees tend to exercise options when the share price reaches a specified level above the exercise price.\n- (d) the employee\u2019s level within the organisation. For example, experience might indicate that higher-level employees tend to exercise options later than lower-level employees (discussed further in paragraph B21).\n- (e) expected volatility of the underlying shares. On average, employees might tend to exercise options on highly volatile shares earlier than on shares with low volatility.\n\n# As noted in paragraph B17, the effects of early exercise could be taken into account by using an estimate of the option\u2019s expected life as an input into an option pricing model.\n\nWhen estimating the expected life of share options granted to a group of employees, the entity could base that estimate on an appropriately weighted average expected life for the entire employee group or on appropriately weighted average lives for subgroups of employees within the group, based on more detailed data about employees\u2019 exercise behaviour (discussed further below).\n\n# Separating an option grant into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour is likely to be important.\n\nOption value is not a linear function of option term; value increases at a decreasing rate as the term lengthens. For example, if all other assumptions are equal, although a two-year option is worth more than a one-year option, it is not worth twice as much. That means that calculating estimated option value on the basis of a single weighted average life that includes widely differing individual lives would overstate the total fair value of the share options granted. Separating options granted into several groups, each of which has a relatively narrow range of lives included in its weighted average life, reduces that overstatement.\n\n# Similar considerations apply when using a binomial or similar model.\n\nFor example, the experience of an entity that grants options broadly to all levels of employees might indicate that top-level executives tend to hold their options longer than middle-management employees hold theirs and that lower-level employees tend to exercise their options earlier than any other group. In addition, employees who are encouraged or required to hold a minimum amount of their employer\u2019s equity instruments, including options, might on average exercise options later than employees not subject to that provision. In those situations, separating options by groups of recipients with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour will result in a more accurate estimate of the total fair value of the share options granted.\n\n# Expected volatility\n\nExpected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The measure of volatility used in option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time. Volatility is typically expressed in annualised terms that are comparable regardless of the time period used in the calculation, for example, daily, weekly or monthly price observations.\n\n# The rate of return (which may be positive or negative) on a share for a period measures how much a shareholder has benefited from dividends and appreciation (or depreciation) of the share price.\n\n# The expected annualised volatility of a share is the range within which the continuously compounded annual rate of return is expected to fall approximately two-thirds of the time.\n\nFor example, to say that a share with an expected continuously compounded rate of return of 12 per cent has a volatility of 30 per cent means that the probability that the rate of return on the share for one year will be between \u201318 per cent (12% \u2013 30%) and 42 per cent (12% + 30%) is approximately two-thirds. If the share price is CU100 at the beginning of the year and no dividends are paid, the year-end share price would be expected to be between CU83.53 (CU100 \u00d7 e\u20130.18) and CU152.20 (CU100 \u00d7 e0.42) approximately two-thirds of the time.\n\n# Factors to consider in estimating expected volatility include:\n\n- (a) implied volatility from traded share options on the entity\u2019s shares, or other traded instruments of the entity that include option features (such as convertible debt), if any.",

A newly listed entity might have a high historical volatility, compared with similar entities that have been listed longer. Further guidance for newly listed entities is given below.\n\n(d) the tendency of volatility to revert to its mean, ie its long-term average level, and other factors indicating that expected future volatility might differ from past volatility. For example, if an entity\u2019s share price was extraordinarily volatile for some identifiable period of time because of a failed takeover bid or a major restructuring, that period could be disregarded in computing historical average annual volatility.\n\n(e) appropriate and regular intervals for price observations. The price observations should be consistent from period to period. For example, an entity might use the closing price for each week or the highest price for the week, but it should not use the closing price for some weeks and the highest price for other weeks. Also, the price observations should be expressed in the same currency as the exercise price.\n\n# ## Newly listed entities\n\nAs noted in paragraph B25, an entity should consider historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected option term. If a newly listed entity does not have sufficient information on historical volatility, it should nevertheless compute historical volatility for the longest period for which trading activity is available. It could also consider the historical volatility of similar entities following a comparable period in their lives. For example, an entity that has been listed for only one year and grants options with an average expected life of five years might consider the pattern and level of historical volatility of entities in the same industry for the first six years in which the shares of those entities were publicly traded.\n\n# ## Unlisted entities\n\nAn unlisted entity will not have historical information to consider when estimating expected volatility.\n\nSome factors to consider instead are set out below.\n\nIn some cases, an unlisted entity that regularly issues options or shares to employees (or other parties) might have set up an internal market for its shares. The volatility of those share prices could be considered when estimating expected volatility.\n\nAlternatively, the entity could consider the historical or implied volatility of similar listed entities, for which share price or option price information is available, to use when estimating expected volatility. This would be appropriate if the entity has based the value of its shares on the share prices of similar listed entities.\n\nIf the entity has not based its estimate of the value of its shares on the share prices of similar listed entities, and has instead used another valuation methodology to value its shares, the entity could derive an estimate of expected volatility consistent with that valuation methodology. For example, the entity might value its shares on a net asset or earnings basis. It could consider the expected volatility of those net asset values or earnings.\n\n# ## Expected dividends\n\nWhether expected dividends should be taken into account when measuring the fair value of shares or options granted depends on whether the counterparty is entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents.\n\nFor example, if employees were granted options and are entitled to dividends on the underlying shares or dividend equivalents (which might be paid in cash or applied to reduce the exercise price) between grant date and exercise date, the options granted should be valued as if no dividends will be paid on the underlying shares, ie the input for expected dividends should be zero.\n\nSimilarly, when the grant date fair value of shares granted to employees is estimated, no adjustment is required for expected dividends if the employee is entitled to receive dividends paid during the vesting period.\n\nConversely, if the employees are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period (or before exercise, in the case of an option), the grant date valuation of the rights to shares or options should take expected dividends into account. That is to say, when the fair value of an option grant is",

        "text": "# ##Risk-free interest rate\n\nTypically, the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon government issues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed, with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option being valued (based on the option\u2019s remaining contractual life and taking into account the effects of expected early exercise). It may be necessary to use an appropriate substitute, if no such government issues exist or circumstances indicate that the implied yield on zero-coupon government issues is not representative of the risk-free interest rate (for example, in high inflation economies). Also, an appropriate substitute should be used if market participants would typically determine the risk-free interest rate by using that substitute, rather than the implied yield of zero-coupon government issues, when estimating the fair value of an option with a life equal to the expected term of the option being valued.\n\n# ##Capital structure effects\n\nTypically, third parties, not the entity, write traded share options. When these share options are exercised, the writer delivers shares to the option holder. Those shares are acquired from existing shareholders. Hence the exercise of traded share options has no dilutive effect.\n\nIn contrast, if share options are written by the entity, new shares are issued when those share options are exercised (either actually issued or issued in substance, if shares previously repurchased and held in treasury are used). Given that the shares will be issued at the exercise price rather than the current market price at the date of exercise, this actual or potential dilution might reduce the share price, so that the option holder does not make as large a gain on exercise as on exercising an otherwise similar traded option that does not dilute the share price.\n\nWhether this has a significant effect on the value of the share options granted depends on various factors, such as the number of new shares that will be issued on exercise of the options compared with the number of shares already issued. Also, if the market already expects that the option grant will take place, the market may have already factored the potential dilution into the share price at the date of grant.\n\nHowever, the entity should consider whether the possible dilutive effect of the future exercise of the share options granted might have an impact on their estimated fair value at grant date. Option pricing models can be adapted to take into account this potential dilutive effect.\n\n# ##Modifications to equity-settled share-based payment arrangements\n\nParagraph 27 requires that, irrespective of any modifications to the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted, or a cancellation or settlement of that grant of equity instruments, the entity should recognise, as a minimum, the services received measured at the grant date fair value of the equity instruments granted, unless those equity instruments do not vest because of failure to satisfy a vesting condition (other than a market condition) that was specified at grant date. In addition, the entity should recognise the effects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee.\n\nTo apply the requirements of paragraph 27:\n\n(a) if the modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted (eg by reducing the exercise price), measured immediately before and after the modification, the entity shall include",

Paragraphs B46\u2013B61 discuss how to apply the requirements in paragraphs 43A\u201343C. As noted in paragraph 43D, share-based payment transactions among group entities may take place for a variety of reasons depending on facts and circumstances. Therefore, this discussion is not exhaustive and assumes that when the entity receiving the goods or services has no obligation to settle the transaction, the transaction is a parent\u2019s equity contribution to the subsidiary, regardless of any intragroup repayment arrangements.\n\n# ##\n\nAlthough the discussion below focuses on transactions with employees, it also applies to similar share-based payment transactions with suppliers of goods or services other than employees. An arrangement between a parent and its subsidiary may require the subsidiary to pay the parent for the provision of the equity instruments to the employees. The discussion below does not address how to account for such an intragroup payment arrangement.\n\n# ##\n\nFour issues are commonly encountered in share-based payment transactions among group entities. For convenience, the examples below discuss the issues in terms of a parent and its subsidiary.\n\n# ##\n\nShare-based payment arrangements involving an entity\u2019s own equity instruments\n\n# ##\n\nThe first issue is whether the following transactions involving an entity\u2019s own equity instruments should be accounted for as equity-settled or as cash-settled in accordance with the requirements of this Standard:\n\n(a) an entity grants to its employees rights to equity instruments of the entity (eg share options), and either chooses or is required to buy equity instruments (ie treasury shares) from another party, to satisfy its obligations to its employees; and\n\n(b) an entity\u2019s employees are granted rights to equity instruments of the entity (eg share options), either by the entity itself or by its shareholders, and the shareholders of the entity provide the equity instruments needed.\n\n# ##\n\nThe entity shall account for share-based payment transactions in which it receives services as consideration for its own equity instruments as equity-settled. This applies regardless of whether the entity chooses or is required to buy those equity instruments from another party to satisfy its obligations to its employees under the share-based payment arrangement. It also applies regardless of whether:\n\n(a) the employee\u2019s rights to the entity\u2019s equity instruments were granted by the entity itself or by its shareholder(s); or\n\n(b) the share-based payment arrangement was settled by the entity itself or by its shareholder(s).\n\n# ##\n\nIf the shareholder has an obligation to settle the transaction with its investee\u2019s employees, it provides equity instruments of its investee rather than its own. Therefore, if its investee is in the same group as the shareholder, in accordance with paragraph 43C, the shareholder shall measure its obligation in accordance with the requirements applicable to cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the shareholder\u2019s separate financial statements and those applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the shareholder\u2019s consolidated financial statements.",

For example, employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to equity instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to the subsidiary.\n\nB52 Therefore, the second issue concerns the following share-based payment arrangements:\n\n- (a) a parent grants rights to its equity instruments directly to the employees of its subsidiary: the parent (not the subsidiary) has the obligation to provide the employees of the subsidiary with the equity instruments; and\n- (b) a subsidiary grants rights to equity instruments of its parent to its employees: the subsidiary has the obligation to provide its employees with the equity instruments.\n\n# A parent grants rights to its equity instruments to the employees of its subsidiary (paragraph B52(a))\n\nB53 The subsidiary does not have an obligation to provide its parent\u2019s equity instruments to the subsidiary\u2019s employees. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 43B, the subsidiary shall measure the services received from its employees in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, and recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from the parent.\n\nB54 The parent has an obligation to settle the transaction with the subsidiary\u2019s employees by providing the parent\u2019s own equity instruments. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 43C, the parent shall measure its obligation in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\n# A subsidiary grants rights to equity instruments of its parent to its employees (paragraph B52(b))\n\nB55 Because the subsidiary does not meet either of the conditions in paragraph 43B, it shall account for the transaction with its employees as cash-settled. This requirement applies irrespective of how the subsidiary obtains the equity instruments to satisfy its obligations to its employees.\n\n# Share-based payment arrangements involving cash-settled payments to employees\n\nB56 The third issue is how an entity that receives goods or services from its suppliers (including employees) should account for share-based arrangements that are cash-settled when the entity itself does not have any obligation to make the required payments to its suppliers. For example, consider the following arrangements in which the parent (not the entity itself) has an obligation to make the required cash payments to the employees of the entity:\n\n- (a) the employees of the entity will receive cash payments that are linked to the price of its equity instruments.\n- (b) the employees of the entity will receive cash payments that are linked to the price of its parent\u2019s equity instruments.\n\nB57 The subsidiary does not have an obligation to settle the transaction with its employees. Therefore, the subsidiary shall account for the transaction with its employees as equity-settled, and recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from its parent. The subsidiary shall remeasure the cost of the transaction subsequently for any changes resulting from non-market vesting conditions not being met in accordance with paragraphs 19\u201321. This differs from the measurement of the transaction as cash-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the group.\n\nB58 Because the parent has an obligation to settle the transaction with the employees, and the consideration is cash, the parent (and the consolidated group) shall measure its obligation in accordance with the requirements applicable to cash-settled share-based payment transactions in paragraph 43C.\n\n# Transfer of employees between group entities\n\nB59 The fourth issue relates to group share-based payment arrangements that involve employees of more than one group entity.

An employee of one subsidiary might transfer employment to another subsidiary during the specified vesting period without the employee\u2019s rights to equity instruments of the parent under the original share-based payment arrangement being affected. If the subsidiaries have no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction with their employees, they account for it as an equity-settled transaction.

        "text": "# Guidance on implementing AASB 2 Share-based Payment\n\nThis guidance accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 2.\n\n# Definition of grant date\n\nIG1 AASB 2 defines grant date as the date at which the entity and the employee (or other party providing similar services) agree to a share-based payment arrangement, being when the entity and the counterparty have a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. At grant date the entity confers on the counterparty the right to cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity, provided the specified vesting conditions, if any, are met. If that agreement is subject to an approval process (for example, by shareholders), grant date is the date when that approval is obtained.\n\nIG2 As noted above, grant date is when both parties agree to a share-based payment arrangement. The word \u2018agree\u2019 is used in its usual sense, which means that there must be both an offer and acceptance of that offer. Hence, the date at which one party makes an offer to another party is not grant date. The date of grant is when that other party accepts the offer. In some instances, the counterparty explicitly agrees to the arrangement, eg by signing a contract. In other instances, agreement might be implicit, eg for many share-based payment arrangements with employees, the employees\u2019 agreement is evidenced by their commencing to render services.\n\nIG3 Furthermore, for both parties to have agreed to the share-based payment arrangement, both parties must have a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Therefore, if some of the terms and conditions of the arrangement are agreed on one date, with the remainder of the terms and conditions agreed on a later date, then grant date is on that later date, when all of the terms and conditions have been agreed. For example, if an entity agrees to issue share options to an employee, but the exercise price of the options will be set by a compensation committee that meets in three months\u2019 time, grant date is when the exercise price is set by the compensation committee.\n\nIG4 In some cases, grant date might occur after the employees to whom the equity instruments were granted have begun rendering services. For example, if a grant of equity instruments is subject to shareholder approval, grant date might occur some months after the employees have begun rendering services in respect of that grant. The Standard requires the entity to recognise the services when received. In this situation, the entity should estimate the grant date fair value of the equity instruments (eg by estimating the fair value of the equity instruments at the end of the reporting period), for the purposes of recognising the services received during the period between service commencement date and grant date. Once the date of grant has been established, the entity should revise the earlier estimate so that the amounts recognised for services received in respect of the grant are ultimately based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments.\n\n# Definition of vesting conditions\n\nIG4A AASB 2 defines vesting conditions as the conditions that determine whether the entity receives the services that entitle the counterparty to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity under a share-based payment arrangement. The following flowchart illustrates the evaluation of whether a condition is a service or performance condition or a non-vesting condition.\n\nAASB 2-compiled 33 IMPLEMENTATION Authorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",

In these situations, paragraph 13 of AASB 2 requires the entity to measure that fair value at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.\n\nTransaction in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received\n\nIn some cases, however, it might be difficult to demonstrate that goods or services have been (or will be) received. For example, an entity may grant shares to a charitable organisation for nil consideration. It is usually not possible to identify the specific goods or services received in return for such a transaction. A similar situation might arise in transactions with other parties.\n\nParagraph 11 of AASB 2 requires transactions in which share-based payments are made to employees to be measured by reference to the fair value of the share-based payments at grant date. Hence, the entity is not required to measure directly the fair value of the employee services received.\n\nIt should be noted that the phrase \u2018the fair value of the share-based payment\u2019 refers to the fair value of the particular share-based payment concerned. For example, an entity might be required by government legislation to issue some portion of its shares to nationals of a particular country that may be transferred only to other nationals of that country. Such a transfer restriction may affect the fair value of the shares concerned, and therefore those shares may have a fair value that is less than the fair value of otherwise identical shares that do not carry such restrictions. In this situation, the phrase \u2018the fair value of the share-based payment\u2019 would refer to the fair value of the restricted shares, not the fair value of other, unrestricted shares.\n\nParagraph 13A of AASB 2 specifies how such transactions should be measured. The following example illustrates how the entity should apply the requirements of the Standard to a transaction in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received.\n\nIn AASB 2, all references to employees include others providing similar services.",

The economic benefits derived from enhancing its corporate image could take a variety of forms, such as increasing its customer base, attracting or retaining employees, or improving or maintaining its ability to tender successfully for business contracts. The entity cannot identify the specific consideration received. For example, no cash was received and no service conditions were imposed. Therefore, the identifiable consideration (nil) is less than the fair value of the equity instruments granted (CU100,000).\n\n# Application of requirements\n\nAlthough the entity cannot identify the specific goods or services received, the circumstances indicate that goods or services have been (or will be) received, and therefore AASB 2 applies. In this situation, because the entity cannot identify the specific goods or services received, the rebuttable presumption in paragraph 13 of AASB 2, that the fair value of the goods or services received can be estimated reliably, does not apply. The entity should instead measure the goods or services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n(a) In this example, and in all other examples in this guidance, monetary amounts are denominated in \u2018currency units (CU)\u2019.\n\n# Measurement date for transactions with parties other than employees\n\nIG6 If the goods or services are received on more than one date, the entity should measure the fair value of the equity instruments granted on each date when goods or services are received. The entity should apply that fair value when measuring the goods or services received on that date.\n\nIG7 However, an approximation could be used in some cases. For example, if an entity received services continuously during a three-month period, and its share price did not change significantly during that period, the entity could use the average share price during the three-month period when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n# Transitional arrangements\n\nIG8 In paragraph 54 of AASB 2, the entity is encouraged, but not required, to apply the requirements of the Standard to other grants of equity instruments (ie grants other than those specified in paragraph 53 of the Standard), if the entity has disclosed publicly the fair value of those equity instruments, measured at the measurement date. For example, such equity instruments include equity instruments for which the entity has disclosed in the notes to its financial statements the information required in the US by SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock-based Compensation.\n\n# Equity-settled share-based payment transactions\n\nIG9 For equity-settled transactions measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, paragraph 19 of AASB 2 states that vesting conditions, other than market conditions,9 are not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the measurement date (ie grant date, for transactions with employees and others providing similar services). Instead, vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest. Hence, on a\n\n9 In the remainder of this paragraph, the discussion of vesting conditions excludes market conditions, which are subject to the requirements of paragraph 21 of AASB 2.",

On vesting date, the entity revises the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested (subject to the requirements of paragraph 21 concerning market conditions).\n\n# IG11\n\nIn the examples below, the share options granted all vest at the same time, at the end of a specified period. In some situations, share options or other equity instruments granted might vest in instalments over the vesting period. For example, suppose an employee is granted 100 share options, which will vest in instalments of 25 share options at the end of each year over the next four years. To apply the requirements of the Standard, the entity should treat each instalment as a separate share option grant, because each instalment has a different vesting period, and hence the fair value of each instalment will differ (because the length of the vesting period affects, for example, the likely timing of cash flows arising from the exercise of the options).\n\n# IG Example 1A\n\nBackground\n\nAn entity grants 100 share options to each of its 500 employees. Each grant is conditional upon the employee working for the entity over the next three years.

The entity revises its estimate of total employee departures over the three-year period from 15 per cent to 12 per cent (60 employees). During year 3, a further 15 employees leave.

The entity expects that a further 25 employees will leave during year 3, and that the entity\u2019s earnings will increase by at least 6 per cent, thereby achieving the average of 10 per cent per year.\n\nBy the end of year 3, 23 employees have left and the entity\u2019s earnings had increased by 8 per cent, resulting in an average increase of 10.67 per cent per year.

The share options will vest at the end of year 3, provided that the employees remain in the entity\u2019s employ, and provided that the volume of sales of a particular product increases by at least an average of 5 per cent per year. If the volume of sales of the product increases by an average of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent per year, each employee will receive 100 share options. If the volume of sales increases by an average of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent each year, each employee will receive 200 share options. If the volume of sales increases by an average of 15 per cent or more, each employee will receive 300 share options. On grant date, Entity A estimates that the share options have a fair value of CU20 per option. Entity A also estimates that the volume of sales of the product will increase by an average of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent per year, and therefore expects that, for each employee who remains in service until the end of year 3, 200 share options will vest. The entity also estimates, on the basis of a weighted average probability, that 20 per cent of employees will leave before the end of year 3. By the end of year 1, seven employees have left and the entity still expects that a total of 20 employees will leave by the end of year 3. Hence, the entity expects that 80 employees will remain in service for the three-year period. Product sales have increased by 12 per cent and the entity expects this rate of increase to continue over the next 2 years. By the end of year 2, a further five employees have left, bringing the total to 12 to date. The entity now expects only three more employees will leave during year 3, and therefore expects a total of 15 employees will have left during the three-year period, and hence 85 employees are expected to remain. Product sales have increased by 18 per cent, resulting in an average of 15 per cent over the two years to date. The entity now expects that sales will average 15 per cent or more over the three-year period, and hence expects each sales employee to receive 300 share options at the end of year 3. By the end of year 3, a further two employees have left. Hence, 14 employees have left during the three-year period, and 86 employees remain. The entity\u2019s sales have increased by an average of 16 per cent over the three years. Therefore, each of the 86 employees receives 300 share options.\n\nApplication of requirements\n\n|Year|Calculation|Remuneration expense for period|Cumulative remuneration expense|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|80 employees \u00d7 200 options \u00d7 CU20 \u00d7 1/3|106,667|106,667|\n|2|(85 employees \u00d7 300 options \u00d7 CU20 \u00d7 2/3 ) \u2013 CU106,667|233,333|340,000|\n|3|(86 employees \u00d7 300 options \u00d7 CU20 \u00d7 3/3) \u2013 CU340,000|176,000|516,000|\n\n# AASB 2-compiled\n\n38 IMPLEMENTATION Authorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",

The exercise price is CU40. However, the exercise price drops to CU30 if the entity\u2019s earnings increase by at least an average of 10 per cent per year over the three-year period.\n\nOn grant date, the entity estimates that the fair value of the share options, with an exercise price of CU30, is CU16 per option. If the exercise price is CU40, the entity estimates that the share options have a fair value of CU12 per option.\n\nDuring year 1, the entity\u2019s earnings increased by 12 per cent, and the entity expects that earnings will continue to increase at this rate over the next two years. The entity therefore expects that the earnings target will be achieved, and hence the share options will have an exercise price of CU30.\n\nDuring year 2, the entity\u2019s earnings increased by 13 per cent, and the entity continues to expect that the earnings target will be achieved.\n\nDuring year 3, the entity\u2019s earnings increased by only 3 per cent, and therefore the earnings target was not achieved. The executive completes three years\u2019 service, and therefore satisfies the service condition. Because the earnings target was not achieved, the 10,000 vested share options have an exercise price of CU40.\n\nApplication of requirements\n\nBecause the exercise price varies depending on the outcome of a performance condition that is not a market condition, the effect of that performance condition (i.e., the possibility that the exercise price might be CU40 and the possibility that the exercise price might be CU30) is not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the share options at grant date. Instead, the entity estimates the fair value of the share options at grant date under each scenario (i.e., exercise price of CU40 and exercise price of CU30) and ultimately revises the transaction amount to reflect the outcome of that performance condition, as illustrated below.\n\n|Year|Calculation|Remuneration expense for period|Cumulative remuneration expense|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|10,000 options \u00d7 CU16 \u00d7 1/3|53,333|53,333|\n|2|(10,000 options \u00d7 CU16 \u00d7 2/3) \u2013 CU53,333|53,334|106,667|\n|3|(10,000 options \u00d7 CU12 \u00d7 3/3) \u2013 CU106,667|13,333|120,000|\n\n# IG13\n\nParagraph 21 of the Standard requires market conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or exercisability) is conditional, to be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with market conditions, the entity recognises the goods or services received from a counterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (e.g., services received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied. Example 5 illustrates these requirements.\n\n# IG Example 5\n\nGrant with a market condition\n\nBackground\n\nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants to a senior executive 10,000 share options, conditional upon the executive remaining in the entity\u2019s employ until the end of year 3.

If the share price is above CU65 at the end of year 3, the share options can be exercised\nat any time during the next seven years, ie by the end of year 10.\nThe entity applies a binomial option pricing model, which takes into account the possibility that the share\nprice will exceed CU65 at the end of year 3 (and hence the share options become exercisable) and the\npossibility that the share price will not exceed CU65 at the end of year 3 (and hence the options will be\nforfeited). It estimates the fair value of the share options with this market condition to be CU24 per\noption.\n\nApplication of requirements\nBecause paragraph 21 of the Standard requires the entity to recognise the services received from a\ncounterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (eg services received from an employee who\nremains in service for the specified service period), irrespective of whether that market condition is\nsatisfied, it makes no difference whether the share price target is achieved. The possibility that the share\nprice target might not be achieved has already been taken into account when estimating the fair value of\nthe share options at grant date. Therefore, if the entity expects the executive to complete the three-year\nservice period, and the executive does so, the entity recognises the following amounts in years 1, 2 and 3:\n\n|Year|Calculation|Remuneration expense for period|Cumulative remuneration expense|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|10,000 options \u00d7 CU24 \u00d7 1/3|80,000|80,000|\n|2|(10,000 options \u00d7 CU24 \u00d7 2/3) \u2013 CU80,000|80,000|160,000|\n|3|(10,000 options \u00d7 CU24) \u2013 CU160,000|80,000|240,000|\n\nAs noted above, these amounts are recognised irrespective of the outcome of the market condition.\nHowever, if the executive left during year 2 (or year 3), the amount recognised during year 1 (and year 2)\nwould be reversed in year 2 (or year 3). This is because the service condition, in contrast to the market\ncondition, was not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the share options at grant date.\nInstead, the service condition is taken into account by adjusting the transaction amount to be based on the\nnumber of equity instruments that ultimately vest, in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 20 of the\nStandard.\n\n# IG14\n\nIn Example 5, the outcome of the market condition did not change the length of the vesting period.\nHowever, if the length of the vesting period varies depending on when a performance condition is satisfied,\nparagraph 15 of the Standard requires the entity to presume that the services to be rendered by the\nemployees as consideration for the equity instruments granted will be received in the future, over the\nexpected vesting period. The entity is required to estimate the length of the expected vesting period at grant\ndate, based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition. If the performance condition is a\nmarket condition, the estimate of the length of the expected vesting period must be consistent with the\nassumptions used in estimating the fair value of the share options granted, and is not subsequently revised.\nExample 6 illustrates these requirements.\n\n# IG Example 6\n\nGrant with a market condition, in which the length of the vesting period varies\nBackground\nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants 10,000 share options with a ten-year life to each of ten senior\nexecutives.

In other words, of all the possible outcomes, the most likely outcome of the market condition is that the share price target will be achieved at the end of year 5. Therefore, the entity estimates that the expected vesting period is five years. The entity also estimates that two executives will have left by the end of year 5, and therefore expects that 80,000 share options (10,000 share options \u00d7 8 executives) will vest at the end of year 5.\n\nThroughout years 1\u20134, the entity continues to estimate that a total of two executives will leave by the end of year 5.

The entity estimates that a further 70 employees will leave during years 2 and 3, and hence the total expected employee departures over the three-year vesting period is 110 employees. During year 2, a further 35 employees leave, and the entity estimates that a further 30 employees will leave during year 3, to bring the total expected employee departures over the three-year vesting period to 105 employees.

If the modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted (eg by reducing the exercise price), measured immediately before and after the modification, paragraph B43(a) of Appendix B requires the entity to include the incremental fair value granted (ie the difference between the fair value of the modified equity instrument and that of the original equity instrument, both estimated as at the date of the modification) in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted. If the modification occurs during the vesting period, the incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the period from the modification date until the date when the modified equity instruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant date fair value of the original equity instruments, which is recognised over the remainder of the original vesting period.\n\nThe incremental value is CU3 per share option (CU8 \u2013 CU5).

Therefore, the\nentity recognises the services received over the three-year period, based on the grant date fair value of the\nshares.\n\nFurthermore, the addition of the cash alternative at the end of year 2 creates an obligation to settle in\ncash.

The monthly payments are made by deduction from the employee\u2019s salary. The employee may use the accumulated savings to exercise his options at the end of three years, or take a refund of his contributions at any point during the three-year period. The estimated annual expense for the share-based payment arrangement is CU120.\n\nAfter 18 months, the employee stops paying contributions to the plan and takes a refund of contributions paid to date of CU1,800.\n\nApplication of requirements\n\nThere are three components to this plan: paid salary, salary deduction paid to the savings plan, and share-based payment. The entity recognizes an expense in respect of each component and a corresponding increase in liability or equity as appropriate. The requirement to pay contributions to the plan is a non-vesting condition, which the employee chooses not to meet in the second year. Therefore, in accordance with paragraphs 28(b) and 28A of the Standard, the repayment of contributions is treated as an extinguishment of the liability and the cessation of contributions in year 2 is treated as a cancellation.\n\n# YEAR 1\n\n- Paid salary: 3,600 (75% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 12)\n- Salary deduction paid to the savings plan: 1,200 (25% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 12)\n- Share-based payment: 120 (120)\n- Total: 4,920 (3,600) (1,200) (120)\n\n# YEAR 2\n\n- Paid salary: 4,200 (75% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 6 + 100% \u00d7 400 \u00d7 6)\n- Cash: (4,200)",

The following example illustrates these requirements.\n\n# IG Example 10\n\nGrant of share options that is accounted for by applying the intrinsic value method\n\nBackground\n\nAt the beginning of year 1, an entity grants 1,000 share options to 50 employees. The share options will vest at the end of year 3, provided the employees remain in service until then. The share options have a life of 10 years. The exercise price is CU60 and the entity\u2019s share price is also CU60 at the date of grant. At the date of grant, the entity concludes that it cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the share options granted.\n\nAt the end of year 1, three employees have ceased employment and the entity estimates that a further seven employees will leave during years 2 and 3. Hence, the entity estimates that 80 per cent of the share options will vest.\n\nTwo employees leave during year 2, and the entity revises its estimate of the number of share options that it expects will vest to 86 per cent.\n\nTwo employees leave during year 3.

The following example illustrates the application of AASB 2 to one particular type of plan\u2014an employee share purchase plan. Typically, an employee share purchase plan provides employees with the opportunity to purchase the entity\u2019s shares at a discounted price. The terms and conditions under which employee share purchase plans operate differ from country to country. That is to say, not only are there many different types of employee share and share options plans, there are also many different types of employee share purchase plans. Therefore, the following example illustrates the application of AASB 2 to one specific employee share purchase plan.\n\n# IG Example 11\n\nEmployee share purchase plan Background An entity offers all its 1,000 employees the opportunity to participate in an employee share purchase plan. The employees have two weeks to decide whether to accept the offer. Under the terms of the plan, the employees are entitled to purchase a maximum of 100 shares each. The purchase price will be 20 per cent less than the market price of the entity\u2019s shares at the date the offer is accepted, and the purchase price must be paid immediately upon acceptance of the offer. All shares purchased must be held in trust for the employees, and cannot be sold for five years. The employee is not permitted to withdraw from the plan during that period. For example, if the employee ceases employment during the five-year period, the shares must nevertheless remain in the plan until the end of the five-year period. Any dividends paid during the five-year period will be held in trust for the employees until the end of the five-year period.",

        "text": "# IG Example 11\n\nIn total, 800 employees accept the offer and each employee purchases, on average, 80 shares, ie the employees purchase a total of 64,000 shares. The weighted-average market price of the shares at the purchase date is CU30 per share, and the weighted-average purchase price is CU24 per share.\n\nApplication of requirements\n\nFor transactions with employees, AASB 2 requires the transaction amount to be measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted (AASB 2, paragraph 11). To apply this requirement, it is necessary first to determine the type of equity instrument granted to the employees. Although the plan is described as an employee share purchase plan (ESPP), some ESPPs include option features and are therefore, in effect, share option plans. For example, an ESPP might include a \u2018look-back feature\u2019, whereby the employee is able to purchase shares at a discount, and choose whether the discount is applied to the entity\u2019s share price at the date of grant or its share price at the date of purchase. Or an ESPP might specify the purchase price, and then allow the employees a significant period of time to decide whether to participate in the plan. Another example of an option feature is an ESPP that permits the participating employees to cancel their participation before or at the end of a specified period and obtain a refund of amounts previously paid into the plan.\n\nHowever, in this example, the plan includes no option features. The discount is applied to the share price at the purchase date, and the employees are not permitted to withdraw from the plan.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the effect of post-vesting transfer restrictions, if any. Paragraph B3 of AASB 2 states that, if shares are subject to restrictions on transfer after the vesting date, that factor should be taken into account when estimating the fair value of those shares, but only to the extent that the post-vesting restrictions affect the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for that share. For example, if the shares are actively traded in a deep and liquid market, post-vesting transfer restrictions may have little, if any, effect on the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for those shares.\n\nIn this example, the shares are vested when purchased, but cannot be sold for five years after the date of purchase. Therefore, the entity should consider the valuation effect of the five-year post-vesting transfer restriction. This entails using a valuation technique to estimate what the price of the restricted share would have been on the purchase date in an arm\u2019s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. Suppose that, in this example, the entity estimates that the fair value of each restricted share is CU28. In this case, the fair value of the equity instruments granted is CU4 per share (being the fair value of the restricted share of CU28 less the purchase price of CU24). Because 64,000 shares were purchased, the total fair value of the equity instruments granted is CU256,000.\n\nIn this example, there is no vesting period. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 14 of AASB 2, the entity should recognise an expense of CU256,000 immediately.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the expense relating to an ESPP might not be material. AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors states that the accounting policies in Australian Accounting Standards need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial (AASB 108, paragraph 8). AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements states that information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity. Materiality depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its financial statements taken as a whole (AASB 101, paragraph 7). Therefore, in this example, the entity should consider whether the expense of CU256,000 is material.\n\n# Cash-settled share-based payment transactions\n\nParagraphs 30\u201333 of the Standard set out requirements for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by incurring liabilities to the supplier of those goods or services in amounts based on the price of the entity\u2019s shares or other equity instruments. The entity is required to recognise initially the goods or services acquired, and a liability to pay for those goods or services, when the entity obtains the goods or as the services are rendered, measured at the fair value of the liability. Thereafter, until the liability is settled, the entity is required to recognise changes in the fair value of the liability.\n\nAASB 2-compiled 47 IMPLEMENTATION\n\nAuthorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",

If the share appreciation rights do not vest until the employees have completed a specified period of service, the entity recognises the services received, and a liability to pay for them, as the employees render service during that period. The liability is measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the share appreciation rights in accordance with paragraphs 30\u201333D of AASB 2. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Therefore, if the amount recognised for the services received was included in the carrying amount of an asset recognised in the entity\u2019s statement of financial position (for example, inventory), the carrying amount of that asset is not adjusted for the effects of the liability remeasurement. Example 12 illustrates these requirements for a cash-settled share-based payment transaction that is subject to a service condition. Example 12A illustrates these requirements for a cash-settled share-based payment transaction that is subject to a performance condition.\n\n# IG Example 12\n\nBackground\n\nAn entity grants 100 cash share appreciation rights (SARs) to each of its 500 employees, on condition that the employees remain in its employ for the next three years.

During year 2, 40 employees leave and the entity estimates that a further 25 will leave during year 3. During year 3, 22 employees leave. At the end of year 3, 150 employees exercise their SARs, another 140 employees exercise their SARs at the end of year 4 and the remaining 113 employees exercise their SARs at the end of year 5.

The entity transfers that amount, normally in cash, to the tax authority on the employee\u2019s behalf. Example 12B illustrates these requirements.\n\n# IG Example 12B\n\nBackground\n\nThe tax law in jurisdiction X requires entities to withhold an amount for an employee\u2019s tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and transfer that amount in cash to the tax authority on the employee\u2019s behalf. On 1 January 20X1 an entity in jurisdiction X grants an award of 100 shares to an employee; that award is conditional upon the completion of four years\u2019 service. The entity expects that the employee will complete the service period. For simplicity, this example assumes that none of the employee\u2019s compensation qualifies for capitalisation as part of the cost of an asset. The terms and conditions of the share-based payment arrangement require the entity to withhold shares from the settlement of the award to its employee in order to settle the employee\u2019s tax obligation (that is, the share-based payment arrangement has a \u2018net settlement feature\u2019). Accordingly, the entity settles the transaction on a net basis by withholding the number of shares with a fair value equal to the monetary value of the employee\u2019s tax obligation and issuing the remaining shares to the employee on completion of the vesting period. The employee\u2019s tax obligation associated with the award is calculated based on the fair value of the shares on the vesting date. The employee\u2019s applicable tax rate is 40 per cent.",

Accordingly, on the vesting date, the entity issues 60 shares to the employee and withholds 40 shares (CU400 = 40 shares \u00d7 CU10 per share). The entity pays the fair value of the withheld shares in cash to the tax authority on the employee\u2019s behalf.

        "text": "# Share-based payment arrangements with cash alternatives\n\nIG20 Some employee share-based payment arrangements permit the employee to choose whether to receive cash or equity instruments. In this situation, a compound financial instrument has been granted, ie a financial instrument with debt and equity components. Paragraph 37 of the Standard requires the entity to estimate the fair value of the compound financial instrument at grant date, by first measuring the fair value of the debt component, and then measuring the fair value of the equity component\u2014taking into account that the employee must forfeit the right to receive cash to receive the equity instrument.\n\nIG21 Typically, share-based payment arrangements with cash alternatives are structured so that the fair value of one settlement alternative is the same as the other. For example, the employee might have the choice of receiving share options or cash share appreciation rights. In such cases, the fair value of the equity component will be zero, and hence the fair value of the compound financial instrument will be the same as the fair value of the debt component. However, if the fair values of the settlement alternatives differ, usually the fair value of the equity component will be greater than zero, in which case the fair value of the compound financial instrument will be greater than the fair value of the debt component.\n\nIG22 Paragraph 38 of the Standard requires the entity to account separately for the services received in respect of each component of the compound financial instrument. For the debt component, the entity recognises the services received, and a liability to pay for those services, as the counterparty renders service, in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled share-based payment transactions. For the equity component (if any), the entity recognises the services received, and an increase in equity, as the counterparty renders service, in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. Example 13 illustrates these requirements.\n\n# IG Example 13\n\nBackground\n\nAn entity grants to an employee the right to choose either 1,000 phantom shares, ie a right to a cash payment equal to the value of 1,000 shares, or 1,200 shares. The grant is conditional upon the completion of three years\u2019 service. If the employee chooses the share alternative, the shares must be held for three years after vesting date.\n\nAt grant date, the entity\u2019s share price is CU50 per share. At the end of years 1, 2 and 3, the share price is CU52, CU55 and CU60 respectively. The entity does not expect to pay dividends in the next three years. After taking into account the effects of the post-vesting transfer restrictions, the entity estimates that the grant date fair value of the share alternative is CU48 per share.\n\nAt the end of year 3, the employee chooses:\n\nScenario 1: The cash alternative\n\nScenario 2: The equity alternative\n\nApplication of requirements\n\nThe fair value of the equity alternative is CU57,600 (1,200 shares \u00d7 CU48). The fair value of the cash alternative is CU50,000 (1,000 phantom shares \u00d7 CU50). Therefore, the fair value of the equity component of the compound instrument is CU7,600 (CU57,600 \u2013 CU50,000).\n\nThe entity recognises the following amounts:\n\n|Year|Expense|Equity|Liability|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|17,333|2,533|17,333|\n|2|19,333|2,533|19,333|",

The fair value of the share options on grant date is\nCU30 each. At grant date, the subsidiary estimates that 80 per cent of the employees will complete the\ntwo-year service period. This estimate does not change during the vesting period. At the end of the\nvesting period, 81 employees complete the required two years of service. The parent does not require the\nsubsidiary to pay for the shares needed to settle the grant of share options.\nApplication of requirements\nAs required by paragraph B53 of the Standard, over the two-year vesting period, the subsidiary measures\nthe services received from the employees in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-\nsettled share-based payment transactions. Thus, the subsidiary measures the services received from the\nemployees on the basis of the fair value of the share options at grant date. An increase in equity is\nrecognised as a contribution from the parent in the separate or individual financial statements of the\nsubsidiary.\nThe journal entries recorded by the subsidiary for each of the two years are as follows:\nYear 1\nDr Remuneration expense\n(200 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 CU30 \u00d7 0.8/2)                                                              CU240,000\nCr Equity (Contribution from the parent)                                                                              CU240,000\nYear 2\nDr Remuneration expense\n(200 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 CU30 \u00d7 0.81 \u2013 240,000)                                                     CU246,000\nCr Equity (Contribution from the parent)                                                                              CU246,000\n\nAASB 2-compiled                                                           54                                            IMPLEMENTATION\nAuthorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",

Share-based Payment During the period ended 31 December 20X5, the Company had four share-based payment arrangements, which are described below.\n\n# Type of arrangement\n\n| |Senior management share option plan|General employee share option plan|Executive share plan|Senior management share appreciation cash plan|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Date of grant|1 January 20X4|1 January 20X5|1 January 20X5|1 July 20X5|\n|Number granted|50,000|75,000|50,000|25,000|\n|Contractual life|10 years|10 years|N/A|10 years|\n|Vesting conditions|1.5 years\u2019 service and achievement of a share price target, which was achieved.|Three years\u2019 service.|Three years\u2019 service and achievement of a target growth in earnings per share.|Three years\u2019 service and achievement of a target increase in market share.|\n\nThe estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is CU23.60. This was calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model. The model inputs were the share price at grant date of CU50, exercise price of CU50, expected volatility of 30 per cent, no expected dividends, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate of 5 per cent. To allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options after vesting date when the share price was twice the exercise price. Historical volatility was 40 per cent, which includes the early years of the Company\u2019s life; the Company expects the volatility of its share price to reduce as it matures. The estimated fair value of each share granted in the executive share plan is CU50.00, which is equal to the share price at the date of grant.\n\n# Further details of the two share option plans are as follows:\n\n| |20X4|20X5| | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Number of options|Weighted average exercise price|Number of options|Weighted average exercise price| | |\n|Outstanding at start of year| |0|-|45,000| |CU40|\n|Granted| |50,000|CU40|75,000| |CU50|\n|Forfeited| |(5,000)|CU40|(8,000)| |CU46|\n|Exercised| |0|-|(4,000)| |CU40|\n|Outstanding at end of year| |45,000|CU40|108,000| |CU46|\n|Exercisable at end of year| |0|CU40|38,000|CU40| |\n\nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was CU52. The options outstanding at 31 December 20X5 had an exercise price of CU40 or CU50, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.64 years.\n\nNote that the illustrative example is not intended to be a template or model and is therefore not exhaustive. For example, it does not illustrate the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 47(c), 48 and 49 of the Standard.\n\nAASB 2-compiled 55 IMPLEMENTATION Authorised Version F2022C00493 registered 28/04/2022",
